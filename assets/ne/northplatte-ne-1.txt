§ 30.026 CLOSED SESSIONS.
   (A)   (1)   Any public body may hold a closed session by the affirmative
vote of a majority of its voting members if a closed session is clearly
necessary for the protection of the public interest or for the prevention of
needless injury to the reputation of an individual and if such individual has
not requested a public meeting. Closed sessions may be held for reasons such
as, but not limited to, the following:

discussion of the appointment or election of a new member to any public body.
   (B)   The vote to hold a closed session shall be taken in open session. The
vote of each member on the question of holding a closed session, the reason for
the closed session and the time when the closed session commenced and concluded
shall be recorded in the minutes. The public body holding such a closed session
shall restrict its consideration to matters during the closed portions to only
those purposes set forth in the minutes as the reason for the closed session.
The meeting shall be reconvened in open session before any formal action may be
taken.
   (C)   Any member of any public body shall have the right to challenge the
continuation of a closed session if the member determines that the session has
exceeded the reason stated in the original motion to hold a closed session or
if the member contends that the closed session is not clearly necessary for the
protection of the public interest or the prevention of needless injury to the
reputation of an individual. The challenge shall be overruled only by a
majority vote of the members of the public body. The challenge and its
disposition shall be recorded in the minutes.
   (D)   (1)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that any
meeting be closed to the public.
      (2)   No person or public body shall fail to invite a portion of its
members to a meeting nor shall a public body designate itself a subcommittee of
the whole body for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this
subchapter, nor shall any closed session, informal meeting, chance meeting,
social gathering or electronic communication be used for the purpose of
circumventing the provisions of this subchapter.
      (3)   The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to chance
meetings, or to attendance at or travel to conventions or workshops of members
of a public body at which there is no meeting of the body then intentionally
convened and there is no vote or other action taken regarding any matter over
which the public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power.

§ 30.027 EMERGENCY MEETINGS.

any formal action taken in the meeting shall pertain only to the emergency. The
emergency meetings may be held by means of electronic or telecommunication
equipment. The provisions of §
30.029 shall be complied with in conducting emergency meetings. Complete
minutes of the emergency meetings specifying the nature of the emergency and

§ 30.028 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.
   (A)   Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, the public shall have
the right to attend and the right to speak at meetings of public bodies, and
all or any part of a meeting of a public body except for closed meetings called
pursuant to §
30.026 may be videotaped, televised, photographed, broadcast or recorded by any
person in attendance by means of a tape recorder, camera, video equipment or
any other means of pictorial or sonic reproduction, or in writing.
   (B)   It shall not be a violation of this section for any public body to
make and enforce reasonable rules and regulations regarding the conduct of
persons attending, speaking at, videotaping, televising, photographing,
broadcasting or recording its meetings. A body may not be required to allow
citizens to speak at each meeting, but it may not forbid public participation
at all meetings. [No public body shall require members of the public to
identify themselves as a condition for admission to the meeting nor shall such
body require that the name of any member of the public be placed on the agenda
prior to such meeting in order to speak about items on the agenda.] The body
may require any member of the public desiring to address the body to identify
himself or herself. No public body shall for the purpose of circumventing the
provisions of this subchapter hold a meeting in a place known by the body to be
too small to accommodate the anticipated audience. No public body shall be
deemed in violation of this section if it holds its meeting in its traditional
meeting place which is located in this state. An agency which contracts with
municipalities outside the state may hold meetings of any committee outside the
state if the meetings are held only in the contracting municipality. Final
action on any agenda item shall only be taken by the agency at a meeting in the
state, which meeting shall comply with Neb. RS 84-1408—84-1414. The public body
shall, upon request, make a reasonable effort to accommodate the public’s right
to hear the discussion and testimony presented at the meeting. Public bodies
shall make available at the meeting, for examination and copying by members of
the public, at least 1 copy of all reproducible written material to be
discussed at an open meeting.

place of each meeting, and the subjects to be discussed at that meeting.

the City Council, the object of which shall be submitted to the Council in
writing. The call and object, as well as the disposition thereof, shall be
entered upon the journal by the City Clerk. On filing the call for a special
meeting, the City Clerk shall notify the Council members of the special
meeting, stating the time and its purpose. Notice of a special meeting need not
be given to a Council member known to be out of the state, or physically unable
to be present.

   (B)   (1)   At the hour appointed for the meeting, the City Clerk shall

when an action is brought to determine whether the measure is subject to
limited referendum or referendum, or whether a measure may be enacted by
initiative, and

a reasonable time within which the officer may give a new bond or additional
sureties as directed. If the officer should fail, refuse or neglect to give a

drivers shall not be considered officers for purposes of this section, with
respect to their duties as firefighters and ambulance drivers.
   (B)   No officer of the city shall be permitted to benefit from any contract
to which the city is a party. The existence of such an interest in any contract
renders the contract voidable by decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as
to any person who entered into the contract or took assignment thereof with
actual knowledge of the prohibited conflict. An action to have a contract
declared void under this section may be brought by the city or by any resident
thereof and must be brought within 1 year after the contract is signed or

market value or which represents more than 10% equity interest.
      (2)   Will receive a direct pecuniary fee or commission as a result of

involved in the contract and has no ownership interest or will not receive a
pecuniary fee, the officer shall not be deemed to have an interest within the
meaning of this section.
   (C)   The provisions of this section shall not apply if the interested
officer:
      (1)   Makes a declaration on the record to the governmental body
responsible for approving the contract regarding the nature and extent of his
or her interest, prior to official consideration of the contract;
      (2)   Does not vote on the matter of granting the contract, except that,
if the number of members of the board declaring an interest in the contract
would prevent the board, with all members present, from securing a quorum on
the issue, then all members may vote on the matter; and

contract in which he or she has an interest.

issues of the contract which are generally applicable to all employees or all

spouse or child for special action. If an officer has the power to employ
personnel and he or she hires his or her parent, spouse or child, the officer
shall disclose the hiring pursuant to divisions (E)(1)(a) through (e) of this
section, except that, if the parent, spouse or child is already employed in the
position at the time the officer takes office and the position does not change,
no disclosure need be made. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section, any contract entered into with an interested officer shall be subject
to applicable competitive bidding requirements and shall be fair and reasonable
to the city.
   (E)   (1)   The City Clerk shall maintain, separately from other records, a
ledger containing the information listed in divisions (E)(1)(a) through (e) of
this section about every contract entered into by the city in which an officer
has an interest as specified in this section for which disclosure is made as
provided in divisions (C)(1) through (3) of this section. Such information
shall be kept in the ledger for 5 years from the date of the officer’s last day
in office, and shall include:
         (a)   The names of the contracting parties;
         (b)   The nature of the interest of the officer in question;
         (c)   The date that the contract was approved by the city;

during the normal working hours of the office in which it is kept.

thereof, with a business in which an officer has an interest, shall be deemed a

account is opened. Thereafter, the Clerk shall maintain a running account of
all amounts purchased on the open account. Purchases made from petty cash or a

section contracts involving $100 or less in which an officer of the city may
have an interest.
   (I)   No officer shall receive any pay or perquisites from the city other

of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning
regulation, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other

detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be

purposes of convenience, profit or caprice; and

significance such as historic properties or sites which:
      (1)   Exemplify or reflect the broad cultural, political, economic or

or architect whose individual genius influenced an age; or
      (5)   Is part of or related to a city center, park or other distinctive
area, which should be developed or preserved according to a plan based on a
historic, cultural or architectural motif; or owing to its unique location or
singular physical characteristic, represents an established and familiar visual
feature of a neighborhood, community or the City of North Platte; or
      (6)   Its archeological importance has yielded or is likely to yield
information important regarding the history of the area prior to the
establishment of the City of North Platte.
   (F)   Powers and duties.
      (1)   Designation. The Commission shall have the power, subject hereto,
to designate historic properties and historic sites and to recommend
designation of historic districts within city limits. The designation shall be
made based on criteria herein. Historic districts shall be approved by the City
Council. Once designated, the historic properties, sites, improvements and
districts shall be subject to all provisions of the code.
      (2)   Certificate of appropriateness for demolition.
         (a)   No permit to demolish all or part of the exterior of a historic
property or object or a contributing property in a historic district shall be
granted to demolish the property without first receiving a certificate of
appropriateness for demolition from the Commission.
         (b)   At the time that the person applies for a permit to demolish,
the application shall be filed with the Commission. The Commission may decide
to grant the certificate of appropriateness for demolition or to issue a
certificate for demolition delay. If the Commission fails to act on the
application for certificate of appropriateness for demolition within 45 days of
the application date, it will be deemed as issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness for demolition. During the period, the applicant and the
Commission shall cooperate in attempting to avoid demolition of the property.
If the Commission issues a certificate of demolition delay, the applicant must
wait a period of 60 days before proceeding with demolition of the property,
during which period the applicant will work with the Commission and other
interested parties to achieve viable alternatives to demolition. If at the end
of 60 days a viable alternative to demolition has not been determined, the
demolition permit will be granted to the applicant.
         (c)   In determining whether to issue a certificate of appropriateness
for demolition, the Commission shall consider and may give weight to any or all
of the following:
            1.   Whether the property or site is of such architectural or
historic significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the public
interest and contrary to the general welfare of the city and the state;
            2.   Whether the property or site, although not itself a designated
historic structure, contributes to the distinctive architectural or historic
character of the district as a whole and therefore should be preserved for the
benefit of the city and state;
            3.   Whether the property or site is of an old and unusual or
uncommon design, texture, and/or material that it could not be reproduced or be
reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense;
            4.   Whether the property or site is in such a deteriorated
condition that it is not structurally or economically feasible to preserve or
restore it, provided, however, any hardship or difficulty claimed by the owner
which is self-created or which is the result of inexcusable neglect to maintain
the property in good repair shall not qualify as a basis for the issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness;
            5.   Whether the delay of the permit would result in the loss of
all reasonable and beneficial use of or return from the property.
      (3)   Other duties. In addition to those duties already specified in this
section, the Commission shall:
         (a)   Work for the continued education of the citizens about the
historical heritage of North Platte and the historic property designations
under the provision of this section;
         (b)   Cooperate with the State of Nebraska Historical Preservation
Office and the Nebraska Historic Preservation Review Board in attempting to
include such properties hereunder designated as historic structures or historic
sites, or historic districts in the National Register of Historic Places;

of historic preservation in the city. The funds shall be placed in a special
city account for such purposes.

expenditures for that fund, by a majority vote transfer money from other funds
to the fund. No expenditure during the fiscal year shall be made in excess of
the amounts indicated in the adopted budget statement, except as authorized in
this subchapter. If, as the result of unforeseen circumstances, the revenue of
the current fiscal year shall be insufficient, the governing body may propose
to supplement the previously adopted budget statement and shall conduct a
public hearing at which time any taxpayer may appear, or file a written
statement protesting the application for additional money. A written record
shall be kept of all such hearings. Notice of a place and time for the hearing
shall be published at least 5 days prior to the date set for the hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city. The published notice shall set
forth the time and place of the proposed hearing, the amount of additional
money required, the purpose of the required money, a statement setting forth
the reasons why the adopted budget of expenditures cannot be reduced to meet
the need for original money and a copy of the summary of the originally adopted
budget previously published. Upon the conclusion of the public hearing on the
proposed supplemental budget and the approval of the governing body, the
governing body shall file with the County Clerk and the State Auditor a copy of
the supplemental budget and shall certify the amount of additional tax to be
levied. The governing body may then issue warrants in payment for expenditures
authorized by the adopted supplemental budget. The warrants shall be referred
to as registered warrants, and shall be repaid during the next fiscal year from
funds derived from taxes levied therefor.
(Prior Code, § 2-312)
§ 34.32 SINKING FUNDS.
   The governing body, subject to the limitations set forth in this subchapter,

upon the assessed value of all taxable property within the city for a term not
to exceed that prescribed by state law, in addition to the amount of tax which
may be annually levied for the purposes of the adopted budget statement of the
city, for the purpose of establishing a sinking fund for the construction,
purchase, improvement, extension or repair of the approved uses as authorized
by state law. To initiate the sinking fund, the governing body shall declare
its purpose by resolution to submit to the qualified electors of the city the
proposition to provide the improvement at the next general city election. The
resolution shall set forth the improvement, the estimated cost, the amount of
the annual levy, the number of years required to provide the required revenue,
the name of the sinking fund proposed, and the proposition as it will appear on
the ballot. Notice of the proposition shall be published in its entirety 3
times on successive weeks before the day of the election in a legal newspaper
of general circulation in the city. The sinking fund may be established after
the election if a majority or more of the legal votes were in favor of the
establishment of the fund. The governing body may then proceed to establish the
fund in conformity with the provisions of the proposition and applicable state
law. The funds received by the City Treasurer shall, as they accumulate, be
immediately invested with the written approval of the governing body in the
manner provided by state law. No sinking fund so established shall be used for
any purpose contrary to the purpose as it appeared on the ballot unless the
governing body is authorized to do so by 60% of the qualified electors of the
city voting at a general election favoring such a change in the use of the
sinking fund.

general improvements, such as water extensions, sewers, public heating systems,
bridges or work on streets, any motor or other mechanical equipment, including

cost thereof shall be made by the City Engineer and submitted to the Council,
and no contract shall be entered into for any such work or improvement, or for
the purchase of the equipment, for any price exceeding $30,000, without
advertising for bids, unless the contract shall be entered into for the benefit
of the city’s Electric Utility. A city electric utility may enter into a
contract for any such work or improvement or for the purchase of such equipment

$60,000 or less and the city’s Electric Utility has gross annual revenue from
retail sales in excess of $1,000,000, the price is $90,000 or less and the

has gross annual revenue from retail sales in excess of $10,000,000. In
advertising for bids for any such work, or for the purchase of the equipment,
the Council shall cause the amount of the estimate to be published therewith.

general circulation published in the city. In case of a public emergency
resulting from infectious or contagious diseases, destructive windstorms,
floods, snow, war or an exigency or pressing necessity or unforeseen need
calling for immediate action or remedy to prevent a serious loss of or serious
injury or damage to life, health or property, estimates of costs and
advertising for bids may be waived in the emergency ordinance when adopted by a
3/4 vote of the Council and entered on the record. If, after advertising for
bids as provided in this section, the governing body receives fewer than 2 bids
on a contract for any work or improvement, or if the bids received by the
governing body contain a price which exceeds the estimated cost of the project,
the governing body shall have the authority to negotiate a contract in an
attempt to complete the proposed project at a cost commensurate with the
estimate given.
   (B)   If the materials are of such a nature that, in the opinion of the
manufacturer and with the concurrence of the governing body, no cost can be
estimated until the materials have been manufactured or assembled to the
specific qualifications of the city, the governing body may authorize the
manufacture and assemblage of the materials and may thereafter approve the
estimated cost expenditure when it is provided by the manufacturer. The city
bidding procedure shall be waived when materials or equipment are purchased at
the same price and from the same seller as materials or equipment which have
formerly been obtained pursuant to the state bidding procedure.

discharged, suspended with or without pay, demoted, reduced in rank or deprived
of vacation, benefits, compensation or other privileges, except pension
benefits, for any of the following reasons:
      (1)   Incompetency, inefficiency or inattention to or dereliction of
duty;
      (2)   Dishonesty, prejudicial conduct, immoral conduct, insubordination,
discourteous treatment of the public or a fellow employee, any act of omission

violation of the Civil Service Act or the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to the Act;
      (3)   Mental or physical unfitness for the position which the employee
holds;
      (4)   Drunkenness or the use of intoxicating liquors, narcotics or any
other habit-forming drug, liquid or preparation to such an extent that the use

precludes the employee from properly performing the functions and duties of his
or her position;
      (5)   Conviction of a felony or misdemeanor tending to injure the
employee’s ability to effectively perform the duties of his or her position; or
      (6)   Any other act or failure to act which, in the judgment of the Civil
Service Commission, is sufficient to justify the offender to be an unsuitable
and unfit person to be employed in the public service.
   (C)   Procedure. The disciplinary action procedure set out in this division
shall apply to all civil service employees, except that, in the case of the
Fire Chief and Police Chief, the Mayor, by and with the consent of a majority
of the Council, shall make the decision concerning removal, suspension,
demotion or discharge; provided that, the same procedure shall be followed,
including notices and time limitations.
      (1)   No employee in the civil service who shall have been permanently
appointed or inducted into civil service shall be removed, suspended, demoted
or discharged except for cause, and then only upon the written accusation of
the Police Chief or Fire Chief, the City Administrator or any citizen or
taxpayer.
      (2)   The written accusation shall set forth the alleged misconduct,
charges or grounds for investigation against the employee. The written
accusation shall be filed by the complainant with the Secretary of the
Commission, who shall cause a copy of the written accusation to be delivered
within 3 working days after the filing to the Police Chief or Fire Chief, to
the City Administrator, and to the employee personally or by certified mail
addressed to the employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the
personnel records. The Secretary of the Commission shall cause a return showing
such delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the secretary’s office.
      (3)   The Police Chief or Fire Chief shall have the authority to
immediately suspend, with pay, an employee against whom such written accusation
has been filed, pending the confirmation of the suspension or a decision of the
City Administrator to reinstate the employee or remove, demote, discharge or
suspend the employee, with or without pay. In the case of the Police Chief or
Fire Chief, the City Administrator shall have the authority to immediately
suspend, with pay, the Police Chief or Fire Chief against whom a written
accusation has been filed, pending the confirmation of the suspension or a
decision of the Mayor and Council to reinstate the Chief or remove, demote,
discharge or suspend the Chief, with or without pay.
      (4)   (a)   Prior to the decision of the City Administrator to reinstate
the employee or remove, demote, discharge or suspend the employee, with or
without pay, the Police Chief or Fire Chief shall, within a reasonable period
of time, investigate the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds against the
employee and explain the basis of the employer’s evidence to the employee and
provide the employee an opportunity to present his or her version of the
circumstances which resulted in the filing of the written accusation. If the
Chiefs’ investigation reveals other misconduct, charges or grounds, the Chief
shall amend the written accusation to include the other misconduct, charges or
grounds by filing an amendment to the written accusation with the Secretary of
the Commission, who shall cause a copy of the amended accusation to be
delivered within 3 working days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays,
after the filing to the Police Chief or Fire Chief, to the City Administrator,
and to the employee personally or by certified mail addressed to the employee
at the residence address of the employee shown in the personnel records. The
Secretary of the Commission shall cause a return showing the delivery or
mailing to be executed and filed in the Secretary’s office. If the Police Chief
or Fire Chief is being disciplined, the City Administrator shall follow the
same procedures as are followed by the Police Chief or Fire Chief in
disciplining employees under this section. Upon completion of this procedure
within a reasonable period of time, the Police Chief or Fire Chief shall
recommend in writing to the City Administrator that the alleged misconduct,
charges or grounds set forth in the written accusation be deemed:
            1.   To be without merit;
            2.   To not warrant disciplinary action;
            3.   To warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal,
demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or
written reprimand; or
            4.   To warrant removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or
without pay.
         (b)   In the case of an accusation made against the Police Chief or
Fire Chief, it shall be the duty of the City Administrator to investigate the
allegations and perform those tasks and duties otherwise assigned to the Chief
in the case of other civil service employees, and it shall be the duty of the
City Administrator to perform the tasks and duties otherwise placed with the
Chiefs as provided in division (C) of this section in the case of disciplinary
actions against the Chiefs. Concerning all duties and tasks assigned the City
Administrator in division (C) of this section, the duties and tasks shall be
the duty and responsibility of the Mayor and Council in disciplinary actions
against the Police Chief and Fire Chief.
      (5)   (a)   Within ten calendar days after receiving the written
recommendation of the Police Chief or Fire Chief, the City Administrator shall
decide to accept the recommendation of the Police Chief or Fire Chief, or shall
decide that the alleged misconduct, charges or grounds for investigation
against the employee set forth in the written accusation be deemed:
            1.   To be without merit;
            2.   To not warrant disciplinary action;
            3.   To warrant disciplinary action less severe than removal,
demotion, discharge or suspension, with or without pay, such as an oral or
written reprimand; or
            4.   To warrant removal, demotion, discharge or suspension, with or
without pay.
         (b)   The City Administrator shall file a copy of his or her decision
within 10 calendar days after receiving the written recommendation of the
Police Chief or Fire Chief, with the Secretary of the Civil Service Commission,
who shall cause a copy of the decision to be delivered within 3 working days,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after the filing to the Police Chief
or Fire Chief, and to the employee, personally or by certified mail, addressed
to the employee at the residence address of the employee shown in the personnel
records. The Secretary of the Commission shall cause a return showing the
delivery or mailing to be executed and filed in the Secretary’s office.
      (6)   Any employee so removed, suspended, demoted or discharged may,
within 10 calendar days after receiving written notice of the City
Administrator’s decision, or in the case of the Police Chief or Fire Chief,
notice from the Mayor and Council, file a written demand for an investigation
and public hearing by the Civil Service Commission. The employee shall file the
request for the hearing with the Secretary of the Commission and simultaneously
send a copy of the request to the City Administrator. The failure to file the a
request with the Secretary of the Commission within 10 calendar days of receipt
of notice of the action by the City Administrator shall constitute a waiver of
the employee’s right to review by the Civil Service Commission and the City
Administrator’s decision shall become final.
      (7)   Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the employee’s notice of
appeal, the City Administrator shall cause to be mailed or delivered following
notice to the employee and the Secretary of the Civil Service Commission a
notice containing:
         (a)   A statement of the charges;
         (b)   The names of the witnesses who will be called on behalf of the
city and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and
         (c)   Copies of the documents to be introduced.
      (8)   Within 10 calendar days after the filing of the written demand for
an investigation and public hearing by the Commission, the employee shall mail
or deliver copies of the following to both the City Administrator and the
Commission:
         (a)   A response to the statement of the charges;
         (b)   The names of witnesses who will be called on behalf of the
employee and a general statement of the nature of their testimony; and
         (c)   Copies of the documents to be introduced.
      (9)   Upon receipt of a written demand, the Commission shall conduct an
investigation. The Commission may be represented in such investigation and
public hearing by the City Attorney if authorized by the City Administrator. If
the City Attorney does not represent the Commission, the Commission may be
represented by special counsel appointed by the Commission for the
investigation and hearing. The investigation shall consist solely of a review
of the written submissions of the City Administrator and employee to determine
whether any individuals or documents should be subpoenaed by the Commission for
the subsequent public hearing before the Commission ultimately to determine
whether the City Administrator acted in good faith for cause. For purposes of
this division, GOOD FAITH for cause shall mean that the action was not
arbitrary or capricious and was not made for political or religious reasons.
      (10)   The Commission shall schedule a public hearing not less than 10
and not more than 20 calendar days from the date of filing of the employee’s
written demand for an investigation. The Commission shall notify the City
Administrator and employee in writing, at least 10 calendar days prior to the
date of the hearing, of the date, time and place of hearing.
      (11)   The City Administrator shall be permitted to appear in person and
by counsel and to present his or her case. The City Administrator may present
evidence by testimony and documents and shall be permitted to cross examine the
employee’s witnesses. At the hearing, the employee shall be permitted to appear
in person and by counsel and to present his or her defense. The employee may
present evidence by testimony and documents and shall be permitted to cross
examine the witnesses called by the City Administrator.
      (12)   The Commission may affirm the action taken by the City
Administrator, if the action is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
If the Commission finds that the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was
made for political or religious reasons or was not made in good faith for
cause, it shall order the immediate reinstatement or reemployment of the
employee in the position or employment from which the employee was removed,
suspended, demoted or discharged, which reinstatement shall, if the Commission,
in its discretion, so provides, be retroactive and entitle the person to
compensation and restoration of benefits and privileges from the time of the
removal, suspension, demotion or discharge.
      (13)   After the hearing, in lieu of affirming the removal, suspension,
demotion or discharge, the Commission may modify the order of removal,
suspension, demotion or discharge by directing a suspension, with or without
pay, for a given period, and subsequent restoration to duty or demotion in
position or pay. No later than 10 calendar days after the hearing, the
Commission shall certify its findings in writing to the employee, and to the
City Administrator, who shall enforce them.
(Prior Code, § 40-95)
§ 35.045 REDUCTION IN FORCE POLICY.
   (A)   Establishment. The Mayor and Council, in establishing a reduction in

§ 35.081 RETIRING OFFICER; ANNUITY OPTIONS; HOW DETERMINED; LUMP-SUM PAYMENT
OPTION.
   (A)   At any time before the retirement date, the retiring police officer
may elect to receive at his retirement date a pension benefit either in the
form of a straight life annuity or any optional form of annuity benefit
established by the Retirement Committee and provided under a purchased annuity
contract. The optional annuity benefit shall be specified in the funding medium
for the retirement system and shall include a straight life annuity with a
guarantee of at least 60 monthly payments or an annuity payable for the life of
the retiring police officer and, after the death of the retiree, monthly
payments, as elected by the retiring police officer, of either 100%, 75% or 50%
of the amount of annuity payable to the retiring police officer during his or
her life, to the beneficiary selected by the retiring police officer at the
time of the original application for an annuity. For any police officer whose
retirement date is on or after January 1, 1997, the optional benefit forms for
the retirement system shall include a single lump-sum payment of the police
officer’s retirement value. The retiring police officer may further elect to
defer the date of the first annuity payment or lump-sum payment to the first
day of any specified month prior to age 70. If the retiring police officer
elects to receive his or her pension benefit in the form of an annuity, the
amount of annuity benefit shall be the amount paid by the annuity contract
purchased or otherwise provided by his or her retirement value as of the date
of the first payment. Any such annuity contract purchased by the retirement
system may be distributed to the police officer and, upon the distribution, all
obligations of the retirement system to pay retirement, death or disability
benefits to the police officer and his beneficiaries shall terminate, without
exception.
   (B)   (1)   For all officers employed on January 1, 1984, and continuously
employed by the city from the date through the date of their retirement, the
amount of the pension benefit, when determined on the straight life annuity
basis, shall not be less than the following amounts:
         (a)   If retirement occurs following age 60 and with 25 years of
service with the city, or 21 years of service if hired prior to November 18,
1965, 50% of regular pay; or
         (b)   If retirement occurs following age 55 but before age 60 and with
25 years of service with the city, 40% of regular pay.
      (2)   A police officer entitled to a minimum pension benefit under this
division may elect to receive such pension benefit in any form permitted by
division (A) of this section, including a single lump-sum payment, if the
officer retires on or after January 1, 1997, or if the city has adopted a lump-
sum distribution option for officers retiring before January 1, 1997, in the
funding medium for the retirement system. If the minimum pension benefit is
paid in a form other than a straight life annuity, the benefit shall be the
actuarial equivalent of the straight life annuity that would otherwise be paid
to the officer pursuant to this division.
      (3)   If the police officer chooses the single lump-sum payment option,
the officer can request that the actuarial equivalent be equal to the average
of the cost of 3 annuity contracts purchased on the open market. Of the 3
annuity contracts used for comparison, 1 shall be chosen by the police officer,
1 shall be chosen by the Retirement Committee and 1 shall be chosen by the
city.
   (C)   If the retirement value of an officer entitled to a minimum pension
benefit under division (B) of this section is not sufficient at the time of the
first payment to purchase or provide the required pension benefit, the city
shall transfer the funds as may be necessary to the employer account of the
police officer so that the retirement value of the officer is sufficient to

   (A)   When prior to retirement any police officer participating in the
retirement system dies other than in the line of duty and except as provided in
division (B) of this section, the entire retirement value shall be payable to
the beneficiary or beneficiaries specified by the deceased police officer prior
to his or her death or to the deceased police officer’s estate if no
beneficiary was specified. The retirement value or portion thereof to be
received by the beneficiary may be paid in the form of a single lump-sum

or otherwise provided by the amount of the beneficiary’s share of the
retirement value as of the date of the first payment. Upon the purchase and
distribution of such annuity contract to the beneficiary, all obligations of
the retirement system to the beneficiary shall terminate, without exception.
   (B)   If any police officer employed by such city as a member of its paid

§ 35.085 DISABILITY IN THE LINE OF DUTY; BENEFIT; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   If any police officer becomes disabled, the police officer shall be
placed upon the roll of pensioned police officers at the regular retirement
pension of 50% of regular pay for the period of the disability. For purposes of
this section, DISABILITY shall mean the complete inability of the police
officer, for reasons of accident or other cause while in the line of duty, to
perform the duties of a police officer.
   (B)   No disability benefit payment shall be made except upon adequate proof
furnished to the city, the proof to consist of a medical examination conducted
by a competent, disinterested physician who is duly licensed to practice
medicine and surgery in this state and who certifies to the city that the
police officer is unable to perform the duties of a police officer. The city,
during the first 3 years of the payment of the benefits, shall have the right,
at reasonable times, to require the disabled police officer to undergo a
medical examination at the city’s expense to determine the continuance of the
disability claimed. After the 3-year period, the city may request the District
Court to order the police officer to submit proof of the continuance of the
disability claimed if the city has reasonable grounds to believe the police
officer is fraudulently receiving disability payments. The city shall have the
right to demand a physical examination of the police officer by a competent,
disinterested physician who is duly licensed to practice medicine and surgery
in this state, and who is chosen by the city. The expense of the examination
shall be borne by the city.
   (C)   In case of temporary disability of a police officer received while in
the line of duty, he or she shall receive his or her salary during the
continuance of the disability for a period not to exceed 12 months, except that
if it is ascertained by the City Council or other proper municipal authorities
within 12 months that the temporary disability has become a disability as
defined in this section, then the salary shall cease and he or she shall be
entitled to the benefits for pensions in case of disability as provided in this
section.
   (D)   All payments of pension or salary provided by this section shall be
subject to deduction of amounts paid under the state’s Workers’ Compensation
Act. The payments shall not commence until all credit for unused annual or sick
leave and other similar credits have been fully utilized by the disabled police
officer if there will be no impairment to his or her salary during the period
of disability. Total payments to a disabled police officer, in excess of
amounts paid as workers’ compensation benefits, shall not be less than the
retirement value at the date of disability. If the actuarial equivalent of the
disability pension payable under this section exceeds the police officer’s
retirement value at the time of the first payment, the city shall contribute
such additional amounts as may be necessary, from time to time, to provide for
the required disability pension.
   (E)   If a police officer who was pensioned under this section is later
determined to be no longer disabled, the pension provided for under this
section shall terminate and the police officer’s vested retirement value, as
reduced by any disability payments made from the retirement system, shall
thereafter be held and administered in the same manner as for any nondisabled
police officer or former police officer.
   (F)   (1)   If a police officer who has pensioned under this section is
later determined to be no longer disabled during the first 3 years when
disability benefit payments are being paid the police officer may return to
duty with the police force under the following conditions:
         (a)   If a vacancy exists on the police force for which the police
officer is qualified and the police officer wishes to return to the police
force, the city shall hire the police officer to fill the vacancy at a pay
grade of not less than his or her previous pay grade; or
         (b)   If no vacancy exists on the police force and the police officer
wishes to return to the police force, the city may create a vacancy under the
city’s reduction in force policy adopted under the Civil Service Act and rehire
the officer at a pay grade of not less than his or her previous pay grade.
      (2)   The provisions of this division shall not apply to a police officer
whose disability benefit payments are terminated because of fraud on the part
of the police officer.

under Neb. RS 48-101 et seq. All state workers’ compensation benefits shall be
payable in full to such police officer as provided in Neb. RS 48-101 et seq.,
but all amounts paid by the city or its insurer under §§
35.075 to
35.093 to any disabled police officer entitled to receive a salary during the

as determined at the valuation date preceding his or her termination of
employment. Such police officer, if vested, shall also receive a deferred

the date of retirement. The retirement value at the retirement date shall
consist of the accumulated value of the police officer’s employee account, as
reduced by any lump-sum distributions received prior to retirement, together
with a vested percentage of the accumulated value of the police officer’s
employer account at the date of retirement.
   (B)   The vesting schedule shall be as follows:

for less than 4 years, the vesting shall be nil;
      (2)   If the terminating officer has been a member of the paid Department

shall be 40%. The vesting percentage shall be 50% after 5 years, 60% after 6
years, 70% after 7 years, 80% after 8 years, 90% after 9 years and 100% after
10 years; and

month immediately following the police officer’s sixtieth birthday. At the
option of the terminating police officer, the pension benefit may be paid as of
the first of the month after the police officer attains the age of 55. The
election may be made by the police officer any time prior to the payment of the
pension benefits. The deferred pension benefit shall be paid in the form of the
benefit options specified in §
35.081(A) as elected by the police officer. If the police officer’s vested
retirement value at the date of his or her termination of employment is less
than $3,500, the city may elect to pay the police officer his or her vested
retirement value in the form of a single lump-sum payment.
   (D)   Effective January 1, 1997, a police officer may elect upon his or her
termination of employment to receive his or her vested retirement value in the
form of a single lump-sum payment. For a police officer whose termination of
employment is prior to January 1, 1997, this election shall be available only
if the city has adopted a lump-sum distribution option for terminating police
officers in the funding medium established for the retirement system.
   (E)   Upon any lump-sum payment of a terminating police officer’s retirement
value under this section, the police officer will not be entitled to any
deferred pension benefit and the city and the retirement system shall have no
further obligation to pay the police officer or his or her beneficiaries any
benefits under this subchapter.
   (F)   If the terminating police officer is not credited with 100% of his or
her employer account, the non-vested portion of the account shall be forfeited
and first used to meet the expense charges incurred by the city in connection
with administering the police officers retirement system and the remainder
shall then be used to reduce the city contribution which would otherwise be
required to fund pension benefits.

or resident to suffer an immediate and serious health hazard by the
disconnection of the utility’s service to that household. The certificate shall
be filed with the Department of Utilities within 5 days of receiving notice

§ 51.01 ELECTRICAL SERVICE GENERALLY; PROVISIONS CONSTITUTE CONTRACT WITH
CONSUMER.
   The city shall furnish electric current for light, heating, cooking, power
and other purposes to persons within its service area whose premises abut on
any supply wire of the electric distribution system of the city, and may
furnish electric current to such other persons within or without its corporate
limits as and when, according to law, and on such reasonable terms as, the city
may see fit to do so. The rules, regulations and rates for electric service set
out in this chapter shall be deemed and considered a part of every application
hereafter made for electric service to the city and shall be considered a part
of the contract with every customer now served by the city. Without further
formality, the making of application on the part of any applicant for the use
or consumption of electrical energy by present consumers thereof and the
furnishing of electric service to the applicant or customer by the city shall
constitute a contract between the applicant or customer and the city, to which
contract both parties are bound. If the customer shall violate any of the
provisions of the contract or any reasonable rules and regulations that the
city may hereafter adopt, the Utilities Manager, or his or her agent, shall cut
off or disconnect the electric service from the building or place of the
violation, and no further connection for electric service to the building or
place shall again be made, except by order of the Utilities Manager or his or
her agent.
(Prior Code, § 52-31)
§ 51.02 RATES.
   The city shall, from time to time, recommend electrical rates to be charged
to the customers of the city’s Light and Water Department. The Council shall
approve the rates recommended before the city shall put them into effect. Upon
approval of these rates by the City Council, the rates shall be placed on file
with the City Clerk.
(Prior Code, § 52-32)
§ 51.03 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.
   Every person desiring a supply of electric current shall make application
therefor to the city upon blanks to be furnished for that purpose, which
application shall be made to the Utilities Manager in the city’s Water and
Light Building. The application shall state truly and fully all the uses to
which the electric current is to be applied, and no additional use will be
allowed except by permission of the city or the Utilities Manager.
(Prior Code, § 52-33)
§ 51.04 SERVICE CONNECTION; DEPOSIT.
   (A)   Overhead service wires. When an application shall be made for electric
service to the city and accepted by the Utilities Manager, the city will run or
cause to be run overhead service wires, when the service is available, to the
customer’s attachment at the nearest reasonable location on the building or
pole of the applicant or customer, and thereafter will keep the service wires
in good repair and safe condition at the expense of the city. The wires for
overhead service shall be considered the property of the city.
   (B)   Underground service wires. If the customer requests underground
service, the service wires shall be the property of the customer and the
customer shall be responsible for keeping the underground service wires in good
repair and in a safe condition.
   (C)   Deposit. Applicants for electric service shall be required to
accompany their application with a service deposit, to ensure the prompt
payment of electric service bills and other charges, in an amount in each case
as the Manager shall determine, taking into consideration the volume of service
and the type of meter necessary to measure the volume of service under
conditions acceptable to the manager. A financial guarantee bond may be
substituted in lieu of the required cash deposit. All meters and instrument
transformers required for measuring electric current used by the applicant or
customer shall be furnished, shall be set in place and shall remain the
property of the city. All service deposits shall be managed by the city and
shall be refunded to the customer when service is no longer desired, subject to
conditions as provided in this chapter. Not more than 1 house or building shall
be supplied from 1 connection except by special permission.
(Prior Code, § 52-34)
§ 51.05 TAMPERING WITH METER.
   No electric service customer shall be permitted to take current for
residence or commercial lighting purposes at power rates, nor shall any
lighting apparatus be attached or suffered to remain attached to any power
meter. It shall be unlawful for any person to employ any scheme, device or
contrivance for the purpose of evading the proper service and registration of
any meter or to employ any scheme or device whereby he or she may obtain
current which does not pass through the meter furnished him or her by the city.
Finding lighting apparatus attached to a power meter or any device in or near
any meter which causes the meter to register incorrectly shall be prima facie
evidence of the intent of the occupier of the premises, or of the customer, to
convert electric current to his or her own use, which is hereby declared
unlawful and the person convicted of the violation shall be punished as
provided in this chapter. If it shall appear to the city that any light or
power meter shall have been tapped or tampered with, it is hereby empowered to
direct the Utilities Manager to install or cause to be installed, at the
customer’s expense, a meter installed in iron conduit mechanically sealed in a
closed meter box accessible only to the city or its agents.
(Prior Code, § 52-35) Penalty, see §
51.99
§ 51.06 ACCESS TO PREMISES.

§ 51.07 CONNECTIONS WITH SUPPLY WIRES TO BE MADE BY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.
   Under no circumstances shall connections be made with the wires of the
electric distribution system and supply wires and the wires of customer except
by an employee or agent of the city.
(Prior Code, § 52-38)
§ 51.08 SERVICE CONTRACTS NOT TRANSFERABLE; NOTICE TO DISCONTINUE SERVICE TO
PREMISES.
   Contracts for electric service are not transferable. Any person wishing to
change from 1 location to another shall make a new application and sign a new
contract. If any customer shall sell, dispose of or move from the premises
where service is furnished, or if the premises are destroyed by fire or other
casualty, he or she shall, at once, so inform the Utilities Manager, who shall
cause the electric current to be shut off from the premises. If the customer
shall fail to give the notice, he or she shall be charged for all electric
current used on the premises until the city or its agent is otherwise advised
of the change.
(Prior Code, § 52-39)
§ 51.09 COMPUTATION OF CHARGES IN CASE OF DEFECTIVE METER.
   Should an electric service customer’s meter become out of repair or fail to
register properly, the customer will be charged for electric current during the
time the meter is out of order or repair on the basis of monthly consumption
during the same month of the preceding year; provided, however, if no basis for
comparison exists, then the customer shall pay such amount as reasonably fixed
by the Utilities Manager.
(Prior Code, § 52-40)
§ 51.10 CITY NOT GUARANTOR OF SERVICE; RIGHT OF CITY TO DISCONTINUE SERVICE.
   (A)   The city does not guarantee the delivery of electric current over the
lines of its distribution system at any time, to any person, except when its
power and connections are in good working order and it has sufficient power,
current, equipment and machinery so to do. The city expressly reserves the
right to disconnect or discontinue the service for any of the following
reasons:
      (1)   For repairs necessary to be made on any part of its plant, power
house, equipment, system or distribution system;
      (2)   For non-payment of bills when due;
      (3)   For fraudulent representations in regard to the consumption of
current for light, cooking, heat and power;
      (4)   For the protection of persons or property; and/or
      (5)   For violation of any of the rules or requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The city shall use due and reasonable diligence to provide and supply
uninterrupted service to customers, but shall not be liable for damages
resulting from interruption of service due to causes over which the city has no
control, and the city expressly reserves the right to discontinue or disconnect
any customer’s service without any preliminary notice.
(Prior Code, § 52-41)
§ 51.11 REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF METERS; LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF METER OR
SERVICE WIRE.
   No person, except an authorized agent of the city, shall be allowed to set
the meters as mentioned in this chapter, or to make connections to the electric
service of the city. The owner or tenant of premises where a meter is located
shall provide ready and convenient access to the meter so that it may easily be
examined and read by the city or its authorized agents. Any customer of
electric current from the city has the right to request the city to test his or
her meter any reasonable number of times, and the city or its agents shall
comply with the request, subject to such reasonable rules and regulations as
the city may adopt. The city reserves the right to test and replace any meter
in use at any time. The city will keep clean and in proper repair and will
replace without cost to customer any service meter where the repair or
replacement results from ordinary wear and tear and not from the wilful
negligence or recklessness of customer. In consideration of the service
rendered or to be rendered in the matter or repairing or replacing the meter,
the applicant or customer specifically consents and agrees to keep all service
meters and service wires insured for the benefit of city against fire or other
casualty and hereby designates the Utilities Manager as his or her agent or
attorney in fact to collect from the insurance carrier, in the event of the
loss or destruction of the meter or service wire by fire or other casualty,
from the proceeds payable to customer out of any policy of insurance in which
he or she is made beneficiary affecting the premises where the meter or service
wire is located, the reasonable value of the meter or service wire, and deduct
the value from payment to be made to the insured under the policy; provided
that, if the customer carries no insurance on the premises or contents of the
premises or place where the meter is set, the customer hereby consents and
agrees to reimburse the city for the reasonable value of such meter or service
wire in the event of destruction by fire or other casualty.
(Prior Code, § 52-42)

to the city to do so. For furnishing the electric service outside the corporate
limits to other municipalities, other public service companies or government
authorities for purposes of resale, the rates shall be set by the city;
provided that, the contract rate made in such cases shall be uniform insofar as
it affects the users of equal amounts of current under the contracts under
similar circumstances.
(Prior Code, § 52-45)
§ 51.15 DEPOSIT FUND.
   All electric service deposits, when received by the city, shall be held
separate and apart in a fund to be known as the Electric Service Deposit Fund.
This Fund is a trust fund for customers of electric service from the city, and
may be invested by the city as other idle or surplus funds under its
jurisdiction are invested, and such rate of interest per annum may be paid to
the beneficiaries of the fund as the city may determine from time to time.
When, for any reason, electric service is no longer required, the service
deposit shall, upon demand, be returned to the customer by the Utilities
Manager, with proper deductions for unpaid service charges and other arrearages
due the city. The Utilities Manager shall give each applicant or customer a
separate receipt for all service deposits received by this Department.
(Prior Code, § 52-46)

damage to property of the city.
(Prior Code, § 52-48) Penalty, see §
51.99

interfering branches or limbs of trees, so that its lines shall be free and
open.

§ 52.002 AVAILABILITY OF WATER SERVICE.
   In all lands within the corporate limits of the city, or 1 mile thereof,
water service shall be available therein or, upon the creation of water

§ 52.008 WATER SERVICE GENERALLY; PROVISIONS CONSTITUTE CONTRACT WITH CONSUMER.
   The city shall furnish water to persons within its corporate limits whose
premises abut a street or alley in which a city commercial main now is or may
hereafter be laid, and may furnish water to persons within its corporate limits
whose premises do not abut a street or alley in which a city commercial main
now is or may hereafter be laid, and may also furnish water to persons whose
premises are situated outside the corporate limits, as and when, according to
law, the city may see fit to do so. The rules, regulations and water rates
named in this chapter shall be considered a part of every application hereafter
made for water service and shall be considered a part of the contract between
every consumer now or hereafter served by the city. Without further formality,
the making of application on the part of any applicant or the use or
consumption of water service by present consumers thereof and the furnishing of
water service to the applicant or consumer by the city shall constitute a
contract between the consumer and the city, to which contract both parties are
bound. If the consumer shall violate any of the provisions of the contract or
any reasonable rules and regulations that the city may hereafter adopt, the
city or its agent may cut off or disconnect the water service from the building

the County Clerk a certified copy of the report and resolution directing that
the amount assessed against the different premises, as shown by the report, be
placed upon the assessment rolls and tax books of the county for collection as
other taxes. Water will not be turned on in any house or private service pipe,
except upon the order of the city or its duly authorized agent, nor until the
consumer shall have paid the charges due, and plumbers are strictly prohibited
from turning the water into any service pipe except on the order or permission

CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL
§ 52.070 GENERAL POLICY AND PURPOSE; APPLICABILITY OF SUBCHAPTER.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to:
      (1)   Protect the public potable water supply of the city water system
from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating real or
potential sources of contamination or pollutants which may backflow or cause
back siphonage through the service connection into the public potable water
supply system, as required by Title 179, NAC 2 “Regulations Governing Public
Water Supply Systems”;
      (2)   Promote the elimination, containment, isolation or control of
existing cross connections, actual or potential, between the public or
consumer’s potable water systems and non-potable water systems, plumbing
fixtures and industrial process systems; and
      (3)   Provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
   (B)   Applicability. This subchapter shall apply to all premises served by
the public potable water system of the city.
   (C)   Policy.
      (1)   This subchapter will be reasonably interpreted as the city’s intent
to recognize the varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the
degree of protection shall be commensurate with the degree of hazard.
      (2)   The city water division shall be primarily responsible for
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination
or pollution due to backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water
service connection. The cooperation of all consumers is required to implement
and maintain the program to control cross connections. The consumer is
responsible for preventing contamination of the water system within the
consumer’s own premises.
      (3)   If, in the judgment of the Water Division or the state’s Department
of Health or their authorized representative, cross connection protection is
required through either piping modification or installation of an approved
backflow prevention device, 30 days’ notice shall be given to the consumer. The
failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to provide requested
protection with 30 days shall make the consumer subject to discontinuance of
water service at the discretion of the Water Division, according to the degree
of hazard, without further notice.

the duty or of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the
satisfactory correction of the duty or violation. The person shall, within the
period of time, perform the duty or cease the violation; otherwise, for each
24-hour period after the period of time that the person fails, neglects or
refuses to perform the duty or violates the provision, he or she shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished
as provided in division (A) of this section.
   (C)   Additional remedies. In addition to or in lieu of other remedies
provided the city by this section to correct or abate a failure, neglect or
refusal to perform a duty imposed by this chapter or a violation of a provision
of this chapter, the Manager may revoke any permit issued under the provisions
of this chapter, and may effect the discontinuation of water or sewer service,
or the discontinuation of both the services, to the owner of the property. The
Manager may also institute injunction or other appropriate action or
proceeding. However, with the exception of repeated non-accidental discharges
to the public sewers of waters or wastes of the types referred to in §
53.022(B)(1), (2) or (3), the Manager shall give the owner at least 15 days’
written notice before revoking the permit or discontinuing water or sewer
service.
   (D)   Accidental discharges. Any person who accidentally discharges into a
public sewer any waters or wastes of the types referred to in §
53.022(B)(1), (2) or (3) shall immediately notify the Manager by the quickest
means available, supplying him or her will all information pertaining to the
discharge as the Manager may request to enable the Manager to take proper
action to protect persons, the public sewers and sewage treatment processes
which may be endangered by the discharge. Such an accidental discharge shall
not constitute a violation of this chapter, provided that prompt report of such
discharge is made as provided in this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 52-199)
§ 53.052 SEWER USE CHARGE ESTABLISHED; PURPOSE.
   For the purpose of providing revenue for the operation, maintenance,
improvement, enlargement and expansion of the sanitary sewer system of the
city, for the purpose of providing revenue for the prevention of water and
stream pollution by the control of sewage and its discharge, for the purpose of
paying the principal and interest of any bonds issued for any of such purposes,
and for the purpose of creating reserves first to guarantee funds for
replacements and then for any of the purposes mentioned in this section, and
for no other purpose, there is hereby imposed a sanitary sewer use charge,
including, where appropriate, both a basic sewer use charge and a sewer use
surcharge, against each property served by the sanitary sewer system, or which
may otherwise discharge sewage, either directly or indirectly, into the sewer
system or any parts thereof or into any water or stream subject to the
jurisdiction of the city. The use charges, including the collection thereof,
shall be as provided in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 52-200)
§ 53.053 BILLING CYCLES FOR SEWER USE CHARGE.
   For the convenient and economical computation of the sanitary sewer charge
for all premises, the Manager shall divide the city into billing cycles in such
a manner as he or she shall determine, using January, February and March as a
base.
(Prior Code, § 52-201)
§ 53.054 COMPUTATION OF BASIC SEWER USE CHARGE.
   (A)   Each property using the sanitary sewer system of the city shall be
subject to a basic sewer use charge. For a given residential property, the
basic sewer use charge for each billing cycle shall be determined by
multiplying for each such cycle the total amount of water, in thousand gallons,
metered for the property during a billing cycle chosen from the most recent
past winter, by the basic sewer use unit charge. For a given non-residential
property, the basic sewer use charge for a given billing cycle shall be
determined by multiplying for the cycle the total amount of water or sewage, in
thousand gallons, measured for the property during the cycle, by the basic
sewer use unit charge. Upon approval of these rates by the City Council, the
rates shall be placed on file with the City Clerk.
   (B)   In the case of change of occupancy of residential property, the new
occupant shall be required to pay a sewer use charge based on the fee paid by
the previous occupant until the next review period. Upon approval of these
rates by the City Council, the rates shall be placed on file with the City
Clerk.
   (C)   Where a sewage flow meter or other sewage measuring device is required
or permitted by the Manager and is used to measure the volume of sewage
discharged into the sanitary sewer system, the sewer use charge shall be
computed thereon at the basic sewer use unit charge.
   (D)   The Manager shall review the basic sewer use unit charge every year,
or more often if conditions so warrant, and based upon the review shall make
recommendations to the City Council for its consideration.
(Prior Code, § 52-202)
§ 53.055 MINIMUM SEWER USE CHARGE.
   (A)   Regardless of whether a sewage meter is used, there shall be a minimum
sewer use charge per month to each property using the city sanitary sewer
system, determined by the number and size of the water meters serving the
property. The schedule of the sewer use charges is on file and available in the
city offices.
   (B)   If a customer can be provided adequate service with a smaller meter
and desires to have his or her existing meter replaced with a smaller meter,
the city shall make the requested change, provided that the customer installs
all necessary meter connections.
   (C)   Sewer use charges shall commence as of the date that the sanitary
sewer tap is made.
(Prior Code, § 52-203)
§ 53.056 APPLICABILITY OF SEWER USE SURCHARGE.
   In addition to the basic sewer use charge required by §
53.054, when any property discharges into the sanitary sewer system industrial
wastes or other high strength sewage, which sewage has a strength greater than
normal sewage, the property shall be subject to a sewer use surcharge, to be
determined as set forth in this chapter, the purpose of the surcharge being to
help defray the extra cost to the city of treating the sewage.
(Prior Code, § 52-204)
§ 53.057 DETERMINATION OF SEWER USE SURCHARGE.
   (A)   For use in determining the sewer use surcharge to be made against a
given property for a given period of time, the Manager shall sample and analyze
the sewage discharge from the property into the sanitary sewer system in order
to determine the strength of the sewage over the period. Usually samples shall
be taken from such sewage discharge on at least 3 composites during operations
on the property. The Manager shall annually determine the unit cost (dollars
per pound) to the city of removing suspended solids by dividing the city’s
annual operation and maintenance (including depreciation) sewage treatment
costs allocated to removing suspended solids by the total annual pounds of
suspended solids flowing into the city’s treatment facilities, shall annually
determine the unit cost to the city of removing biochemical oxygen demand (or
chemical oxygen demand) by dividing the city’s annual operation and maintenance
(including depreciation) sewage treatment costs allocated to removing
biochemical oxygen demand (or chemical oxygen demand) by the total annual
pounds of biochemical oxygen demand (or chemical oxygen demand) flowing into
the city’s treatment facilities, and shall annually determine the unit cost to
the city of removing other substances requiring treatment by dividing the
city’s annual operation and maintenance (including depreciation) sewage
treatment costs allocated to removing other substances requiring treatment by
the total annual pounds of such other substances requiring treatment flowing
into the city’s treatment facilities.
   (B)   It is hereby determined that the unit annual operation and maintenance
cost for treatment of biochemical oxygen demand shall be based upon the formula
set forth in §
53.058.
   (C)   The Manager shall review sewer use surcharge unit costs every year, or
more often if conditions so warrant, and, based upon the review, shall make
recommendations to the City Council for its consideration.
   (D)   All such sampling and analyzing of the sewer discharge from a given
property shall be in accordance with the provisions of §§
53.041 and
53.042; provided, however, that the Manager may, at his or her discretion,
accept the sampling and analyzing results as may be submitted to him or her by
the sewer user on the property if the Manager reasonably determines that the
results properly reflect the overall nature of the discharge.
   (E)   Each property for which more than 2 sampling stations are used shall
reimburse the city for the city’s sampling and analyzing costs resulting from
samples taken from more than 2 such stations.
(Prior Code, § 52-205)
§ 53.058 SEWER USE SURCHARGE FORMULA.
   (A)   At the approximate end of each month or quarter, or semiannually, the
Manager shall make a computation of the sewer use surcharge for each property
discharging high strength user’s waste, using the following formula:
SC = [Rp (Pi – Pn) + Rs (Si – Sn) + Rx (Xi – Xn)] x 8.34 x V
   (B)   Where:
      (1)   SC = Surcharge.
      (2)   Rp = Unit annual operation and maintenance costs for treatment of
BOD, COD.
      (3)   Pi = BOD, COD in the industrial waste, ppm.
      (4)   Pn = BOD, COD in normal sewage, ppm.
      (5)   Rs = Unit annual operation and maintenance costs of treatment of
suspended solids.
      (6)   Si = Suspended solids in the industrial waste, ppm.
      (7)   Sn = Suspended solids in normal sewage, ppm.
      (8)   Rx = Unit annual operation and maintenance costs for treatment of
any additional substance in the high strength user’s wastes.
      (9)   Xi = Substance requiring additional treatment in the industrial
waste, ppm.
      (10)   Xn = Substance requiring additional treatment in normal sewage,
ppm 8.34 = lb./million gallon-mg/1.
      (11)   V = Wastewater volume, million gallons.
(Prior Code, § 52-206)
§ 53.059 RATE FOR USERS HAVING PRIVATE WATER SUPPLY.
   Users of the sanitary sewage system of the city having a private water
supply which is discharged into such sanitary sewage system shall meter the
water supply at the user’s expense and be billed at the same rate as that
applied to like customers using the city water supply. Where, in the judgment
of the Manager, the meter requirements would be unreasonable under the
circumstances, a special rate may be established by the Manager which is
proportional to that rate charged similar users of the same user class and
based upon a reasonable estimate of such user’s quantity and strength of
discharge to the system.
(Prior Code, § 52-207)
§ 53.060 SEWAGE METERS.
   Subject to the approval of the Manager, any user of the city sanitary sewer
system may, at the user’s option and expense, install 1 or more sewage meters
or other sewage-measuring device to measure all sewage discharged into the
system; and, if required by the Manager, any user of the system shall install 1
or more meters or devices at the user’s expense. The Manager shall not require
the installation of sewage meters or other sewage-measuring devices if the
property is not discharging industrial wastes or other high strength sewage,
unless special or unusual conditions merit the making of such a requirement.
The Manager shall have the right to remove, repair and install any such
permitted or required meter or device at the meter owner’s expense.
(Prior Code, § 52-208)
§ 53.061 SPECIAL RATES.
   Where in the judgment of the Manager, by reason of special conditions, the
application of the use charges set forth in this chapter would be inequitable
or unfair to either the city or the user, or in cases where the character of
the sewage from a non-residential user is such that an additional burden is
placed upon the sewage system greater than that imposed by the average sewage
delivered to the sewage disposal plant, a special rate may be established by a
contract or by administrative rule or regulation with the approval of the
Mayor.
(Prior Code, § 52-209)
§ 53.062 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE FOR NON-PAYMENT OF CHARGES.
   If any sewer use charge is not paid within a period of 30 days after the
charge becomes due, the water may be turned off and the service not renewed
until all arrearages are paid, including a fee equivalent to a 1-hour charge at
the regular labor charge rate set by the city for the resumption of service.
(Prior Code, § 52-210)
§ 53.063 USE CHARGES TO CONSTITUTE LIEN.
   The sewer use charges provided for in this chapter, together with all other
charges and penalties, shall be and are hereby declared to be a lien upon the
property from the time such charge becomes due until paid, and may be collected
from either the owner or the person requesting the service, and may be
collected in the same manner as other city taxes are certified, assessed,
collected and returned.
(Prior Code, § 52-211)
§ 53.064 COMPUTATION OF CHARGES IN CASE OF DEFECTIVE METER.
   In any case where it has been impossible to read any water meter or sewage
meter or other measuring device, or if the Manager reasonably determines that
any such meter or device has failed to measure accurately during the billing
period in question, the sewer use charges shall be computed upon an estimated
water or sewage flow for the period, and the meter or device repaired and
tested at the expense of the meter owner.
(Prior Code, § 52-212)
§ 53.065 BILLING ADJUSTMENTS.
   Where, by reason of special or unusual conditions, the water consumption
fails to reflect properly the quantity of sewage actually discharged from a
property into the city sanitary sewer system, the Manager shall have the power
to adjust the billings.
(Prior Code, § 52-213)
§ 53.066 ADMINISTRATION OF CHAPTER.
   There is hereby created the city sanitary sewer system for the purpose of
performing the functions of sanitary sewage collection, treatment and disposal,
and charged with the administration of the provisions of this chapter, all
under the direction of the city. The personnel and facilities of the city water
system shall be utilized to bill and collect sewage use charges and to conduct
such other administrative and business affairs of the city sanitary sewer
system as the Manager may direct.
(Prior Code, § 52-214)
§ 53.067 BILLING PERIOD.
   The basic sewer use charges imposed by this chapter and the sewer use
surcharges imposed by this chapter shall be billed commencing on and after
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the
billings to be made monthly, quarterly or semiannually, as determined by the
Manager.
(Prior Code, § 52-215)
§ 53.068 INSTALLATION OF TAPS.
   Taps to all public, city or private sewers shall be made by the city. The
plumber or layer shall make application to the city’s Water Division, giving
the location by address and the approximate time the tap will be required.
Three working days will be considered the minimum time for notification to make
the tap.
(Prior Code, § 52-216)
§ 53.069 CONNECTION TO SEWER PRIOR TO ACCEPTANCE OF SEWER BY CITY.
   When a sewer connection is sought to be made before the sewer is fully
completed and accepted by the city, then, in such cases, the Plumbing Inspector
may issue a permit to make the connections when the party making application
for such connection shall have secured, in writing, the consent of the Public
Service Department and the contractor of the sewer to allow such a connection
to be made.
(Prior Code, § 52-217)
§ 53.070 TAP FEE.
   The tap fee for tapping a sanitary sewer shall be established by the city.
(Prior Code, § 52-218)
§ 53.071 LOCATION FOR PAYMENT OF TAP FEES AND OTHER CHARGES.
   Any necessary charges or tap fees established by this chapter shall be
payable at the offices of the city’s Light and Power Department during normal
business hours.
(Prior Code, § 52-219)
§ 53.072 TIME LIMIT FOR INSTALLING TAP AFTER MAKING APPLICATION.
   If any tap is not made within 6 months from the date of application, the
application shall become null and void, unless the applicant notifies the city
before the expiration of the 6-month period after the application date.
(Prior Code, § 52-220)
§ 53.073 SEWER ASSESSMENT; INSTALLATION AND OWNERSHIP OF MAINS.
   (A)   Where the property with which sewer connection is sought to be made is
not within the bounds of a regular sanitary sewer district, or where such
property has not been assessed, or has not paid for the construction of the
sewer to which connection is sought to be made, then, in such case, the city’s
Sewer Division shall not accept a tap application for the sewer connection
until an amount shall have been paid to the Sewer Division in an amount
equivalent to the front footage charge for the number of front feet or an
equivalent square footage charge for the number of square feet of the entire
property with which the connection is sought to be made.
   (B)   The equivalent front footage charge or equivalent square footage
charge shall be the average unit amount as assessed per front foot or per
square foot on the most current sewer districts and be no less than the
appropriate costs of the main connected to, and shall be determined by the
Manager.
   (C)   Mains may be installed by either the Sewer Department or by private
contractor under the direction of the City Engineer. After inspection and
acceptance by the City Engineer, the mains within the corporate limits or
zoning area and located within the boundaries of a dedicated street, alley or
easement, when used for the city sewer collection system, shall be the property
of the city.
(Prior Code, § 52-221)
§ 53.074 REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF SERVICE LINES.
   (A)   Duty of property owner. The city’s Sewer Department may require the
owner of any property which is within the city and connected to the public
sewers or drains to repair or replace any connection line which serves the
owner’s property and is broken, clogged or otherwise in need of repair or

ILLICIT DISCHARGE TO STORM SEWER SYSTEM
§ 53.100 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The U.S. EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(“NPES”) permit program (Program) administered by the Nebraska Department of
Environmental Quality (“NDEQ”) requires that cities meeting certain demographic
and environmental impact criteria obtain from the NDEQ an NPDES permit for the
discharge of storm water from a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)(MS4
Permit). The City of North Platte (City) is subject to the program and is
required to obtain, and has obtained an MS4 permit; the city's MS4 permit is on
file at the office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection
during regular office hours.
   (B)   As a condition of the city's MS4 permit, the city is obliged to adopt
and enforce an illicit discharge to storm sewer system ordinance.
   (C)   No state or federal funds have been made available to assist the city
in administering and enforcing the program. Accordingly, the city shall fund
its operations under this subchapter entirely by charges imposed on the owners
of properties which are made subject to the program by virtue of state and
federal law, and/or other sources of funding, if any, established by a separate
ordinance.
   (D)   Terms used in this subchapter shall have the meanings specified in the
program.
(Ord. 3705, § 1, 9-4-2007)
§ 53.101 ILLICIT DISCHARGES PROHIBITED.
   (A)   For purposes of this subchapter, a “responsible party” is 1 or more
persons that control or are in possession of or own property. Responsible
parties shall be jointly and severally responsible for compliance with this
subchapter and jointly and severally liable for any illicit discharge from the
property controlled, possessed or owned. For purposes of this subchapter,
“property” includes but is not limited to real estate, fixtures, facilities and
premises of any kind located upon, under or above the surface of real estate.
   (B)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to relieve a responsible
party subject to an NDEQ-issued industrial discharge permit or any other
federal, state or city permit, statute, ordinance or rule from any obligation
imposed by such permit, statute, ordinance or rule if any such obligation is
greater than any obligation imposed by this subchapter.
   (C)   Any discharge into the city's storm sewer system prohibited by the
city's MS4 permit, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference,
shall be deemed an “illicit discharge” in violation of this subchapter.
   (D)   Sediment pollution originating from excessive erosion rates on a
construction site not otherwise subject to city ordinance or sediment pollution
entering a municipal storm sewer that causes a water quality violation as
determined by the NDEQ shall be deemed an illicit discharge in violation of
this subchapter.
(Ord. 3705, § 1, 9-4-2007) Penalty, see §
53.999
§ 53.102 ILLICIT CONNECTIONS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   For purposes of this subchapter, an illicit connection to the city's
storm sewer system is any physical connection or other topographical or other
condition, natural or artificial, which is not specifically authorized by
ordinance or written rule of the city, which causes or facilitates, directly or
indirectly, an illicit discharge.
   (B)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of any
illicit connection shall constitute a violation of this subchapter.
   (C)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
(Ord. 3705, § 1, 9-4-2007) Penalty, see §
53.999
§ 53.103 INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Any responsible party subject to an industrial NPDES discharge permit
issued by the NDEQ shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
   (B)   Proof of compliance with the permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the enforcement officer prior to discharges to the storm sewer
system authorized by the permit.
(Ord. 3705, § 1, 9-4-2007)
§ 53.104 DETECTION, REPORTING AND COST RECOVERY.
   (A)   All detection activities permitted under this subchapter shall be
conducted by the City Engineer, or his or her designee, hereinbefore and after
referred to as the Enforcement Officer.
   (B)   The city shall not be responsible for the direct or indirect
consequences to persons or property of an illicit discharge, or circumstances
which may cause an illicit discharge, undetected by the city.
   (C)   Every responsible party has an absolute duty to monitor conditions on
property owned or controlled by them, to prevent all illicit discharges, and to
report to the Enforcement Officer illicit discharges which the responsible
party knows or should have known to have occurred. Failure to comply with any
provision of this chapter is a violation of this chapter.
      (1)   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any
responsible party has information of any known or suspected illicit discharge,
the responsible party shall immediately take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such discharge at the responsible
party's sole cost.
      (2)   If the illicit discharge consists of hazardous materials, the
responsible party shall also immediately notify emergency response agencies of
the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.
      (3)   If the illicit discharge emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an
on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least 3 years.
      (4)   A report of an illicit discharge shall be made in person or by
phone or facsimile or email to the Enforcement Officer immediately but in any
event within 24 hours of the illicit discharge; notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed or emailed to
the Enforcement Officer within 24 hours of the personal or phone notice.
   (D)   Any person or entity shall also report to the city any illicit
discharge or circumstances which such person or entity reasonably believes pose
a risk of an illicit discharge.
   (E)   Upon receiving a report pursuant to the previous subsections, or
otherwise coming into possession of information indicating an actual or
imminent illicit discharge, the Enforcement Officer shall conduct an inspection
of the site as soon as reasonably possible and thereafter shall provide to the
responsible party, and any third party reporter, a written report of the
conditions which may cause or which have already caused an illicit discharge.
The responsible party shall immediately commence corrective action or
remediation and shall complete such corrective action or remediation within 24
hours.
   (F)   The Enforcement Officer shall be permitted to enter and inspect
property subject to regulation under this section as often as is necessary to
determine compliance with this section. If a responsible party has security
measures that require identification and clearance before entry to its property
or premises, the responsible party shall make the necessary arrangements to
allow access by the Enforcement Officer. By way of specification but not
limitation:
      (1)   A responsible party shall allow the Enforcement Officer ready
access to all parts of the property for purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records related to a suspected, actual, or imminent
illicit discharge, and for the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (2)   The Enforcement Officer shall have the right to set up on any
property such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Enforcement
Officer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling related to a suspected, actual or
imminent illicit discharge.
      (3)   The Enforcement Officer shall have the right to require any
responsible party, at responsible party's sole expense, to install monitoring
equipment and deliver monitoring data or reports to the Enforcement Officer as
the Enforcement Officer directs. The sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
responsible party at responsible party's sole expense. All devices shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
property to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
responsible party at the written or oral order of the Enforcement Officer and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
responsible party.
      (5)   Refusing to allow the Enforcement Officer access to a property is a
violation of this subchapter.
      (6)   If the Enforcement Officer has been refused access to any part of
the property from an illicit connection and/or illicit discharge to a municipal
storm sewer is occurring, suspected or imminent, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this subchapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the enforcement officer may seek issuance of a
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (G)   If it is determined that an illicit discharge is imminent or has
occurred, the actual administrative costs incurred by the city in the
enforcement of this subchapter shall be recovered from the responsible party.
The Enforcement Officer shall submit an invoice to the responsible party
reflecting the actual costs and wages and expenses incurred by the city for the
enforcement activities undertaken. Failure to pay charges invoiced under this
subchapter within 30 days of billing shall constitute a violation of this
subchapter.
(Ord. 3705, § 1, 9-4-2007) Penalty, see §
53.999
§ 53.105 ACCESS; SUSPENSION OF.
   (A)   Emergency suspension. The Enforcement Officer may, without prior
notice, suspend storm sewer system access to a property when such emergency
suspension is necessary to stop an ongoing or imminent illicit discharge. If
the responsible party fails to immediately comply with an emergency suspension
order, the Enforcement Officer shall take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize the illicit discharge. All costs of such action shall be
recovered from the responsible party for the property identified as the source
of the illicit discharge.
   (B)   Non-emergency suspension. If the Enforcement Officer detects or is
informed of circumstances which could cause an illicit discharge but such
illicit discharge is not ongoing or imminent, and if the suspension of storm
sewer system access would reasonably be expected to prevent or reduce the
potential illicit discharge, the Enforcement Officer shall notify the
responsible party of the proposed suspension of storm sewer system access and
the time and date of such suspension. Notice to one responsible party for the
property shall be sufficient notice to all. Remediation of the circumstances
shall avoid a violation of this subchapter provided that no illicit discharge
occurs. In the alternative, the responsible party may request a meeting with
the Enforcement Officer for the purpose of presenting information which the
responsible party believes will show that remediation is unnecessary, and if
the Enforcement Officer finds such information is satisfactory, the Enforcement
Officer may rescind or modify the notice of suspension. If the Enforcement
Officer finds such information unsatisfactory, the Enforcement Officer shall
issue a final written order of suspension including the date and time of
suspension and the order may be appealed as provided hereinafter. Any physical
action to reinstate storm sewer system access to property subject to such order
prior to obtaining a court order of relief shall be deemed a violation of this
subchapter. An order of suspension shall not preclude charging the responsible
party with a municipal infraction as provided hereinafter or taking any other
enforcement action permitted by statute or ordinance.

53.999
§ 53.106 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property below the elevation of the 100-year flood elevation as determined
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, free of trash, debris, grass
clippings or other organic wastes and other obstacles that would pollute,
contaminate, or significantly alter the quality of water flowing through the
watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing
privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such
structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity
of the watercourse.

the expiration of 10 days after the date of impoundment, an amount sufficient
to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for the animal,
including estimated medical care, for 30 days, inclusive of the date on which
the animal was impounded. If such payment is not made prior to expiration of
this 10-day period, the animal shall become the property of the city to be
disposed of as the city deems appropriate. Such payment will be required for
each succeeding 30-day period. If any such payment is not made prior to the end
of each succeeding 30-day period, the animal shall become the property of the
city to be disposed of as the city deems appropriate. The amount of the payment
shall be determined by the city based on the current rate for board at the
animal shelter and the condition of the animal after examination of the animal
by a veterinarian acting for the city. Any such payment received by the city in
excess of the amount determined by the city to be due for the board and care of
the animal shall be refunded by the city upon expiration of the order of
impoundment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the owner or custodian is found
not guilty of animal neglect or cruelty, the owner or custodian shall only be
required to pay the veterinary expenses and one-half of the board and care fees
determined by the city to be due.
   (G)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined by a veterinarian
acting for the city that such animal is diseased or disabled beyond any useful
purpose, the animal shall immediately become the property of the city to be
humanely disposed of as the city deems appropriate.

§ 90.18 DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED ANIMALS.
   (A)   Holding period. Impounded animals which are not claimed by their owner

In such instance the time period shall not apply and the animal will be

      (3)   When an animal has previously been kept for a minimum of 3 days by

animal shall be disposed of in a humane manner by the Animal Control Division.
   (C)   Unlawful disposal. No Animal Control Officer shall dispose of any
captured or impounded animal except through the procedures provided for by this
chapter. No Animal Control Officer shall hold a commercial animal establishment
permit.
   (D)   Adoption. The city may, in lieu of having an unclaimed animal killed
as provided in this section, give the animal into the custody of any adult
requesting adoption of a specific animal as a pet after viewing it, providing
that the person agrees that he or she will humanely care for such animal and
will not permit its use for breeding, guard, laboratory, experimental or
illegal purposes. No animal shall be so adopted until after such time as
arrangements are made, satisfactory to an Animal Control Officer, for the
spaying or neutering of the animal if the animal is of an age and condition
that spaying or neutering can be performed safely on the animal. Failure to
spay or neuter pursuant to the requirements of this division shall constitute a
violation punishable as a Classification I violation of §
90.99, and the Court shall, in addition to the fine, direct that the animal be
spayed or neutered.
   (E)   Impoundment fee and boarding fee. An impoundment fee shall be charged
when any animal is picked up by an officer of the city, or an agent thereof,
and transported to the animal shelter or other city-designated place of

impoundment shall be at a rate for each day or portion of a day that the dog or
cat is impounded, provided that the dog or cat is impounded for less than 6
consecutive days or portions thereof. If a dog or cat is impounded for more
than 5 consecutive days or portions thereof, the fee for the care during the
period of impoundment shall be at a rate for each day, or portion thereof, of
impoundment. The fee shall be increased by the actual amount of any unusual
expenses incurred either in the impoundment or the care of the animal. An owner
or keeper must pay these fees in full to obtain custody of his or her animal,

household.
   (F)   Surrender fee. Animals impounded which come from outside the city
limits shall be paid for by the owner, keeper or harborer of the animal or by
the political entity from which the animal originated. In the case of voluntary
surrender of an animal, as described in divisions (A)(1) or (3) of this
section, the owner, keeper or harborer who resides outside the city limits
shall pay a surrender fee, in an amount as established by resolution of the
Council, for each occurrence of surrender. A resident of the city shall pay no
fee in the case of voluntary surrender as provided for in division (A)(1) of
this section. Except for animals voluntarily surrendered as provided for in
divisions (A)(1) and (3) of this section, for each animal which is impounded

      (1)   Any bite or wound exposing an individual to the possibility of
rabies or other zoonotic disease (referred to in this division as an
“incident”) shall be immediately reported to the police by the victim, and by
the owner, keeper or harborer of the dog or cat if the incident is known to him
or her. Any such dog or cat bite which requires medical treatment shall be
reported within 24 hours to the Police Department by the treating physician or
hospital caring for the patient.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of every owner or keeper of any dog or cat,
upon receiving notice or having knowledge of the involvement of his or her pet
in a human exposure to the possibility of rabies or other zoonotic disease by
biting, to immediately place the animal in a duly licensed veterinary medical
facility, the address of which must be furnished to the city’s animal shelter,
where the animal shall be isolated and confined for observation for 10
consecutive days from and including the date of the incident. It shall be
unlawful for the owner, keeper or person harboring the animal involved in the
incident to release it from his or her custody or to hide or conceal the animal
or to take or allow the animal to be taken beyond the limits of the city,
unless as authorized by the Police Department or court, until the period of
confinement and observation required in this division is completed. The owner
or keeper of the animal involved in an incident shall be liable for the costs
of confinement and observation. The death of the dog or cat or any suspicious
change in the health or behavior of any such dog or cat undergoing observation
shall be reported as soon as possible by the observing authority to the Police
Department or its designate. The Police Department or its designate is hereby
authorized to authorize confinement other than described in this division as it
finds medically appropriate, providing the animal will be controlled and
observed in accordance with the owner’s signed agreement, but only if the dog
or cat has been vaccinated for prevention of rabies and is duly licensed as
provided by this chapter. Unless determined otherwise by the Police Department,
an exception to the confinement required by this division may be granted in the
following case: where a female dog is nursing unweaned puppies or a female cat
is nursing unweaned kittens.
   (B)   Bites by animals other than dogs and cats. Any bite which would, by
other than a dog or cat, expose an individual to the possibility of rabies or
other zoonotic disease (referred to in this division as an “incident”) shall be
immediately reported to the police by the victim, and by the owner, keeper or
harborer of the animal if the incident is known to him or her. Any animal bite
which requires medical treatment shall be reported within 24 hours to the
Police Department by the treating physician or hospital caring for the patient.
It shall be unlawful for the owner, keeper or person harboring the animal
involved in the incident to release it from his or her custody or to hide or
conceal the animal or to take or allow the animal to be taken beyond the limits
of the city unless so authorized by the Chief of Police until an observation
period stipulated by the Chief of Police for the particular species of animal
is over or the period is ruled unnecessary by the Chief of Police. It shall be
the duty of each owner or keeper, upon receiving notice of an incident, to
immediately place the animal involved in a duly licensed veterinary medical
facility, the address of which must be furnished to the Police Department at
once, or in the city’s animal shelter, where the animal shall be isolated and
confined for observation. The owner or keeper of an animal involved in a biting
incident shall be liable for the cost of confinement and observation. The death
of any such animal or any suspicious change in the health or behavior of any
such animal undergoing observation shall be reported immediately by the
observing authority to the Chief of Police or his or her designated
representative. If a proper period of observation is undetermined or
undeterminable for the species of animal involved in an incident, the city is
hereby empowered to order whatever laboratory examination of the animal or
animal’s tissues is required by prudent medical practice for the protection of
the victim, and no liability for damages shall arise from any injury to or
death of the animal occasioned by the laboratory examination. When an animal
involved in an incident is outside the city, the city shall forward information
concerning the incident to the appropriate authority of the jurisdiction of
residence of the owner, keeper or harborer or the appropriate state health
department for coordinated disease prevention.
   (C)   Authority to kill animals that cannot be safely captured; delivery of
remains to Police Department. If any dangerous, fierce or vicious dog, cat or
other animal believed involved in an incident (as the term “incident” is used
in divisions (A) and (B) of this section) cannot be safely captured or
prevented from escaping by usual means, the animal may be slain by an officer.
In all cases where the animal may have exposed a person to rabies and is slain
before the completion of the observation period stipulated for the species by
the city, it shall be the duty of the person slaying the animal to forthwith
deliver, or cause to be delivered, all the remains of the animal, including the
undamaged head, to the Police Department. A departure from this procedure must
be requested of an authorized person by the city.
   (D)   Impoundment and observation of animals in transit through city. For
the purpose of disease or injury control, the city is hereby empowered to
impound and observe animals in transit through the city at the request of any
official animal control agency, health officer or law enforcement agency of
another jurisdiction.
   (E)   Declaration of disease control emergency. If Chief of Police
determines that a rabies or other zoonotic disease control emergency exists, he
or she shall so declare, stating the boundaries of the affected area, and he or
she is hereby empowered to issue emergency regulations and take all necessary
steps within the provisions of this chapter and state law to abate the threat.
The emergency steps and regulations shall be in effect only during the period
of the declared emergency.
   (F)   Removal of animal droppings. The owner or keeper of every animal, when
the animal is off the property controlled by the owner or keeper, shall be
responsible for the removal of any fecal material before taking an animal from
the immediate area where the excretion occurred. Failure to remove the fecal
material shall result in a violation of this division. Any person who violates
this division shall be punished as provided for in §
90.99(A)(1).
   (G)   Disposal of dead animals.
      (1)   The Police Department or its authorized agent shall be responsible
for the removal of all dead animals found within the city, except as otherwise
provided in this section. As used in this section, the term DEAD ANIMAL shall
mean one not killed for food or no longer fit for food. The actual cost of the
removal shall be paid by the owner.
      (2)   All large dead animals shall be removed and legally disposed of by
the owner or proprietor of the premises within 12 hours after the death of the
animal. If not so removed, the animal shall be removed at actual cost to the
property owner or proprietor.
      (3)   On occupied property, the owner or the tenant thereof shall provide
easy access to the subject animal for purposes of its removal. No person owning
or having in his or her possession the carcass of any animal not to be used for
food shall permit the carcass to remain in or upon any street, sidewalk, park,
public ground, private lot or other place without at once giving notice to the
Chief of Police.

authorized agent, lessee or tenant of real estate in the city frequented by
squirrels, starlings or pigeons in numbers the city believes to be sufficient
to create a public nuisance on the real estate. In cases where the public
nuisance exists in a district of the city, the permit may be issued to a duly
licensed pest control or exterminating company for the district, which shall be
defined on the permit. No permit shall be issued for a longer period than 30
days. Retention of any such permit shall be conditioned upon continued
compliance with advisory instructions issued and regulations adopted by the
city dealing with such activity, which regulations the city is hereby
authorized and directed to promulgate and to adopt by filing the regulations
with the city. The regulations shall govern the elimination and disposal of
squirrels, starlings and pigeons and shall be designed to ensure humane and
sanitary methods for the elimination and disposal and for the protection of

rabies vaccination or to violate any of the provisions or requirements of this
section. Failure of a owner of a dog or cat to present to an officer, upon
demand, the valid rabies vaccination certificate and valid rabies vaccination
tag shall constitute prima facie evidence in the appropriate court of law that

such contributions until the Internal Revenue Service or the federal courts
rule that, pursuant to § 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, the contributions

contribution paid directly to the retirement system.
   (C)   Each firefighter participating in the retirement system shall be
entitled to make voluntary cash contributions to the retirement system in an
amount not to exceed the contribution limitations established by the Internal
Revenue Code. Voluntary contributions shall be credited to the employee account

employee’s contributions, without interest, that were made to the city prior to
January 1, 1984, with the contribution to be made at the time the firefighter
retires or terminates employment with the city. The city may contribute the
amount before the firefighter’s retirement or termination of employment or
credit interest on the contribution.
   (B)   Each such city shall contribute any additional amounts necessary to
fund retirement or other retirement plan benefits not provided by employee
contributions or city contributions to the employer account required by
division (A) above. Additional contributions shall be accumulated in an
unallocated employer account of the Firefighters Retirement System Fund and
used to provide the benefits, if any, specified in §§

§ 94.136 RETIRING FIREFIGHTER; ANNUITY OPTIONS; LUMP-SUM PAYMENT.
   (A)   At any time before the retirement date, the retiring firefighter may
elect to receive his or her pension benefit at retirement either in the form of
a straight life annuity or any optional form of annuity benefit established by
the Retirement Committee and provided under a purchased annuity contract. The
optional annuity benefit shall be specified in the funding medium for the
retirement system and shall include a straight life annuity with a guarantee of
at least 60 monthly payments or an annuity payable for the life of the retiring
firefighter and, after the death of the retiree, monthly payments, as elected
by the retiring firefighter, of 100%, 75% or 50% of the amount of annuity
payable to the retiring firefighter during his or her life, to the beneficiary
selected by the retiring firefighter at the time of the original application
for an annuity. For any firefighter whose retirement date is on or after
January 1, 1997, the optional benefit forms for the retirement system shall
include a single lump-sum payment of the firefighter’s retirement value. For
firefighters whose retirement date is prior to January 1, 1997, a single lump-
sum payment shall be available only if the city has adopted the distribution
option in the funding medium established for the retirement system. The
retiring firefighter may further elect to defer the date of the first payment
or lump-sum distribution to the first day of any specified month prior to age
70. In the event the retiring firefighter elects to receive his or her pension
benefit in the form of an annuity, the amount of such annuity benefit shall be
the amount provided by the annuity contract purchased or otherwise provided by
the firefighter’s retirement value as of the date of the first payment. Any
such annuity contract purchased by the retirement system may be distributed to
the retiring firefighter. Upon the payment of a lump-sum or the distribution of
a paid-up annuity contract, all obligations of the retirement system to pay
retirement benefits to the firefighter and his or her beneficiaries shall
terminate, without exception.
   (B)   (1)   For all firefighters employed on January 1, 1984, the amount of
the pension benefit at the retirement date shall not be less than the following
amounts:
         (a)   If retirement from the city occurs following age 55 with 21
years of service with the city, 50% of regular pay;
         (b)   If retirement from the city occurs following age 50 but before
age 55 with at least 21 years of service with the city, the firefighter shall
receive the actuarial equivalent of the benefit which would otherwise be
provided at age 55;
         (c)   If retirement from the city occurs on or after age 55 with less
than 21 years of service with the city, the firefighter shall receive a pension
of at least 50% of the salary he or she was receiving at the time of retirement
multiplied by the ratio of the years of service to 21;
         (d)   For terminations of employment from the city on or after
September 9, 1993, if the termination of employment as a firefighter occurs
before age 55 but after completion of 21 years of service with the city, the
firefighter shall receive upon the attainment of age 55 a pension benefit of
50% of regular pay;
         (e)   Unless an optional annuity benefit is selected by the retired
firefighter, at the death of any retired firefighter the same rate of pension
as is provided for in this section shall be paid to the surviving spouse of the
deceased firefighter during such time as the surviving spouse remains unmarried
and, in case there is no surviving spouse, then the minor children, if any, of
the deceased firefighter shall equally share the pension benefit during their
minority, except that as soon as a child of the deceased firefighter ceases to
be a minor, the pension as to the child shall cease; or
         (f)   In the event a retired firefighter or his or her surviving
beneficiaries die before the aggregate amount of pension payments received by
the firefighter and his or her survivor beneficiaries, if any, equals the total
amount in the firefighter’s employee account, at the time of the first benefit
payment the difference between the total amount in the employee’s account and
the aggregate amount of pension payments received by the retired firefighter
and his or her surviving beneficiaries, if any, shall be paid in a single sum
to the firefighter’s estate.
      (2)   A firefighter entitled to a minimum pension benefit under this
division may elect to receive the pension benefit in any form permitted by
division (A) of this section, including a single lump-sum payment if the
firefighter retires on or after January 1, 1997, or if the city has adopted a
lump-sum distribution option for firefighters retiring before January 1, 1997,
in the funding medium for the retirement system. If the minimum pension benefit
is paid in the form of an optional annuity benefit or a single lump-sum
payment, the benefit or payment shall be the actuarial equivalent of the
annuity that would otherwise be paid to the firefighter pursuant to this
division.
      (3)   If the firefighter chooses the single lump-sum payment option, the
firefighter may request that the actuarial equivalent be equal to the average
of the cost of 2 annuity contracts purchased on the open market, if the
difference between the cost of the 2 annuity contracts does not exceed 5%. Of
the 2 annuity contracts used for comparison, 1 shall be chosen by the
firefighter and 1 shall be chosen by the city. If the difference between the 2
annuity contracts exceeds 5%, the Retirement Committee shall review the costs
of the 2 annuity contracts and make a recommendation to the City Council as to
the amount of the lump-sum payment to be made to the firefighter. The City
Council shall, after a hearing, determine the amount of the single lump-sum
payment due the firefighter.
   (C)   If the retirement value of a firefighter entitled to a minimum pension
benefit under division (B) of this section is not sufficient at the time of the
first payment to purchase or provide the required pension benefit, the city
shall utilize the funds as may be necessary from the unallocated employer
account of the retirement system to purchase or provide for the required
pension benefit.
   (D)   Any retiring firefighter whose pension benefit is less than $25 per
month on the straight life annuity option shall be paid a lump-sum settlement
equal to the retirement value in lieu of annuity and shall not be entitled to
elect to receive annuity benefits.

participating in the retirement system dies other than in the line of duty, and
except as provided in division (B) of this section, the entire retirement value
shall be payable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries specified by the deceased
firefighter prior to his or her death or to the deceased firefighter’s estate
in the event that no beneficiary was specified. The retirement value or portion
thereof may be received by the beneficiary in the form of a single lump-sum
payment, a straight life annuity, or any other optional form of benefit
specified in the retirement system’s funding medium. In the event benefits are
paid in the form of an annuity, the annuity shall be the amount provided by the
annuity contract purchased or otherwise provided by the amount of retirement
value to be paid to the beneficiary as of the date of the first payment. Upon
the payment of a lump-sum distribution or the purchase and distribution of the
annuity contract to the beneficiary, all obligations of the retirement system
to the beneficiary shall terminate, without exception.
   (B)   If any firefighter employed by such city as a member of its paid Fire
Department on January 1, 1984, and any firefighter reemployed thereafter who,
while employed in such Department entered military service and is still in
military service, dies while employed by the city as a firefighter other than
in the line of duty after becoming 50 years of age and before electing to
retire, and after serving in the paid Fire Department of the city for at least
21 years, then a pension of at least 25% of his or her regular pay, as defined
in §
94.131, in the form of a straight life annuity, shall be paid to the surviving
spouse or minor children of the deceased firefighter. If the deceased
firefighter is not survived by a spouse or in the event the surviving spouse
dies before the minor children of the firefighter attain the age of majority,
the pension benefit shall be paid to the firefighter’s minor children until
they have attained the age of majority. Each such child shall share equally in
the total pension benefit to the age of majority, except that as soon as a
child attains the age of majority, the pension benefit to the child shall cease

payable under this division exceeds the retirement value at the time of the
first payment, the city shall utilize such funds as may be necessary from the
unallocated employer account of the retirement system to purchase or provide
for the required pension benefit. In the event a deceased firefighter described

death benefits shall be provided under the provisions of division (A) of this
section as if the firefighter were not employed by the city on January 1, 1984.
   (D)   In the event the surviving spouse or minor children of the deceased
firefighter die before the aggregate amount of pension payments received by the
firefighter and his or her survivor beneficiaries, if any, equals the total
amount in the firefighter’s employee account at the time of the first benefit
payment, the difference between such total amount in the employee’s account and
the aggregate amount of pension payments received by the retired firefighter
and his or her surviving beneficiaries, if any, shall be paid in a single sum
to the firefighter’s beneficiary, or in the absence of a surviving beneficiary,
his or her estate.
   (E)   To the extent that the retirement value at the date of death exceeds
the amount required to purchase or provide the specified pension under division
(B) of this section, the excess shall be paid in the manner provided in
division (A) of this section.
   (F)   Any payments for the benefit of a minor child shall be made on behalf
of the child to the surviving spouse or, if there is none, to the legal
guardian of the child.

participating in the retirement system dies in the line of duty or in case
death is caused by or is the result of injuries received while in the line of
duty and such firefighter is not survived by a spouse or minor children, the
entire retirement value shall be payable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries

deceased firefighter’s estate in the event that no beneficiary was specified.
The retirement value or portion thereof may be paid in the form of a single

age of majority, except that as soon as a child attains the age of majority,
the pension benefit to the child shall cease and be reallocated among the
remaining minor children until the last remaining child dies or reaches the age
of majority.

of the child to the surviving spouse or, if there is none, to the legal
guardian of the child.
   (C)   In the event the surviving spouse or minor children of the deceased
firefighter die before the aggregate amount of pension payments received by the
firefighter and his or her survivor beneficiaries, if any, equals the total
amount in the firefighter’s employee account at the time of the first benefit

§ 94.140 DISABILITY IN THE LINE OF DUTY; DISABILITY BENEFIT; RETURN TO DUTY;
CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (C) of this section for temporary
disability, if any firefighter becomes disabled, the firefighter shall be
placed upon the roll of pensioned firefighters at the regular retirement
pension of 50% of regular pay for the period of the disability. For purposes of
this section, DISABILITY shall mean the complete inability of the firefighter,
for reasons of accident or other cause while in the line of duty, to perform
the duties of a firefighter, as defined by Fire Department job descriptions or
ordinance.
   (B)   No disability benefit payment shall be made except upon adequate proof
furnished to the city, consisting of a medical examination conducted by a
competent, disinterested physician who is duly licensed to practice medicine
and surgery in this state and who certifies to the city that the firefighter is
unable to perform the duties of a firefighter. The city, during the first 3
years of the payment of the benefits, shall have the right, at reasonable
times, to require the disabled firefighter to undergo a medical examination at
the city’s expense to determine the continuance of the disability claimed.
After the 3-year period, the city may request the district court to order the
firefighter to submit proof of the continuance of the disability claimed if the
city has reasonable grounds to believe the firefighter is fraudulently
receiving disability payments. The city shall have the right to demand a
physical examination of the firefighter by a competent disinterested physician
who is duly licensed to practice medicine and surgery in this state and who is
chosen by the city. The expense of the examination shall be borne by the city.
   (C)   In case of temporary disability of a firefighter received while in the
line of duty, he or she shall receive his or her salary during the continuance
of the disability for a period not to exceed 12 months, except that if it is
ascertained by the city within 12 months that such temporary disability has
become a disability as defined in this section, then the salary shall cease and
he shall be entitled to the benefits for pensions in case of disability as
provided in this section.
   (D)   (1)   All payments of pension or salary provided by this section shall
be subject to deduction of amounts paid under the state’s Workers’ Compensation
Act. Total payments to a disabled firefighter, in excess of amounts paid as
workers’ compensation benefits, shall not be less than the retirement value at
the date of disability.
      (2)   If the actuarial equivalent of the disability pension payable under
this section exceeds the firefighter’s retirement value at the time of the
first payment, the city shall contribute additional amounts as may be
necessary, from time to time, to provide for the required disability pension.
   (E)   If a firefighter who was receiving a pension under this section is
later determined to be no longer disabled, the pension provided for under this
section shall terminate and the firefighter’s vested retirement value, as
reduced by any disability payments made from the retirement system, shall
thereafter be held and administered in the same manner as for any non-disabled
firefighter or former firefighter.
   (F)   If a firefighter who was receiving a pension under this section is
later determined to be no longer disabled during the first 3 years when
disability benefit payments are being paid, the firefighter may return to duty
with the Fire Department under the following conditions:
      (1)   If a vacancy exists on the Fire Department for which the
firefighter is qualified and the firefighter wishes to return to the Fire
Department, the city shall hire the firefighter to fill the vacancy at a pay
grade of not less than his or her previous pay grade; or
      (2)   If no vacancy exists in the Fire Department and the firefighter
wishes to return to the Fire Department, the city shall place the firefighter
on a waiting list and rehire the firefighter at a pay grade of not less than
his or her previous pay grade when a vacancy occurs for which the firefighter
is qualified.
   (G)   The provisions of this division shall not apply to a firefighter whose
disability benefit payments are terminated because of fraud on the part of the
firefighter.

Ch. 48, Art. 1. All state worker’s compensation benefits shall be payable in
full to such firefighter as provided in Neb. RS Ch. 48, Art. 1, but all amounts
paid by the city or its insurer under §§
94.130 to
94.147 to any disabled firefighter entitled to receive a salary during the
disability shall be considered as payments on account of the salary and shall
be credited thereon. The remaining balance of the salary, if any, shall be
payable as otherwise provided in §§

§ 94.142 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT; BENEFITS; HOW TREATED; VESTING SCHEDULE.
   (A)   In the event a firefighter quits or is discharged before his or her
retirement date as defined in §
94.137(C), the firefighter may request and receive, as a lump-sum payment, an
amount equal to the value of his or her employee account as determined at the
valuation date preceding his or her termination of employment. The firefighter,
if vested, may, in lieu thereof, receive a deferred pension benefit or lump-sum
benefit in an amount purchased or provided by the vested retirement value at
the date of retirement. The retirement value at such retirement date shall
consist of the then accumulated value of the firefighter’s employee account at
the date of the retirement as reduced by any lump-sum distributions received
prior to retirement, together with a vested percentage of the accumulated value
of the firefighter’s employer account at the date of retirement. The vesting
schedule shall be as follows:
      (1)   If the terminating firefighter has been a member of the system for
less than 4 years, the vesting percentage shall be 0; and
      (2)   If the terminating firefighter has been a member of the paid
Department of the city for at least 4 years, the vesting percentage shall be
40%. The vesting percentage shall be 60% after 5 years, 80% after 6 years and
100% after 7 years.
   (B)   The deferred pension benefit shall be payable on the first of the
month immediately following the terminating firefighter’s 55 birthday. At the
option of the firefighter, the pension benefit may be paid
as of the first of the month after he or she attains the age of 50. The
election may be made by the firefighter any time prior to the payment of the
pension benefits.
   (C)   The deferred pension benefit shall be paid in the optional benefit
forms specified at §
94.136(A) as elected by the firefighter. Notwithstanding anything in this
subchapter to the contrary, if the firefighter’s vested retirement value at the
date of his or her termination of employment is less than $3,500, the
firefighter shall, upon request within 1 year of the termination, be paid his
or her vested retirement value in the form of a single lump-sum payment.
   (D)   Effective January 1, 1997, a firefighter may elect, upon his or her
termination of employment, to receive his or her vested retirement value in the
form of a single lump-sum payment. For a firefighter whose termination of
employment is prior to January 1, 1997, this election shall be available only
if the city has adopted a lump-sum distribution option for terminating
firefighters in the funding medium established for the retirement system.
   (E)   Upon any lump-sum payment of a terminating firefighter’s retirement
value under this section, the firefighter will not be entitled to any deferred
pension benefit and the city and the retirement system shall have no further
obligation to pay such firefighter or his or her beneficiaries any benefits
under this subchapter.
   (F)   In the event that the terminating firefighter is not credited with
100% of his or her employer account, the remaining non-vested portion of the
account shall be forfeited and shall be deposited in the unallocated employer
account. If the actuarial evaluation required by §
94.136 shows that the assets of the unallocated employer account are sufficient
to provide for the projected plan liabilities, the forfeitures shall instead be
used to meet the expenses incurred by the city in connection with administering
the retirement system, and the remainder shall then be used to reduce the city
contribution which would otherwise be required to fund pension benefits.

   (B)   The City Administrator shall give the delinquent taxpayer written
notice of such estimated taxes, penalty and interest, which notice must be

certified mail to the taxpayer.
   (C)   Such estimate shall thereupon become an assessment, and such
assessment shall be final and due and payable from the taxpayer to the city 10
days from the date of service, if served personally, or 10 days from the date
of the notice of mailing by certified mail; however, within such 10-day period
the delinquent taxpayer may petition the City Administrator for a revision or
modification of such assessment and shall, within such 10-day period, furnish
the City Administrator the facts and correct figures showing the correct amount
of such taxes.
   (D)   Such petition shall be in writing, and the facts and figures submitted

made in writing and notice thereof shall be mailed to the taxpayer within 10

preserve for a period of 3 years all such books, invoices and other records,

for examination, inspection and audit by the City Administrator or his or her
duly authorized persons.

or cause to be made the examination, inspection or audit of books, invoices,
accounts or other records so kept or maintained by such taxpayer outside of the

required to enter into a binding agreement with the city to reimburse it for
all costs and expenses incurred by it in order to have such examination,
inspection or audit made it such place.
   (D)   For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a return, or for
the purpose of determining the amount of tax due from any taxpayer, the City
Administrator or his or her duly authorized persons, may conduct investigations
concerning any matters covered by this subchapter; and may examine any relevant
books, papers, records or memoranda of any such taxpayer.

§ 117.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses
to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of
the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within
the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene material or sexual activities.
(Ord. 3739, passed 10-21-2008)
§ 117.02 FINDINGS.
   Based on convincing documented evidence, studies, findings and reports
concerning the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses
regarding both commercial and residential areas and the nexus between sexually
oriented businesses, obscene materials and sexual exhibits and alcohol
consumption, and illegal drug distribution and use, the City Council finds:
   (A)   Sexually oriented businesses have negative secondary effects on the
existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent
to them, causing increased crime, the downgrading of property values, the
downgrading of adjacent neighborhoods making adjacent neighborhoods
significantly less attractive and less safe for raising children and
denigrating both residential life and commercial activity for other types of
businesses and sexually oriented businesses downgrade the quality of life and
fitness of property for other uses in areas both immediate and adjacent to such
businesses.
   (B)   The negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses are
increased when they are located in close proximity to each other and when the
service or consumption of alcohol is permitted at or near such locations.
   (C)   Improper conduct involving sexual acts occurs at sexually oriented
businesses which provide private or semi-private booths or viewing rooms for
the viewing of films, videos or live performances.
   (D)   The findings noted above raise substantial governmental concerns for
the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and it is
appropriate for the purpose of promoting and protecting the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the city particularly the children of the community
and those conducting general business that reasonable regulations be enacted so
as to address the substantial governmental concerns to minimize and control the
negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby promote
and protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, protect
the citizens from increased crime, preserve the value of property, and preserve
the quality of life and the quality and character of surrounding neighborhoods
for residential and commercial purposes.
   (E)   The enactment of reasonable regulations of sexually oriented
businesses which involve locational criteria, licensing criteria, operational
criteria and the prohibition of alcohol and illegal substance use are
appropriate to address the substantial governmental concerns and protect the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.
   (F)   A reasonable licensing procedure and zoning requirements are
appropriate mechanisms to place the burden of reasonable regulations on the
owners of sexually oriented businesses and such a licensing procedure will
place an incentive on the owners to see that the sexually oriented business is
operated in a manner which is consistent with the health, safety and welfare of
patrons, employees and citizens of the city.

effectively or actually changes ownership from 1 person or entity to another to
include the transfer of 50% or more of the ownership interest of an entity or
the parent of an entity. Any attempted assignment without prior written
approval shall constitute a default in the franchise. A proposed assignment
shall be subject to the following:
      (1)   At least 120 days before a proposed assignment is scheduled to
become effective, the cable operator shall make a written request to the
Council for the city's approval of the proposed assignment.
      (2)   The city will not unreasonably withhold its consent to an
assignment. However, in making its determination, the Council shall consider
the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the proposed assignee.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall restrict the city from considering
criteria established under state or federal law, rule or regulation.
      (4)   Before an assignment is approved by the city, the proposed assignee
shall sign a statement indicating that it has read, understands, and intends to
abide by any existing franchise agreement.
      (5)   The city may include certain amendment(s) to the franchise or this
chapter as a condition to the assignment; provided, however, any such amendment
(s) shall either (i) be by mutual agreement between the city and the proposed
assignee, or (ii) shall not have a material adverse effect on the rights and
obligations of the cable operator under the franchise.
      (6)   In the event of any approved assignment, the assignee shall assume
all obligations and liabilities of the former cable operator.
      (7)   The city's consent to an assignment shall not relieve the former
cable operator of its liability under the franchise agreement until the
assignment actually takes place unless specifically relieved by federal or
state law or by the Council at the time an assignment is approved. In the event
of an assignment, the former cable operator shall remain liable for any
franchise fees incurred as of the time that the assignment is effective for the
period governed by the applicable statute of limitations.
      (8)   If the cable operator has provided the city with all information as
required by this section or the FCC in a timely manner, and the city has not
taken action on the cable operator's request for transfer within 120 days after
receiving such request, consent by the city shall be deemed given.
   (B)   Consent shall not be required for an assignment to a wholly-owned
subsidiary entity of a cable operator or the current parent entity of a cable
operator, whether the ownership is direct or indirect, such as through other
wholly-owned intermediate subsidiaries. In addition, consent shall not be
required for the granting of a security interest in the cable operator's system
including its franchise. However, if the holder of the security interest
repossesses, forecloses or takes other action concerning its collateral, it
shall dispose of the cable system within a reasonable period of time and the
disposition by the holder of the security interest shall be considered an
assignment subject to the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 4016, § 1, 12-17-2019)
§ 118.23 EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL ACCESS.
   To the extent permitted by law, and in order to fulfill a public,
educational and governmental access policy that will facilitate the long range
needs of the city, each cable operator shall provide at its own expense 1 PEG
channel under the control of the city. The following shall apply to the PEG
channel:
   (A)   The city is solely responsible for the content it provides over the
PEG channel. The cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control over
any programming of the PEG channel, and shall also not be subject to any civil
or criminal liability for any programs carried on the PEG channel.
   (B)   The PEG channel may be placed on any tier of service available to all
subscribers, including the digital tier. The city shall provide programming on
the PEG channel to occupy 70% of the hours between 11:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m.
for any 12 consecutive week period. The cable operator shall provide written
notice to the city in the event that the above programming levels are not
maintained or if the city does not adequately use the channel. If the
programming is not restored to occupy 70% of the hours between 11:00 a.m. and
11:00 p.m. within a 1 week period within 30 days of written notice, the cable
operator reserves the right to have the channel returned to the cable operator
for the cable operator's use. If at any later time, which must be at least 1
year from the return of the PEG channel to the cable operator, the city desires
to utilize the PEG channel, it may notify the cable operator of its desire to
do so, and the PEG channel shall be made available to the city within 30 days
of the request. The above programming requirements shall apply with respect to
continuance of the PEG channel by the city.
   (C)   If the city is utilizing the PEG channel, signal input location shall
be provided at City Hall. Only those signal input locations actually being used
shall be required.
   (D)   Cable operators may interconnect their cable systems for the purpose
of sharing PEG access programming, provided that the cable operators are able
to reach agreement for the interconnection. Nothing in this section should be
construed as requiring a cable operator to add additional PEG channels.
(Ord. 4016, § 1, 12-17-2019)
§ 118.24 PUBLIC SERVICE.
   A cable operator shall furnish, upon request, and subject to applicable law,
1 outlet for public buildings as identified in a cable operator's franchise.
With respect to this service:
   (A)   The cable service provided pursuant to this section shall not be used
for commercial purposes and shall not generally be available for public
viewing. The city shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the
cable system that results in the inappropriate use or any loss or damage to the
cable system.
   (B)   The city shall hold the cable operator harmless from any and all
liability or claims arising out of the provision and use of cable service to
city buildings.
(Ord. 4016, § 1, 12-17-2019)
§ 118.25 DEFAULT.
   (A)   When a cable operator violates a provision of this chapter, or acts so
as to compromise the legal, financial or technical integrity and/or stability
of the cable system or the cable operator itself, in either case, to a degree
that the interests of the subscribers are negatively affected, then a cable
operator shall be considered in default of this chapter.
   (B)   Examples of a default shall include, but are not limited to:
bankruptcy (except for a reorganization as long as the cable operator is in
compliance with an approved plan or other court order), insolvency, failure to
pay taxes or franchise fees, failure to receive written city approval for an
assignment, or failure to substantially abide by the terms and conditions of
the franchise agreement or this chapter, to include the failure to operate its
cable system. Provided:
      (1)   It is not the city's intention to subject a cable operator to
penalties, fines, forfeitures or revocation of a franchise for violations where
the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal negative
impact on the subscribers within the city, or where strict performance would
result in practical difficulties and hardship to a cable operator which
outweigh the benefit to be derived by the city and/or subscribers.
      (2)   Events in the nature of force majeure or conditions which cannot be
corrected because they are matters reasonably beyond the ability of the
affected cable operator to anticipate and control shall not be considered a
default. This provision includes, but is not limited to, severe or unusual
weather conditions, fire, flood, or other acts of God, strikes, work delays
caused by failure of utility providers to service, maintain or monitor their
utility poles to which a cable operator's cable system is attached, as well as
unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work
necessary; provided, however, such noncompliance shall only be excused for as
long as the cable operator is reasonably pursuing compliance.
   (C)   In the event that a default occurs, the city shall provide written
notice of the default to the affected cable operator. The notice of default
shall specify the violation(s).
   (D)   The cable operator shall have 30 days from the receipt of the written
notice to bring itself into compliance so that it is no longer in default of
its franchise or this chapter, as the case may be; provided, however, if by the
nature of default, the default cannot be cured within this 30 day period, the
cable operator shall initiate reasonable steps to remedy the default and notify
the city of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be
completed.
   (E)   If the cable operator fails to cure its default within the time period
provided for above, the matter shall be set for public hearing before the
Council to be held within 75 days after the notice of default was mailed to the
cable operator. Written notice of the time and place of the public hearing
shall be sent to the cable operator at least 20 days prior to the date of the
hearing.
   (F)   At the hearing, the cable operator shall have an opportunity to state
its position on the matter, present evidence and question witnesses. If the
cable operator fails to attend the hearing where a continuance of the hearing
has not been granted by the Council, then the cable operator may be declared in
default of the franchise agreement.
   (G)   If the default has not been resolved by the time of or as a result of
the hearing, the Council may, after the public hearing, direct the cable
operator to take corrective action within a specified period of time, or may
declare the cable operator in default of the franchise agreement, and revoke or
terminate the franchise. The Council's action shall be delivered to the cable
operator in writing within 15 days of the Council's action.
   (H)   If the Council directs corrective action to be taken and the cable
operator does not rectify the default within the time specified, then the
Council may without further notice declare the cable operator to be in default
and revoke or terminate the franchise.
   (I)   If the cable operator fails to comply with any determination by the
Council, which determination is not stayed or overturned by order of an
appropriate court, then the city shall have any and all remedies available to
it by law, provided the cable operator may continue to operate the cable system
until all legal appeals procedures have been exhausted.
(Ord. 4016, § 1, 12-17-2019)
§ 118.26 REMOVAL OF CABLE SYSTEM.
   (A)   In the event of termination or forfeiture of a franchise agreement or
abandonment of a cable operator's cable system, the city may require the cable
operator to remove all or any portion of its cable system from all public ways;
provided, however, that the cable operator will not be required to remove those
portions of its cable system required to provide telecommunications services or
other non-cable service to the extent that the cable operator lawfully provides
telecommunications services or other non-cable service over the cable system.
   (B)   If a cable operator has failed to commence removal of its cable
system, or such part as designated by the city, within 120 days after written
demand for removal is given, or if the cable operator has failed to complete
such removal within 12 months after written demand for removal is given, the
city may apply funds secured by the franchise agreement toward removal.
(Ord. 4016, § 1, 12-17-2019)
§ 118.27 FEDERAL LEGISLATION, RULES AND REGULATIONS, FRANCHISE SUBJECT TO
AMENDMENT.
   In addition to any requirements contained within this chapter, all cable
operators shall be expected to comply with all applicable provisions of the
Cable Act and all other federal laws directed at controlling or regulating
cable operators, and any rules and regulations issued pursuant to those laws.
In addition, any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to
amendment by mutual agreement of the parties to incorporate any applicable
federal legislation, rules or regulations which become effective after the date
of the franchise.

§ 118.28 TAMPERING AND UNAUTHORIZED RECEPTION OF CERTAIN SIGNALS.
   (A)   No person shall intercept or receive, or assist in intercepting or

specifically authorized to do so by a cable operator, or as may otherwise be
specifically authorized by law.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the term ASSIST IN INTERCEPTING OR
RECEIVING shall include the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended
by the manufacturer or distributor for the unauthorized reception of cable
service.
   (C)   Without securing permission from a cable operator, or making payment
to a cable operator, then no person shall be authorized to make any connection
with any part of a cable system for the purpose of receiving or intercepting,
or assisting others to receive or intercept any cable service provided lawfully
by a cable operator.
   (D)   No person shall be authorized to willfully tamper with, remove or
damage any facilities used for the distribution of cable service.
   (E)   Any violation of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor and upon
conviction shall be subject to a fine of up to $100. Each day that the
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
(Ord. 4016, § 1, 12-17-2019)
§ 118.29 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of this chapter will be deemed severable, and if any
provision of this chapter is held illegal, void, or invalid under applicable
law, that provision may be changed to the extent reasonably necessary to make
the provision legal, valid and binding. If any provision of this chapter is
held illegal, void or invalid in its entirety, the remaining provisions of this
chapter will not be affected.

tests are necessary to determine the stability of the structural design of any
prefabricated assembly, the Code Enforcement Officer may require the tests.
During the tests, the assembly shall be subjected to loads acting at the same
points and in the same direction as the loads that would fall upon it in the
completed structure. The Code Enforcement Officer may also require reasonable
tests to be made on an assembly to determine its durability and weather
resistance. These tests shall be made in accordance with the standards of the
A.S.T.M. insofar as such standards are applicable. The expense of the tests
shall be paid by the contractor or, if there is no contractor, the owner of the
property before the assembly is approved.
   (D)   Inspections. In the case of prefabricated construction, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall also inspect the placement of prefabricated
assemblies at the building site. The Code Enforcement Officer, in his or her
discretion, may make a continuous inspection during the assembling of sidewalls
and roofs, in which event the contractor, or if there is no contractor, the
owner of the property, shall pay to the Code Enforcement Officer the costs of
the inspection.
   (E)   Materials. All materials, arrangements of materials and methods of
construction of prefabricated buildings or structures, or prefabricated parts
of buildings or structures, shall comply with the standards prescribed in the
currently adopted building code, pertaining to prefabricated materials and
construction, and in addition, as to all matters not fully governed by this
chapter pertaining to materials and construction generally. All materials and
assemblies shall be grade marked or labeled unless the material or assembly is
a type that is not marked or labeled in the construction industry.
   (F)   Loads. Prefabricated assemblies shall sustain, without failure or
undue deflection, test loads equal to the combined dead load and the minimum
live load strengths prescribed by this subchapter for construction generally.
Due compensation shall be supplied for loss of material in connection with the
installation of pipes, conduits or other equipment. Panels that are required to
be tested shall be tested after all chases and cavities for equipment have been
cut. No additional material shall be removed from any prefabricated assembly
during construction of the building or structure.
   (G)   Connections. Bolts or other devices designed to connect prefabricated
assemblies shall be capable of developing the strength of members connected and
to resist wind loads as specified in the provisions of this subchapter
pertaining to construction generally. Connections consisting of bolts or other
devices between roofs and the supporting walls shall be capable of withstanding
an uplift equal to not less than 5 pounds per square foot of horizontally
projected roof area in addition to withstanding the other stresses specified
herein. Individual units or sections of prefabricated assemblies of either
wall, roof, floor or ceiling, shall be so connected that joints shall be
weather and wind proof; and the joints shall be properly caulked in the
approved manner and covered, on the weather side, with approved battens or
other approved weather covering.

§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare. The Legislature, in Neb. RS 31-1001
to 31-1022 (as amended), has further assigned the responsibility to adopt,
administer, and enforce flood plain management regulations to the county, city
or village with zoning jurisdiction over the flood-prone area. Therefore, the
City Council of the City of North Platte, Nebraska, ordains as follows.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The flood hazard
areas of the City of North Platte, Nebraska, are subject to inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused by:
      (1)   The cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities;
      (2)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected
from flood damages.
   (C)   Methods used to analyze flood hazards. This chapter uses a reasonable
method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated
steps.
      (1)   Selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected
frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The
base flood is selected for this chapter. It is representative of large floods
which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the
particular streams subject to this chapter. It is in the general order of a
flood which could be expected to have a 1% chance of occurrence in any 1 year,
as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood Insurance Study,
and illustrative materials dated January 2, 2009, as amended.
      (2)   Calculation of water surface profiles based on an hydraulic
engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas
to convey the base flood.
      (3)   Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point.
      (4)   Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the
floodway profile.
      (5)   Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the
floodway encroachment lines, but which still is subject to inundation by the
base flood.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §
153.02(A) by applying the provisions of this chapter to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazard;
   (D)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.04 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of
North Platte, Nebraska identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated
January 2, 2009, as numbered and unnumbered A Zones (including AE, AO and AH
Zones) and within the Zoning Districts FW and FF established in §
153.14. In all areas covered by this chapter no development shall be permitted
except upon the issuance of a flood plain permit to develop, granted by the
City Council of the City of North Platte or its duly designated representative
under such safeguards and restrictions as the City Council or the designated
representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the
general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where
specifically noted in §§
153.17, 153.18, 153.19, 153.20 and 153.21.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.05 ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL.
   The Code Enforcement Official of the community is hereby designated as the
community's duly designated Enforcement Officer under this chapter.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.06 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be
determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map or Floodway Map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact
location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning
map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement Officer shall make the
necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested,
the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood
elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating
the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the
district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case
to the Board of Adjustment and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so
desires.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.07 COMPLIANCE.
   Within identified special flood hazard areas of this community, no
development shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable
regulations.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.08 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existent easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this chapter shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.09 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of
any other powers granted by state statutes.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.10 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height
may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas outside
floodway and flood fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within
such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall
not create liability on the part of the City of North Platte or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.11 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.12 APPEAL.
   Where a request for a permit to develop or a variance is denied by the Code
Enforcement Official, the applicant may apply for such permit or variance
directly to the Board of Adjustment.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.13 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, firm or corporation shall initiate any flood plain development or
substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a
separate permit for development as defined in §
153.17.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.14 ADMINISTRATION.

§ 153.16 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   Along watercourses where a floodway has been established, the mapped flood
plain areas are hereby divided into the two following districts: A floodway
overlay district (FW) and a flood fringe overlay district (FF) as identified in
the Flood Insurance Study [and accompanying map(s)]. Within these districts all
uses not meeting the standards of this chapter and those standards of the
underlying zoning district shall be prohibited.
(Ord. 3779, passed 11-3-2009)
§ 153.17 STANDARDS FOR FLOOD PLAIN DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   No permit for development shall be granted for new construction,
substantial improvements and other developments including the placement of
manufactured homes within all numbered and unnumbered A zones (including AE,
AO, and AH zones) unless the conditions of this section are satisfied.

inundation of the base flood; however, the water surface elevation was not
provided. The unnumbered A zones shall be subject to all development provisions
of §§
153.18 and
153.19. If Flood Insurance Study data is not available, the community shall
utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from
federal, state or other sources.
   (C)   Until a floodway has been designated, no development or substantial
improvement may be permitted within special flood hazard areas unless the
applicant has demonstrated that the proposed development or substantial
improvement, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated

§ 153.23 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing items listed in divisions (B) through (F) below
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (C)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels along the floodway profile during the base flood
discharge would result.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (E)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   Showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (F)   The applicant shall be given a written notice over the signature of a
community official that:
      (1)   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and
      (2)   Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all
variance actions as required by this chapter.

with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
      (1)   If such use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this ordinance. The Utility
Department shall notify the Code Enforcement Official in writing of instances
of nonconforming uses where utility services have been discontinued for a
period of 12 months.
      (2)   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   (B)   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred except that if it
is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or regulations or
the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places, provided that the
alteration shall not preclude its continued designation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001 TITLE OF CHAPTER.
   This chapter shall be known and cited as the “Sign Ordinance”.
(Ord. 3680, § 1, 3-6-2007)
§ 154.002 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to meet requirements of state and
federal regulations in regulating exterior signs so as to protect values, to
protect the character of various use areas of the city, to protect the health,
safety and public welfare of the citizens of the city and to protect and
promote the aesthetic integrity of the city.
   (B)   The principal features are the restriction of advertising to the
business or use of the premises on which the sign is located unless otherwise
permitted and the restriction of the total sign area permissible per site. Any
sign placed on land or on a building for the purposes of identification or for
advertising a use conducted therein or thereon shall be deemed to be accessory
and incidental to the land, building or use. It is intended that the display of
signs will be appropriate to the land, building or use to which they are
appurtenant and be adequate, but not excessive, for the intended purpose of
identification or advertisement. With respect to signs advertising business
uses, it is specifically intended, among other things, to avoid excessive
competition and clutter among sign displays in their demand for public
attention. It is further intended that in commercial areas now in existence,
and more so in proposed commercial and industrial areas, all signs within 1
complex be coordinated with the architecture in such a manner that the overall
appearance is harmonious in color, form and proportion.
   (C)   It is also intended by this chapter that all temporary signs erected
for directional purposes, for public information, or to call attention to
special events shall be confined to those that are of general public interest
and that the signs shall be limited to the giving of information.

§ 156.286 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Within the Airport Hazard Area, no non-conforming building,
transmission line, pole, tower, chimney, wires, or other structure or
appurtenance of any kind or character or object of natural growth, and no such
structures or objects of natural growth have been torn down, destroyed, have
deteriorated or decayed to an extent of 50% or more of their original
condition, or abandoned for a period of 12 months or more, shall hereafter be
replaced, substantially reconstructed, repaired, altered, replanted, or allowed
to grow, as the case may be, to a height above the heights permitted by these
regulations. Transmission lines and other communication lines shall be
interpreted as all poles, wires, guys and all other equipment necessary for the
operation and maintenance of same within the regulated zone.
   (B)   Except as provided in division (C) below for certain electric
facilities, all such airport zoning regulations adopted under the act shall
provide that before any non-conforming structure or tree may be replaced,
substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or
replanted, a permit authorizing any replacement, alteration, repair,
reconstruction, growth, or replanting must be secured from the administrative
agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations. A permit shall be
granted under this division if the applicant shows that the replacement,
alteration, repair, reconstruction, growth, or replanting of the non-conforming
structure, tree, or non-conforming use would not result in an increase in
height or a greater hazard to air navigation than the condition that existed
when the applicable regulation was adopted. For non-conforming structures other
than electric facilities, no permit under this division shall be required for
repairs necessitated by fire, explosion, act of God, or the common enemy or for
repairs which do not involve expenditures exceeding more than 60% of the fair
market value of the non-conforming structure, so long as the height of the non-
conforming structure is not increased over its preexisting height.
   (C)   An electric supplier owning or operating an electric facility made
non-conforming by the adoption of airport zoning regulations under the Airport
Zoning Act may, without a permit or other approval by the political subdivision
adopting such regulations, repair, reconstruct, or replace such electric
facility if the height of such electric facility is not increased over its
preexisting height. Any construction, repair, reconstruction, or replacement of
an electric facility, the height of which will exceed the preexisting height of
such electric facility, shall require a permit from the political subdivision
adopting such regulations. The permit shall be granted only upon a showing that
the excess height of the electric facility will not establish or create an
airport hazard or become a greater hazard to air navigation than the electric
facility that previously existed.
(Ord. 3887, passed 1-21-2014)
§ 156.287 MARKING OF NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that a specific structure or
object in the Airport Hazard Area exceeds the height restrictions and existed
prior to the promulgation of these regulations, the owner(s) and/or the lessor
(s) of the premises on which the structure or object is located shall be
notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator. The owner(s) and lessor(s)
shall, within a reasonable time, permit the marking and lighting of the
structure or object. The Zoning Administrator shall specify the required
marking and lighting, consistent with these regulations entitled "Marking and
Lighting of Structures". The cost of marking or lighting shall not be assessed
against the owner or lessor of said premises.

§ 156.288.1 VARIANCE FROM REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Any person desiring to erect any structure, increase the height of any
structure, permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his or her property
in a manner inconsistent with the airport zoning regulations adopted under this
regulation may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from the zoning
regulations in question. Such variances shall be allowed only if the Board of
Adjustment makes the same findings for the granting of variances generally as
set forth in Neb. RS 19-907 through 19-912.01, except that if the applicant
demonstrates that the proposed structure or alteration of a structure does not
require any modification or revision to any approach or approach procedure as
approved or written by the Federal Aviation Administration on either an
existing or proposed runway and the applicant provides signed documentation
from the Federal Aviation Administration that the proposed structure or
alteration of the structure will not require any modification or revision of
any airport minimums, such documentation may constitute evidence of undue
hardship and the Board of Adjustment may grant the requested variance without
such findings. Any variance may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions
that the Board of Adjustment may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of
this regulation.
   (B)   In granting any permit under or variance from any airport zoning
regulation adopted under this regulation, the administrative agency or Board of
Adjustment may, if it deems such action is advisable to effectuate the purposes
of the regulation and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit
or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to
permit the political subdivision, at its own expense, to install, operate, and
maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to
flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

§ 156.299 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose of standards. Recognizing that unrestricted use of residential
properties for purposes of an occupational nature other than that normally
associated with home living has a detrimental effect on both the residential
area in which the occupations are conducted and the areas properly designated
for such uses and further recognizing that this detrimental effect results in
the depreciation of values, welfare, happiness and morale of the entire
community, it is the purpose of this section to eliminate this detrimental
effect by creating performance standards for the establishment and conditions
for the operation and continuance of home occupations.
(Prior Code, § 56-430)
   (B)   Definition.

a commodity on the premises will be permitted. In connection with a home
occupation, no sign or display other than a nameplate not more than 2 square
feet in area shall be used to indicate from the exterior that the building is
being utilized in part for any purpose other than that of a dwelling. Uses that
generate traffic or parking problems or that would change the residential
character of the immediate neighborhood shall not be deemed to be suitable for
home occupation permits.

of area where the occupation will occur, a description of the home occupation,
number of persons employed, hours of operation, materials produced, used on the
occupation and types and sizes of vehicles used on the home occupation
including the area for parking, signature of owner/operator of the home
occupation agreeing to comply with the city home occupation performance
standards and such other pertinent information required or deemed necessary by
the Director of Development or his or her designee to determine the applicant's
conformance to the home occupation performance standards.
(Prior Code, § 56-432)
   (D)   Filing fee. A fee prescribed in the City Council's annual resolution
of service charges shall be paid to the Development Department.
(Prior Code, § 56-433)
   (E)   Permit application approval. No home occupation shall be conducted in
a residential zoning district until the Development Director or his or her
authorized agent has approved the home occupation permit application and found
all compliance with the home occupation performance standards identified in
division (F) below. A home occupation application is valid for 5 years from the
date of approval.
(Prior Code, § 56-434)
   (F)   Performance standards. The performance standards for a home occupation
are as follows:
      (1)   No employment outside the immediate family;

trips per day;
      (7)   No parking problems;
      (8)   Limited to use of the main building only;
      (9)   Limited to use of normal residential vehicles. No commercial rated

residing in a residential zone; and
      (12)   Buying or selling of a commodity on the premises is limited to
incidental sales totaling no more than 10% of total gross income generated by
the use.

§ 156.313 COMMERCIAL SOLAR CONVERSIONS SYSTEMS (CSCS) REGULATIONS (SOLAR
FARMS).
   (A)   Intent. The intent of this section is to provide standards for fixed-
panel photovoltaic solar farms or CSCS consisting of ground-mounted solar
panels capturing energy from the sun and converting it to electricity. The
provisions of this section are based on a ground-mounted photovoltaic facility
using a rammed post construction technique and panels that support the flow of
rainwater between each module and the growth of vegetation beneath the arrays
and limiting the impacts of stormwater runoff. The rammed post-construction
technique allows for minimal disturbance to the existing ground and grading of
the site. Based on the assumed solar farm design, the use should be low
intensity with minimal trip generation, low amounts of impervious cover, and
low emission thus the use is compatible in urbanized, non-urbanized, or low-
density areas with other uses.
   (B)   Permitted by conditional use in the following zoning districts: I-
2 Heavy Industrial, I-1 Light Industrial, A-1 Transitional Agricultural.
   (C)   Site development standards.
      (1)   Lot coverage. No more than 1% of the gross site area shall be
occupied by enclosed buildings and structures.
      (2)   Setbacks. Will adhere to setbacks of that zoning district.
      (3)   Height. The average height of the solar panel arrays shall not
exceed 12 feet.
      (4)   Landscaping buffer. The primary use of the property shall determine
the buffer requirement. Where a ground-mounted photovoltaic solar farm is the
primary use the property shall be considered industrial or agricultural for the
purposes of buffer requirements, there are no requirements for screening from
public streets.
      (5)   Stormwater management plan. Must be submitted as part of the
application process.
      (6)   Decommissioning plan. A decommissioning plan shall be required to
ensure that facilities are properly removed after their useful life.
Decommissioning of solar panels must occur in the event they are not in use for
12 consecutive months. The plan shall include provisions for removal of all
structures and foundations, restoration of soil and vegetation and a plan
ensuring financial resources will be available to fully decommission the site.
The City of North Platte reserves the right to require the posting of a bond,
letter of credit or establishment of an escrow account to ensure proper
decommissioning.
   (D)   Solar farm or CSCS must meet all other federal, state, or local
regulations applicable to construction.
(Ord. 4180, § 1, 10-29-2024)

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 156.335 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   All the districts except the A and F Districts shall have a separate and
distinct counterpart referred to as planned residential districts, planned
business districts, and planned industrial parks. The purpose of a planned
district shall be to permit and regulate the uses permitted under this chapter
in the equivalent district, and to further provide for and encourage
flexibility in the location of buildings, structures, roads and drives,
variations in yards, and open spaces, subsequent to plan approval by the
Planning Commission, Mayor and City Council. It is the intent to allow the
development of tracts of land to their fullest extent, observing the general
intent and spirit of this chapter. Along the periphery of the planned
developments, yards shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
district in which the development is located.
(Prior Code, § 56-491) (Am. Ord. 3840, § 1, 4-3-2012)

PR-4             R-4
PR-L             R-L
 
   (B)   The height and bulk of buildings, total area, amount of open space,
light and air, the density of population and the parking requirements shall be
equal to those in the equivalent district. The uses permitted shall be the same
as in the equivalent district, except that there may be, in part of the area of
the development, specified uses not permitted by the use regulations in which
the development is located, provided that the Planning Commission shall find
that:
      (1)   The uses permitted by the exception are necessary or desirable and
are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development;
      (2)   The uses permitted by the exception are not of such a nature or so
located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding neighborhood;
and
      (3)   Not more than 20% of the ground area or of the gross floor area of
the development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by the exception.

§ 156.337 VARIATIONS FROM REGULATIONS.
   Variations and departures from normal practice may be permitted under this
subchapter. Each building need not face on a public street and more than 1
building may be located on a lot. Buildings maybe constructed on platted tracts
which are smaller than the minimum lot size requirements where other adjacent
permanent open space is provided. Buildings maybe served by private drives in
lieu of public streets. Buildings maybe located closer to lot lines than
otherwise permitted; provided, the buildings are architecturally suitable for
such a relationship to adjoining buildings and property. Any building or
portion thereof maybe owned in condominium ownership under applicable state
laws governing condominiums. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted
shall be determined by dividing the net development area by the minimum lot
area per dwelling unit required by the district in which the area is located
and increasing the resulting figure by 15%. Net development area shall be
determined by subtracting the area set aside for non-residential uses from the
gross development area and deducting 10% of the remainder for streets,
regardless of the amount of land actually required for streets. The area of
land set aside for common open space or recreational use may be included in
determining the number of dwelling units permitted. However, no variations will
be permitted for above ground storage tanks.

   (A)   Intent. It is the intent of this subchapter that all buildings,
structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space
in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land
and that the parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are readily
usable for the purpose.
   (B)   Additions to existing buildings. No addition to an existing building
shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of
existing parking or loading space unless the building and its addition conform
with the regulations for parking and loading contained in this subchapter.
Building additions of 10% or less of existing building square footage shall not
require any additional parking spaces except for additions to places of
assembly.
   (C)   Required facilities. The uses listed in §
156.351 shall provide parking and loading in the amounts specified and at
locations specified for the group in which the use falls.
   (D)   Multiple uses.  If several uses occupy a single building or parcel of
land, the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of the
requirements of the separate uses computed separately.
   (E)   Completion of improvements. No final inspection by the Development
Department shall be approved unless either all the improvements required by
this subchapter are completed and in place or an acceptable cash bond or
corporate surety bond written by a corporate surety doing business through an
agent in the amount of the estimated cost of the improvements has been approved
by and deposited with the Building Inspector.

§ 156.352 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR PARKING LOTS.
   (A)   General. This standard shall apply to all parking lots located within
the zoning jurisdiction of the City of North Platte. Title 28 CF.R. part 36
(ADA Accessibility Guidelines), Title 156, Nebraska Administrative Code -
Nebraska Accessibility Requirements; and the City of North Platte, Nebraska
Design Standards for Screening and Landscaping; generally apply to the design
of parking lots in the City of North Platte.
(Prior Code, § 56-524)
   (B)   Policies. All plans for the construction of parking lots shall be
reviewed and approved by the Department of Engineering and landscape design
shall be reviewed and approved by the city's Development Department.
(Prior Code, § 56-525)
   (C)   Design.
      (1)   Layout.
         (a)   The size, location and orientation of the parking spaces and
aisles shall conform to the details shown in Figure PL-1. Barriers and islands
should generally conform to the details shown on Figure PL-2.
         (b)   Required accessible parking spaces, including van-accessible
spaces, shall be located, designed, marked and signed in conformance with the
requirements of 28 CF.R. part 36 (ADA Accessibility Guidelines) and Title 156,
Nebraska Administrative Code - Nebraska Accessibility Requirements.
         (c)   Upon completion of construction of the parking lot, the required
parking spaces shall be marked on the parking lot surface with paint formulated
for that purpose and in accordance with the approved layout. Parking spaces
provided in excess of the number required under this code or as required by
conditions of a special permit need not be marked, or they may be marked to
lesser standards.
      (2)   Driveway approaches. Driveway approaches shall conform to the
requirements of this code.
      (3)   Parking barriers.
         (a)   Parking barriers must be provided around parking lots to prevent
the parked vehicles from overhanging the required yards where parking is
prohibited, sidewalk space, public streets, public alleys or other public or
private property and to protect any required landscaping or landscape screen
planting. Approved barriers include the following types:
            1.   Poured concrete curb, nominal 6 inches by 6 inches (152 x 152
mm) exposed;
            2.   Fence, minimum 30 inches (762 mm) height, wire fabric, solid
wood, post and rail and the like;
            3.   Masonry, modular segmental block or concrete wall, minimum 30
inches (762 mm) height;
            4.   Beam guardrail;
            5.   Post and cable guardrail; and
            6.   Precast concrete wheel stop, firmly and permanently anchored.
         (b)   Other barriers, which fulfill the required function, maybe
permitted, subject to approval by the Engineering Department. Barriers must be
located to contain the parking within the approved parking lot. When a concrete
curb or precast wheel stop is used as a barrier for perpendicular or angle
parking, it must be offset at least 2 feet (0.6 m) from the edge of the parking
lot to allow for the front overhang of the vehicle.
      (4)   Drainage.
         (a)   Parking lots shall be designed to properly manage the surface
drainage accumulating on and flowing onto the site.
         (b)   For new parking lots containing 6,000 square feet (557 square
meters) or more and which are located within 150 feet (45.7 m) of, or
reasonably accessible to, an existing storm sewer or other drainage way,
including open channels and creeks, but excluding roadway gutters, the parking
lot must be graded and surfaced such that stormwater runoff from the site is
not allowed to discharge through the driveway approaches onto the public street
or other property, but is collected on the site by an internal drainage system
located on the site and carried to that existing storm sewer. Use of parking
lot surfaces and surrounding landscaped areas to provide stormwater detention
is encouraged.
         (c)   Parking lot drainage facilities and appurtenances shall be
designed and constructed in conformance with the requirements of this code.
      (5)   Surfacing.
         (a)   All new parking lots created after January 1, 2002, shall be
designed/developed and surfaced with portland cement concrete pavement,
asphaltic concrete pavement, brick or modular pavers, open landscaping paving
blocks, pervious asphalt surfaces with subdrains or other permanent surfacing
approved by the Engineering Department. In parking lots and drive areas where
moderate to heavy truck traffic is anticipated, the structural capacity of the
surfacing should be analyzed by the design engineer and property owner and the
pavement structure designed accordingly. The instances may require thicker or
reinforced sections and special subgrade treatments.
         (b)   Non-permanent parking lots maybe graveled as approved by the
city and shall be maintained in a dust-free condition during the period they
are permitted.
      (6)   Lighting and lighting performance standards.
         (a)   The purpose of parking lot lighting is to provide adequate
visibility within the parking lot and to enhance the security and safety of the
lot users. It should not cause interference to traffic on public thoroughfares
or encroach on the visual privacy of adjacent residents.
         (b)   All exterior lights shall be designed, located, installed and
directed in such a manner as to prevent objectionable light trespass and glare
across the property lines and/or disability glare at any location on or off the
property.
         (c)   All parking area lighting shall be full cut-off type fixtures.
         (d)   All building lighting for security shall be full cut-off type or
a shielded type, not allowing any upward distribution of light. Flood lighting
is discouraged and, if used, must be shielded.
         (e)   Outdoor non-residential lighting adjacent to residential
property shall be installed to ensure that no direct light source shall be
visible at the property line at ground level or above.
         (f)   Area lighting shall be conducted so that the light source is
directed away from areas in residential use or shall be controlled so that
candlepower per 1,000 lamp lumens does not numerically exceed 50 lamp lumens
(5%) above the vertical angle of 78 degrees above nadir; or emit more than 150
foot-candles per unit projected surface area of the luminaire above a 78 degree
vertical angle.
         (g)   Illumination resulting from outdoor lighting shall be conducted
so that direct or indirect illumination does not exceed 1.0 horizontal foot
candles at a boundary line with an adjacent residential zoning district.
         (h)   Measurements shall be made with a cosine corrected photoelectric
photometer having a spectral response corrected to fit the luminous efficiency
curve established by the International Commission on Illumination.
         (i)   In areas where non-residential development abuts residential
development, site lighting plans shall be submitted to the city which include:
            1.   Site plan showing foot candle lighting on the site and across
property lines. Fixture type and location shall be shown on the plan; and
            2.   A COMCheck, as required by the State of Nebraska Energy shall
be provided.
         (j)   Any variation to the above lighting and light performance
standards shall be reviewed and may be approved at the discretion of the City
Engineer, City Planner and City Administrator.
      (7)   Sidewalks. A pedestrian walkway maybe required across or through
parking lots by the city's Engineering Department to provide for pedestrian
circulation along a direct route to an adjacent sidewalk system. Barrier-free
access should also be provided across parking lots and between adjacent
pedestrian generators such as commercial or public buildings. Barrier-free
access may include providing ramps at curbs, clear walkways between precast
wheel stops, and clearly delineated walkways on the parking lot surface. Where
the most direct pedestrian route between 2 pedestrian traffic generators is
parallel to an internal roadway having a projected average daily traffic volume
(ADT) of more than 2,000 vehicles, a separate pedestrian walkway may be
required by the city's Engineering Department.

NON-CONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
§ 156.370 NONCONFORMING, GENERAL INTENT.
   It is the intent of this subchapter is to permit lawful nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not encourage their survival. Such uses
are declared by this subchapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this subchapter that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district except as may be authorized in this title.
(Prior Code, § 56-561) (Am. Ord. 3840, § 1, 4-3-2012; Am. Ord. 4092, § 1, 6-7-

   (B)   Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any such structure described in this
section may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled; provided, however,
that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or remodeling shall either create
any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity
of all or any part of such structure, except that as to structures located on a
lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side
yard requirements shall be in conformance with this section, and unless
otherwise permitted by a variance permit unless otherwise approved or as
specified in the residential district.
   (C)   Damage or destruction.
      (1)   In the event that any structure described in §
156.372 is damaged or destroyed, by any means other than intentional

structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the zoning district in which it is located; provided that
structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size
requirements shall not have a side yard of less than 5 feet. When a structure

extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment or this subchapter.

other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this subchapter.

period of more than 12 consecutive months, any subsequent use of such land
shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in
which such land is located.
   (B)   Nonconforming uses of structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or
of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this subchapter, that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structures and premises may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the Board of Adjustment either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate
conditions and safeguard in accord with the provisions of this chapter;
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises
in combination is discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, the
structure or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used
except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located;
      (6)   Where nonconforming use status is applied to a structure and
premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
(Ord. 4092, § 1, 6-7-2022)
§ 156.374 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use,

provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of
passage of amendment of this subchapter shall not be increased.

extensions, expansions, and the remodeling or rebuilding of such structures or
extensions or expansions of a land use in all cases where a refusal to do so
would bring hardship to the owner or occupants and in all cases where justice
requires the granting of the same. The City Council may attach appropriate
conditions to the granting of any such relief. Whenever a use district shall be
hereafter changed, any then existing nonconforming use in such changed district
may be continued or changed to a use permitted in that zoning district,
provided, all other regulations governing the new use are complied with.
   (B)   Nonconforming mobile homes situated on residential zoned lots are
allowed to extend the nonconformity with approval of a permit application if

or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures;
      (2)   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of any
regulation, requests for interpretation of any map; and
      (3)   Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of
a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning
regulation, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of the piece of property,
the strict application of any enacted regulation would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardships upon
the owner of the property, to authorize, upon an appeal relating to the
property, a variance from the strict application so as to relieve such
difficulties or hardships, if the relief maybe granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and
purpose of any ordinance or resolution. No such variation shall be authorized
by the Board unless it finds:

hardship;
         (b)   The hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the
same zoning district and the same vicinity;

detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be
changed by the granting of the variance;

demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit or caprice; and
         (e)   The Board finds that the condition or situation of the property
concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring
a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the zoning regulation.

reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such
administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
