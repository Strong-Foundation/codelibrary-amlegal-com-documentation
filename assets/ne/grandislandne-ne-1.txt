2-64   Legislative Finding And Intent
   A.   The City Council hereby finds and declares, based upon the scientific
and medical evidence before it, that:
      1.   the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted and continues to
dramatically impact the citizens of the City of Grand Island, Nebraska; and
      2.   exposure to COVID-19 presents a risk of death or serious long-term
disability; the exposure is widespread and poses significant risk of harm,
including death, to people in the general population of the City of Grand
Island; there is a particular subset of the population that is more vulnerable
to the threat and thus at an increased risk; and the threat is from a novel
infectious disease; and
      3.   information from the World Health Organization, the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Nebraska Department of Health
and Human Services, the Central District Health Department, local public health
departments throughout Nebraska, and members of the City of Grand Island and
Hall County medical community indicates that citizens of the City of Grand
Island have been and will continue to be exposed due to community transmissions
of COVID-19; and
      4.   the manner in which the spread of COVID-19 cases in the City of
Grand Island has occurred creates an unacceptable risk to the health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of the City of Grand Island; and
      5.   the number of COVID-19 infections within the City of Grand Island
continues to increase; and
      6.   COVID-19 constitutes a public nuisance and a threat to the health,
safety, and welfare of the City of Grand Island; and
      7.   the CDC, doctors and infectious disease experts from the University
of Nebraska Medical Center and Nebraska Medicine have concluded that the
wearing of face coverings by every individual while in public is one of the
best methods to slow and stop the spread of COVID-19; and
      8.   the wearing of face coverings by every individual while indoors in
public places in the City of Grand Island will reduce community transmissions
of COVID-19, resulting in fewer deaths, serious health complications, and will
ease the strain on hospitals and other medical offices and facilities; and
      9.   the wearing of face coverings by every individual while indoors in
public places in the City of Grand Island will help keep businesses open and
operating, encouraging economic growth, and preventing prolonged economic harm;
and
      10.   this ordinance is designated as an urgent measure necessary to
preservation of public health; and
      11.   it is just and proper for the City Council to exercise the
authority granted to it by Nebraska statutes in furtherance of protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
2-65   Definitions
For purposes of this Article, the following terms are defined as follows:

worn properly, must cover the nose and mouth completely and can include a paper
or disposable face mask, cloth face mask, scarf, bandana, neck gaiter, or a
religious face covering. Medical-grade masks and respirators are sufficient
face coverings, but to preserve adequate supplies, their purchase and use is
discouraged for those who do not work in a health care setting or in other
occupations that require medical-grade personal protective equipment. Masks
that incorporate a valve designed to facilitate easy exhaling, mesh masks, or
masks with openings, holes, visible gaps in the design or material, or vents
are not sufficient face coverings because they allow exhaled droplets to be
released into the air.

public is broadly defined to include entities that employ or engage workers,
including private-sector entities, public-sector entities, non-profit entities,

vehicles, or vehicles used for business purposes), and any place which is

facilities.
2-66   Individual Facial Coverings Required

premises open to the general public from requiring an individual to wear a face
covering during any of the circumstances enumerated above or from implementing
a more restrictive face covering policy.
2-67   Premises Open To The General Public -- Duty To Require Facial Coverings

installed by telephone companies to protect telephone equipment or systems
which might be damaged or disrupted by the use of an alarm system.
False alarm is any signal created by an alarm system (including but not limited

notifies Public Safety personnel of the occurrence of a burglary, robbery,
other criminal offense, fire emergency or medical emergency when no such
emergency exists and when law enforcement, fire, or emergency medical personnel

emergency, or medical emergency.

   A.   Alarm systems must incorporate a device that allows an adequate delay
before the time at which activation of the system would directly or indirectly
signal Public Safety personnel, or signal other parties who in turn might be
expected to notify Public Safety personnel. This delay is to permit the
subscriber to stop a false alarm from being transmitted.
   B.   The alarm system shall incorporate a device that limits any exterior
signal to a period of time not to exceed fifteen minutes in duration. At the
expiration of the maximum time permitted, the alarm system shall automatically

Safety personnel directly or indirectly through automatic telephone recording
devices or to register a signal which is so audible, visible, or in other ways
perceptible outside a protected building, structure, or facility as to notify
persons in the neighborhood who may in turn notify Public Safety personnel of
the signal.
(Amended by Ordinance No. 9037, effective 04-12-2006)

8-9.1   IBC - Amend Section 708 By Adding Section 708.9 Tenant Separation
Section 110 of the International Building Code shall be amended to include the
following subsection:
Section 110.7. Reinspections.
A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when
such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when
corrections called for are not made.
This section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first
time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this
code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job
is ready for such inspection or reinspection.
Reinspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted
or otherwise available on the work site, the approved plans are not readily
available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which
inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of
the building official.
To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall file an application therefore in
writing on a
form furnished for that purpose and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with
the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule.
In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional
inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been
paid.

9-5   Definitions
   A.   A/B switch or Input selector switch means any device that enables a
viewer to select between a multi-channel service and off-the-air television
signals. Such a device may be more sophisticated than a mere two-sided switch,
may utilize other multi-channel system interface equipment, and may be built
into television receivers.
   B.   Access channel or non-broadcast channel means a government, education,
or public channel which is carried on a multi-channel system, but which is not
part of any institutional network.
   C.   Activated channel means a channel engineered at the headend of the
cable system for the provision of services generally available to residential
subscribers of the cable system, regardless of whether such services actually
are provided, including any channel designated for governmental, educational,
or public use.
   D.   Abandoned calls mean telephone calls that are connected to an MCS
provider's general information and service number, but the caller hangs up
without being attended to by a representative of the MCS provider, or by a
device capable of problem resolution (e. g. accepting a service request or a
work order, directing calls to the appropriate personnel, or such similar
functions or service).
   E.   Alternative user charge means a charge used in place of a franchise fee
that the Council requires as payment for the privilege of using the streets,
easements, public ways, or rights-of-way, of the City in order to construct,
maintain, and operate a multi-channel system. An alternative user fee is not
based on an MCS provider's gross annual revenues (as is the case in a franchise
fee), but rather is based on the value of the City property that an MCS
provider is using to construct, maintain, and operate its multi-channel system.
   F.   Annual gross revenues means any and all compensation which is derived
from the operation of the MCS system, and which is attributable to the

revenues" means any, and all, compensation, in whatever form (except as
exempted by this definition), exchange or otherwise derived from all multi-
channel services, MCS operations, and MCS-related activities within the City

regulation that would impose an undue economic burden on cable systems.

acquisition, abandonment, withdrawal, cessation of service, revocation,

and is in conflict with an expressed right that is specifically noted in an
existing franchise agreement (but only for the term of the existing franchise);

create such an undue economic hardship on an MCS provider so as to imperil or
eliminate an MCS provider's ability to provide multi-channel service to a
majority of current subscribers; or

operation, or customer service policy, which the Council/franchising authority

provider may petition for clarification on the precise intent and effect that
one (1) or more provisions or sections of this ordinance has on the petitioning

may charge the petitioning MCS provider with the actual costs for processing

exemption, or relief, or clarification, to a franchised MCS provider, or deems
a franchised MCS provider's operational policy to be comparable to an ordinance
provision, then the franchise agreement (initial, existing, or renewal) shall
be amended within thirty (30) days to reflect the exact extent of such
exemption and/or relief. It should be specifically noted that the benefit of
such exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy extends only to the
MCS provider granted such exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable
policy.

provisions.

note such exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy, and to the

specifically noted exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy
language contained in the franchise agreement controls.

   B.   The Council/franchising authority, to the extent permitted by Section
623 of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 543), retains the power to approve the
rates or charges associated with the providing of multi-channel service
classified as cable service by an MCS provider classified as a cable operator.
   C.   Subject to preemption by, or other approval authority of, the FCC, or
any other Federal or State governmental entity or retains the jurisdiction to
enforce all laws and regulations relating to multi-channel customer service
practices and consumer protection.
9-19   MCS Provider May Promulgate Rules
To the extent that they are consistent with the requirements and
responsibilities detailed in this ordinance, an MCS provider is authorized to
promulgate such rules and internal practices as shall be necessary to enable it
to exercise its rights and perform its duties under this ordinance, the state,
and the rules of any federal agency charged with the responsibility of
regulating MCS providers.
9-20   Notices
   A.   Both the Council/franchising authority and each non-exempt MCS provider

designated to receive notices, filings, reports, records, documents, and other
correspondence. All notices shall be delivered to each party's contact person
by certified mail, return receipt requested, personal service with a signed
receipt of delivery, or overnight with receipt verification. All other filings,

designation of such contact person for notice purposes, may be contained within
a franchise agreement.

to follow the regulations established by the Federal Communications Commission
for the regulation of rates.
   B.   The initial fees to be charged to subscribers for all services,
including installation fees and other one-time charges, shall be specified in
any franchise agreement issued pursuant hereto.
   C.   Those fees and charges subject to regulation by the City pursuant to
state and federal law shall not be increased without prior review by the City.
   D.   In order to obtain City review for rate increases, the franchisee shall

and the justification for said increases and charges. The franchisee shall
promptly submit any additional supporting information requested by the City.
   E.   Within thirty days of the rate increase filing, the City shall schedule
two public meetings before the Council to hear ratepayer and franchisee comment
on the proposed increase. Following the public meeting, the Council may

prior to the expiration of the thirty-day period, unless the thirty-day
deadline is tolled by the City for an additional ninety days to consider the
request.
   F.   At least thirty days prior to the proposed rate increase, each
ratepayer or subscriber shall be notified in writing by the franchisee of the
changes in rates proposed.
   G.   Rates and charges may be reduced at any time without prior City
approval, provided that the reductions do not result in rates which are
unreasonably discriminatory to any subscriber or class of subscribers. Where
temporary reductions are put into effect for promotional purposes for a
specified time period, the return to the permanent rates shall not be
considered a rate increase for purposes of this chapter. The City shall be
notified of all reductions in rates, whether permanent or temporary.
   H.   Rates and charges not subject to regulation by the City under state or
federal law or regulation may be changed by the franchisee following a minimum
thirty days prior notice to the City and the subscribers.

times defend, indemnify, protect, save and hold harmless, and exempt the City,
the Mayor, the City Administrator, the Council/franchising authority, their
officers, agents, servants, and employees from any, and all, penalty, damage,
or charges arising out of claims, suits, demands, causes of action, or award of
damages whether compensatory or punitive, or expenses arising therefrom, either
at law or in equity, which might be claimed now or in the future, which may
arise out of, or be caused by, the construction, erection, location, products
performance, operation, maintenance, repair, installation, replacement, removal
or restoration of the multi-channel system within the City by a negligent act
or omission of an MCS provider, its agents or employees, contractors,
subcontractors, independent contractors, or implied or authorized
representatives. With respect to the penalties, damages or charges referenced
herein, attorneys' fees, consultants' fees, and expert witness fees are
included as those costs which may be recovered by the Council/franchising
authority.

Council/franchising authority, then any one of them shall have the right to
approve counsel.
   D.   Neither the City, the Mayor, nor the Council/franchising authority
shall unreasonably withhold its approval of counsel.
   E.   With respect to an MCS provider's own defense of such actions, noted in
this Section, it is understood, that such MCS provider reserves the right to
select and retain, without the Council/franchising authority's approval,
counsel of the MCS provider's choice, at such provider's expense.
   F.   Where arbitration is permitted in a franchise agreement, or agreed to
in writing by the MCS provider and Council/franchising authority, the
arbitration provisions shall specify to what extent costs are to be borne by
either the Council/franchising authority, and the MCS provider.
9-27   Liability Insurance

multi-channel service to subscribers, public liability, property damage
insurance, and umbrella coverage in at least the following amounts:
      1.   Public liability: $2,000,000.00 per person/per occurrence;
      2.   Property damage: $2,000,000.00 per any one (1) claim;
      3.   Umbrella liability: $4,000,000.00 with up to a $50,000.00 deductible
and/or base insurance.

insurance policy shall specifically include the City, the Mayor, the Council/
franchising authority, their officials, agents, employees or representatives as
additional insureds.
   C.   The public and personal liability and property damage insurance policy
shall be issued by an agent or representative of an insurance company licensed
to do business in the State, and which has one (1) of the three highest or best
ratings from the Alfred M. Best Company, and which is acceptable to the City/

subscribers, the MCS provider shall deliver the policies or certificates
representing the insurance to the Council/franchising authority, and each
policy or certificate delivered shall be accompanied by evidence of payment of
the premium thereon.
   H.   If the State permits an MCS provider to self-insure, then the MCS
provider may exercise its right and self-insure as long as the minimal
insurance amounts outlined in this section are met and maintained.
9-28   Performance And Construction/Completion Bond
   A.   An MCS provider shall furnish to the Council/franchising authority, in
an amount totaling at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), a
performance bond or security bond executed by a surety licensed to do business
in this State. The purpose of the performance bond is to ensure performance of
any requirements imposed by this ordinance on an MCS provider. Further, the
purpose is to guarantee that should the MCS provider not fulfill any
obligations imposed by this ordinance (or where applicable a franchise
agreement), then the surety will make whole (to the extent of the policy) any
monetary losses incurred by the City.
   B.   An MCS provider shall furnish to the Council/franchising authority, a
construction/completion bond prior to the time it commences a construction,
upgrade, rebuild, or repair/maintenance project that has a capital construction
cost or outlay exceeding fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in value. The
amount of the bond shall equal at least ninety percent (90%) of the projected
capital construction cost or outlay. The construction/completion bond shall
remain in force at all times, unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule
is detailed in an agreement between the Council/franchising authority, and the
MCS provider.
   C.   The construction/completion bond or security bond shall specifically
guarantee that an MCS provider will timely abide by its construction, upgrade,
rebuild, or repair/maintenance schedule for the multi-channel system and/or any
timetable for technical and service improvements or additions to the multi-
channel system as may be committed to, or agreed upon, from time to time by the
Council/franchising authority and MCS provider.
   D.   If the City draws on a performance or completion bond, or cash deposit,
or letter of credit as a result of an MCS provider's failure to timely
discharge its obligations, or failure to construct and activate the multi-
channel system, or failure to complete a multi-channel system upgrade or
rebuild or repair/maintenance, then the MCS provider shall be required, within
thirty (30) days to replenish the completion and performance bond or security
bond to the minimal level required by the Council/franchising authority.
   E.   Based upon such reasons as the Council/franchising authority might feel
are necessary to protect the public interest, and welfare, the Council/
franchising authority may raise the minimal amount of the performance bond.
   F.   The performance bond or security bond, shall be in force at all times
unless relief is granted or a reduction schedule is detailed in an agreement,
between the MCS provider and the Council/franchising authority.
   G.   In lieu of a performance bond, and construction/completion bond, the
Council/franchising authority may accept a written guarantee of an MCS provider
pledging the full faith and credit of the affected MCS provider should there be
a breach in a material franchise term, or failure to meet any construction
schedule.
9-29   The Council/Franchising Authority's Policy With Respect To Reports And
Records
   A.   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that advances in
technology, and the adoption and application of multi-channel laws, rules,
regulations, and court decisions may have a profound effect and impact on an
MCS provider in any given year.
   B.   Consequently, it is incumbent that the Council/franchising authority
take measures to reduce the risk that multi-channel service or the multi-
channel system will be adversely affected in any given year.
   C.   Therefore, the evaluation of legal, technical, financial, and character
qualifications of an MCS provider is viewed as a constant undertaking on the
part of the City. As a result, the Council/franchising authority requires that
the operator maintain and retain all records and reports necessary for a City/
franchising authority to determine compliance with the obligations imposed on
an MCS provider, and to determine the MCS provider's (legal, technical,
financial, and character) qualifications. The information is primarily intended
to assist the MCS provider to maximize service, rather than to identify
incidents of non-compliance.
9-30   Furnishing Of Reports
   A.   At any time the FCC or another Federal or State agency requires or
requests the submission of reports, data, or other information by a non-exempt
multi-channel service provider, then such MCS provider shall, at the same time,
without a separate or specific request, submit those reports, data, or other
information to the Council/franchising authority. However, unless specifically
authorized by the State, an MCS provider shall not be required to submit state
or federal tax returns, or any information exempted under federal privacy laws,
including Section 631 of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 551).
   B.   With respect to the reports required by this ordinance, it is noted
that a non-exempted MCS provider shall timely submit any required report
including, but not limited to the following:
      1.   an annual compliance statement in the manner set forth in this
ordinance;
      2.   a periodic gross revenue report in the manner set forth in this
ordinance;
      3.   preventative maintenance reports in the manner set forth in this
ordinance;
      4.   copies, if applicable, of the MCS provider's FCC Form 395-A (or
successor form), or any supplemental forms relating to equal employment
opportunity, and fair contracting practices; and
      5.   any other reports or information required by another Section of this
ordinance, or by the Council/franchising authority which are necessary to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City.
9-31   Books And Records
   A.   An MCS provider shall keep complete and accurate books of accounts, and
records of the business and operations under, and in connection with, the MCS
system.
   B.   The Council/franchising authority shall have the right to review
(either by mail or at the MCS provider's local office) all records (pertaining
to an MCS provider's cable and/or multi-channel operations) on seven (7) days
written notice, unless specifically exempted by the Council/franchising
authority. Such review, unless mutually agreed upon, or judicially ordered,
should occur within the MCS provider's regular office hours.
   C.   The Council/franchising authority shall have the right to hire, at its
own expense, an independent certified public accountant, or other business or
financial expert, to review the books and records of an MCS provider. If after
a financial audit it is determined that the MCS provider has underpaid amounts
owed to the City, then the City may require the MCS provider to reimburse the
City for the actual cost of the audit.
   D.   A false entry into the books and/or records of an MCS provider, made by
an MCS provider, of a material and substantial fact shall constitute a material
violation of this ordinance.
   E.   An MCS provider, at the local office shall keep complete and accurate
books and records of the key aspects of the multi-channel system's operation
for at least the preceding three (3) years in such a manner that all matters
pertaining to the City, can be easily produced and/or verified at the City's
request. Also, the MCS provider shall keep, at its local office any other
applicable records and information that may be required by any other Federal or
State agency having jurisdiction over MCS providers.
9-32   Through 9-36 (Reserved)
9-37   Annual Compliance Statement Required
   A.   Within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date that this ordinance
becomes effective, the Council/franchising authority shall develop an MCS
provider's compliance statement in an effort to determine whether such MCS
provider is complying with the various provisions and/or requirements of this
ordinance.
   B.   Prior to December 1, of each calendar year, the City shall furnish to
each MCS provider, a compliance statement.
   C.   Prior to December 31, of each calendar year, each non-exempt MCS
provider shall return to the Council/franchising authority a completed and
executed (by owner or officer) compliance statement.
   D.   There shall be no charge or fee associated with returning the annual
compliance statement. However, if the MCS provider supplies incomplete
information which requires independent verification by the City or a consultant
hired by the City, then the MCS provider may be required to reimburse the City
for all costs associated with the independent verification. Moreover, failure
to submit a statement by the deadline, or the provision of false information
within a statement, may subject an affected MCS provider to any, and all,
penalties and fines listed in this ordinance.
9-38   Notification Of Customers And MCS Providers' Rights And
Responsibilities; General Policy
   A.   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that it is critical that a
customer of an MCS provider fully understands and realizes the rights and
responsibilities of both the customer and MCS provider with respect to the
provision, maintenance, and repair of multi-channel service.
   B.   Further, the Council/franchising authority believes that if sufficient
information is provided to a customer on certain customer service practices
such as rates, billing periods, number and types of services provided, and
rules concerning equipment use and return, then that customer will have the
information necessary to make an informed decision on what, if any, multi-
channel services to subscribe to, and receive.
   C.   In order to provide customers with the variety of information needed to
make an informed decision, and to ensure that customers are notified of their,
and the MCS provider's rights and responsibilities with respect to the multi-
channel system, an MCS provider must provide a customer with a written "Notice
of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and Responsibilities With Respect to
the Provision of Multi-Channel Service."
   D.   The "Notice of a Customer's and MCS Provider's Rights and
Responsibilities With Respect to the Provision of Multi-Channel Service" shall
be provided at the time of initial installation. Thereafter, a subscriber shall
be provided with a written "Notice" at least once every twelve (12) months. If,
however, an MCS provider amends, repeals, adds, deletes, modifies, or makes
other changes to any customer service practice that is required in this
ordinance, then said MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with such written
notification at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such
amendment, repeal, addition, deletion, modification, or other change.
9-39   Notice Of Customer's And MCS Provider's Rights And Responsibilities With

available;
      7.   the customer service office hours and telephone number(s) in a

The "Notice" shall contain no fine print, and any exclusions, limitations, or
caveats shall be clearly indicated as such in the "Notice".
   C.   The "Notice" shall be delivered to a subscriber via an insert in the
subscriber's periodic invoice or through a special mailing.
9-40   Billing Practices
   A.   Within the "Notice" that is required by this ordinance, subscribers
shall be informed of at least the following practices of an MCS provider:
      1.   billing procedures (including payments necessary to avoid
discontinuance of service);

thirty (30) days before such billing practices or payment requirements become
effective.
   E.   In any case where a subscriber requests a cancellation or reduction of
service within thirty (30) days after the notification of a scheduled rate or
charge adjustment, then the subscriber's liability for the newly implemented
rate or charge shall cease from the moment that the rate or charge adjustment
becomes effective.
9-41   Billing Credit Or Refunds For Service Outages, Interruptions;
Substandard Signal Or Picture Quality Or Unsolicited Service
   A.   An MCS provider shall provide a subscriber with credit or a rebate for
a service outage or interruption exceeding eight (8) hours in duration, which
credit, for purposes of determining the amount of the credit or rebate, shall
be deemed to be equivalent to or the same as a twenty-four (24) hour service
outage.
   B.   Where not expressly prohibited by the State, the Council/franchising
authority may prescribe rules for giving credit to a subscriber in cases of
substandard signal or picture quality.
   C.   In the case of a charge for unsolicited service, an MCS provider shall
provide a subscriber with an adjustment or billing credit on the next available
billing statement. Moreover, in such a case, an MCS provider shall not consider
a subscriber delinquent for failure to pay a charge for unsolicited service.
9-42   Prohibition Against Multiple Changes Of Service Tiers Or Service
Clusters Within A 365 Day Period
   A.   To prevent "bait and switch" tactics, and to promote stability with
respect to multi-channel services provided on a multi-channel system, an MCS
provider may not switch any particular multi-channel service from one (1)
service tier or service cluster more than twice during any three hundred sixty
(365) day period.
   B.   Nothing contained in this Section should be construed as mandating any
particular programming service being provided to a subscriber. Nor should this
Section be construed as requiring any particular programming service be
provided on a particular tier or cluster. Rather, this Section is designed to
promote tier or cluster stability, so that a subscriber may choose a tier or
cluster that best suits the subscriber's individual programming and
informational needs.
9-43   Customer Service Hours; Capabilities Of Customer Service Office; And
Telephones
   A.   In order to facilitate the needs of the local customers, an MCS
provider shall maintain a customer service office which is both within the
City, and easily accessible to customers.
   B.   The customer service office shall be open at least forty (40) hours per
week (exclusive of holidays).
   C.   Within the forty (40) hours per week that a customer service office
must be open, an MCS provider must provide office hours either on at least two
(2) evenings (after 5 p.m.), or on Saturdays and/or Sundays (if not prohibited
by State law).
   D.   The customer service office should have an adequate and knowledgeable
staff in order to handle the vast majority of customer service inquiries,
specifically including, but not limited to: billing inquiries, refunds, service
outages, equipment service and repair, payment of bills and other charges, and
inquiries from disabled or physically-impaired customers.
   E.   MCS providers shall for a reasonable charge, provide customers with a
monthly, bi-monthly, or weekly multi-channel programming service guide, listing
and/or detailing the programs and services available during the time period. In
lieu of providing a programming service guide via the mail, or a newspaper, or
third party, the MCS provider may disseminate the information over a channel
designated as a program preview or program listing channel.
   F.   At least annually, any MCS provider shall certify to the Council/
franchising authority that each customer service representative (CSR) has taken
and passed an MCS provider-implemented course designed to train CSRs to handle
their jobs in a courteous, efficient, and responsive manner.
   G.   An MCS provider shall maintain at least one (1) toll-free and/or local
telephone number to accommodate normal business inquiries.
   H.   An MCS provider shall maintain a separate twenty-four (24) hour toll-
free telephone number to facilitate calls concerning repair of equipment and
extended interruption of service. During any hours that the customer service
office is open, the MCS provider must have or make available in-house personnel
to address a customer's inquiries. During other hours, a telephone may be
manned by an automatic answering device, provided that the use of an answering
device or answering service still results in an initial phone call by the MCS
provider within ninety (90) minutes, in order to at least determine the extent
of the outage. The MCS provider shall not be required to make in-person
telephone contacts to subscribers at a rate which exceeds sixty (60) calls per
hour, and shall not be required to make such calls between the hours of 10:00
p.m. and 6:00 a.m. for situations other than reports of service outages.
   I.   A non-exempt MCS provider shall have adequate staff and/or extension
lines (except during special marketing promotion periods, peak billing cycles,
and service outages) in order to handle call to the general information number
to the following specifications:
      1.   Eighty-five percent (85%) of all customer calls received in a year
shall be attended within three minutes by a representative of the MCS provider,
or by a device that is capable of complaint or inquiry resolution; and
      2.   The rate of abandoned calls shall not be greater than fifteen
percent (15%) over any consecutive six (6) month period of time. "Abandoned
calls" shall in no event be deemed to include calls in which the caller hangs
up within forty-five (45) seconds of making the call.
   J.   With respect to the specifications listed in subsection (I) of this
Section, it shall be the MCS provider's responsibility to quarterly certify to
the Council/franchising authority that the affected MCS provider is meeting the
minimal specifications.
9-44   Special Service Requirements For Blind, Hearing-Impaired, Or Ambulatory-
Impaired Customers

or State law, an MCS provider shall comply with the following special service
requirements for blind, hearing-impaired, or ambulatory-impaired customers:
   A.   provide wheelchair accessibility to an MCS provider's customer service
office;
   B.   for any customer declared legally blind by the State, an MCS provider
must provide, if requested by such customer, large type, braille, voice

multi-channel system information;
   C.   provide at a non-discriminatory cost, a special closed-captioned

   E.   where applicable, provide modified or special instructions for use of
equipment by individuals who have physical impairments; and
   F.   in times of a disaster emergency or other instances requiring an
emergency alert, mandating an all channel video blanking capability, so that
all channels would be blanked simultaneously with the audio alert signal, in
order to increase the likelihood that hearing and sight-impaired customers
would be alerted.
9-45   Preferential Or Discriminatory Practices Prohibited
   A.   An MCS provider shall not, as to rules, regulations, rates, charges,
provision of service, or use of a provider's facilities and equipment, make,
allow, or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person, nor subject
any person to prejudice or disadvantage on the basis of age, race, creed,
color, sex, national origin, handicap, religious affiliation or location of
residence.
   B.   Consistent with Section 621 (a) (3) of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 541
(a) (3)), MCS providers classified as cable operators shall not deny cable
service, or the extension of cable service, to any group of potential
residential cable subscribers because of the income of the residents of the
local area in which such group resides.
   C.   Consistent with subsections (A) and (B) of this Section, an MCS
provider shall not provide multi-channel service in a "cherry-picking" or
"cream-skimming" manner or fashion, to the exclusion of other residents based
on the excluded residents' income.
   D.   Subsection (A) of this Section, however, does not prohibit an MCS
provider from offering a promotional or incentive discount rate or charge as
long as the rate or charge does not exceed three hundred seventy (370) days in

physically or electronically) takes place, the following must occur:
      1.   the subscriber must in fact be delinquent in payment of multi-
channel service; and
      2.   at least five (5) days have elapsed after a separate written notice

subscriber's obligation to pay for such service shall cease, or in the case of
a downgrade, a subscriber's obligation to pay for the more comprehensive and/or
higher priced service shall cease.

9-64   Policy With Respect To Continuity Of Multi-Channel Service Provisions
   A.   The Council/franchising authority declares that as part of its right to
establish multi-channel customer service guidelines, it has the duty to ensure
continuity of multi-channel service for all subscribers. In that light, the
Council/franchising authority also determines that it may take appropriate
measures in order to ensure that no portion of the City is threatened or faced
with a disruption, interruption, or discontinuance of multi-channel service due
to the actions of any MCS provider.
   B.   In addition to the principles and ideals enumerated in subsection (A),
the Council/franchising authority also expresses that its policy covers the
following:
      1.   to provide for continuity of multi-channel service in the event of
acquisition by the City;
      2.   to provide for continuity of service in the event of a proposed
abandonment, withdrawal, or cessation of multi-channel service by an MCS
provider;
      3.   to provide for continuity of service in the event of revocation,
termination, or non-renewal of a franchised MCS provider's franchise;
      4.   to provide for continuity of service in the event that a transaction
occurs that affects the ownership or control of the MCS provider, such as an
assignment, sale, transfer, or merger;
      5.   to provide for continuity of service in the event of an expiration
of a franchise;
      6.   to prevent disruption of multi-channel service which would provide a
hardship on those subscribers who rely on a multi-channel system as their
primary or secondary source for information; and
      7.   to prevent the interruption or cessation of multi-channel service
which would disrupt or eliminate the diversity of programming choices enjoyed
by subscribers of a multi-channel system, and thereby restricting their ability
to receive information.
   C.   In any situation (including those mentioned above) which threatens the
City and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the continuity of multi-
channel service, then the MCS provider shall provide the Council/franchising
authority with at least forty-five (45) days notice (except in extreme
circumstances) prior to the effective date of any action which would cause a
loss or interruption in the continuity of multi-channel service. The purpose of
the notice is to apprise the Council/franchising authority of the possibility
of such loss or interruption in the continuity of multi-channel service, so
that it might explore its options and take appropriate measures.
   D.   Whenever any situation occurs (including those mentioned above) which
threatens the City and subscribers with the loss or interruption in the
continuity of multi-channel service, then the Council/franchising authority may
direct the MCS provider for a period of up to twenty-four (24) months to do
everything in its power to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted multi-channel service of the same quality, mix, and level(s)
regardless of the circumstances.
   E.   During the interim period, the Council/franchising authority shall work
with the MCS provider in order to secure a new multi-channel system owner, or
rectify the problem, so that the threat of loss of continuity is removed at the
earliest possible instance.
   F.   During any interim period in which the MCS provider continues to
provide multi-channel service to subscribers, the MCS provider is entitled to
all revenues collected, except any sums owed (including franchise fees,
alternative user charges, and taxes) to the City or to other persons.
   G.   In the event that the threat of loss of continuity is not resolved
within twenty-four (24) months, then the Council/franchising authority may
extend the interim period on a month-to-month basis until the situation is
satisfactorily resolved. Also, in such a circumstance, the Council/franchising
authority may adopt any emergency rules or procedures which will ensure that
the subscribers will receive continuous, uninterrupted multi-channel service of
the same quality, mix, and level(s).
9-65   Continued Use Of Individual Antennas Protected
   A.   The Council/franchising authority does not intend to prohibit the
erection or continued use of individual television antennas within the City so
long as the individual television antennas conform to any and all applicable
zoning and/or land use regulations. Consequently, no person shall be required
to receive multi-channel service, or to physically connect to a multi-channel
system.
   B.   It is also noted that no person shall be penalized or fined (through
either a home sales contract, deed of restrictive covenants, or other type of
agreement) for failing or refusing to receive multi-channel service, or
physically connecting to a multi-channel system.
9-66   Periodic Multi-Channel Subscriber Surveys
   A.   At least every three (3) years after the adoption of this ordinance,
the City and any affected MCS provider shall conduct a survey of current
subscribers of that particular MCS provider in order to ascertain the degree of
customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the subscriber sensitive aspects of
the multi-channel system including (but not limited to) billing practices,
response times, programming choices available and receivable, responsiveness to
inquiries, and use, availability, and accessibility of any customer service
office.
   B.   If the survey results indicate or demonstrate that the customer service
practices set forth in this ordinance are not sufficient to meet reasonable or
identified projected City needs, then the Council/franchising authority may
take whatever measures are appropriate in order to rectify the deficiency or
insufficiency in a particular customer service practice by one or more MCS
providers.
9-67   Through 9-70 (Reserved)
9-71   Construction Schedule And Construction-Related Requirements

contractors of such MCS provider, install cable in the marked-off area.
   6.   An MCS provider shall, on the request of any person holding a building
moving permit, temporarily remove, raise or lower the cable wires to allow the

ordinance, and at the time that an MCS provider rebuilds or upgrades the multi-
channel system, all trunk or feeder cable (coaxial, fiber, or functional
equivalent) shall be placed underground. Further, where both power and
utilities are presently underground, multi-channel system cable shall be placed
underground also.

Public Streets
   1.   This Section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a
franchise to operate within the City.
   2.   Whenever the following occurs:
      1.   a franchised MCS provider ceases to operate all, or part, of the
multi-channel system for a continuous period of six (6) months;
      2.   a franchised MCS provider ceases and fails to construct the multi-

authority may take whatever steps are available under State law to declare the
property surplus, and sell it, with the proceeds of such sale (if permitted by
State law) going to the City.

or private property in as good a condition as before the work causing the
disturbance was done.

channel system shall comply with the most current editions of the National
Electrical Safety Code, and the National Electric Code, as affects the
construction, installation, and maintenance of electrical supply and
communication lines and attachments and supports. To the extent that these are
inconsistent with other provisions of a franchise, or State, or local law, then
the more stringent shall govern in order to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare.
   2.   All installations shall treat the aesthetics of the property as a
priority, shall not substantially affect the appearance of the structure, and
shall not be installed on the bias across property or the face or side of a
home or building without the owner's permission.
   3.   No home/building within 150 feet of the system shall be served by a
drop with any pole span being longer than 150 feet without the owner's
permission.
   4.   All underground drops shall follow property lines and cross property
only at right angles, unless otherwise permitted by the owner.
9-76   System Construction Schedule For Franchised MCS Providers
   1.   This Section is applicable to any MCS provider required to maintain a
franchise to operate with the City.
   2.   A franchised MCS provider's construction schedule for the multi-channel
system shall be detailed in the franchise agreement in a form and format
determined by the Council/franchising authority.
   3.   A franchised MCS provider who does not abide by the system construction
schedule shall be handled in the manner allowed under either this ordinance, or
where applicable, a franchise agreement.
9-77   System Expansion For MCS Providers
   1.   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that one of its primary
purposes in the franchising process is to ensure that the widest diversity of
programming sources be available to the greatest number of City residents. The
Council/franchising authority is also cognizant that an MCS provider may have
some constitutionally protected rights with respect to when and what areas of
the City are provided service.
   2.   In order to balance those interests, the Council/franchising authority
sets the minimum guidelines for any system expansion on the part of a
franchised MCS provider.
   3.   A franchised MCS provider shall submit, within six (6) months of the
effective date of this ordinance, a detailed plan for multi-channel system
expansion to any area not presently served within the City. Provided, however,
no such plan shall be accepted by the Council/franchising authority as to any
area less than the entire City limits if a non-exempt MCS provider has already
submitted such a plan as part of a franchise. Such plan should not be construed
as a requirement for universal service, but rather as a means for achieving the
Council/franchising authority's goals, mentioned in Subsection (A). However, at
a minimum, a franchised MCS provider shall extend multi-channel service to any
area within the City that has a density of ten (10) homes or building passings
per mile, or fractional equivalent thereof, as measured from the extremity of
the system nearest the unserved area. Also, in such a case, a newly installed
subscriber shall not be assessed or apportioned the cost for installation,
except for the usual and normal connection fees paid by subscribers, so long as
the system expansion is technically feasible.
   4.   The detailed plan must include criteria for:
      1.   extending the provision of service to isolated subscribers;
      2.   extending the provision of service to new or existing developments
with overhead cable construction; and
      3.   new or existing developments with underground cable construction.
   5.   The detailed plan must be reviewed and approved by the Council/
franchising authority.
   6.   For purposes of this Section, "isolated subscribers'" means any
potential customer of a franchised MCS provider who dwells in a house more than
one-half (1/2) mile from the nearest franchised MCS provider connection.
9-78   Permits And Licenses
An MCS provider shall obtain, at its own expense, all permits and licenses
required by law, rule, regulation, or ordinance, and maintain the same, in full
force and effect, for as long as required.
9-79   Through 9-85 (Reserved)
9-86   Council/Franchising Authority's Policy With Respect To Safety
Requirements
   A.   The Council/franchising authority requires that the MCS provider's
construction, operation, and maintenance of the multi-channel system meet
certain threshold safety levels which are designed to protect the public and
lessen the likelihood of interruption of multi-channel service.
   B.   Consequently, the Council/franchising authority requires any non-exempt
MCS provider to adopt the following safety requirements:
      1.   emergency alert override activation in the manner set forth in this
ordinance;
      2.   minimum standby power as noted in this ordinance;
      3.   the provision of an indoor signal or safety alert technology in the
manner noted in this ordinance;
      4.   implementing a periodic preventative maintenance program as set
forth in this ordinance;
      5.   follow all FCC rules and regulations concerning maximum cumulative
leakage index (CLI) limits; and
      6.   comply with, and abide by, any construction, safety or fire codes as
noted in this ordinance.
9-87   Provisions To Alert Subscribers In The Event Of An Emergency; Standby
Power
   A.   In order that subscribers may be alerted in the event of an impending,
imminent or actual, natural or man-made emergency, then all MCS providers shall
ensure that the multi-channel system providing multi-channel service to all, or
part, of the City is designed so as to permit an authorized official of the
City to override the audio portion of all channels, by touch-tone phone (or
functional equivalent) from any location.
   B.   In addition to any other requirements listed in this Section, an MCS
provider shall:
      1.   designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of
both audio and video;
      2.   inform subscribers of the designated emergency channel at least
daily on at least one (1) channel of the multi-channel system;
      3.   maintain all channel video blanking capability to facilitate the
needs of hearing and sight-impaired customers;
      4.   test the emergency override system not less than once a month;
      5.   cooperate with the City on the use and operation of the emergency
alert override system; and
      6.   develop a plan (with the City's concurrence) in order to provide
continuity of multi-channel service, and response to service calls in the event
of a natural or man-made emergency.
   C.   As one method of providing continuity of multi-channel services in the
event of a natural or man-made emergency, an MCS provider shall, unless
exempted by the Council/franchising authority, have the capacity for four (4)
hour automatically activated standby power on all trunk and feeder cable, and
all headends, hubs, and receive sites associated with the distribution of cable
service to, and throughout the City.
9-88   Provisions Concerning Safety Alert Technology
   A.   The Council/franchising authority considers the need for an indoor
signal or safety alert technology, available to both subscribers and non-
subscribers of an MCS provider's lowest level of programming service, of
paramount interest and need, and as such should be an integral part of an MCS
provider's system. Though in some ways similar to the concept of emergency
alert override, signal alert technology is different and distinct in that it
may be used by both subscribers to basic service and non-subscribers to the
basic service of an MCS provider's system. Moreover, such safety alert
technology is connected to the National Weather Service twenty-four (24) hour
radio service including its new WRSAME/"Site Select" weather and warning
system, which specifically allows for an indoor warning and notification via an
audio alert voice path, regardless of whether an individual has a television
receiver or monitor, or an FM receiver, and, moreover, can provide effectively
instantaneous alert and warning, as well as needed instructions, in addition to
allowing key community-oriented entities to communicate with both the general
populace and selected (i.e. target) segments of the community.
   B.   In realization and recognition of the preceding, a non-exempt MCS
provider shall offer for use throughout the City (within twelve (12) months of
the effective date of this ordinance) a signal or safety alert monitoring
technology for purposes of alerting both subscribers and non-subscribers of a
multi-channel system to impending or occurring disaster emergencies, and
allowing the City to communicate with both subscribers and the public as the
need to do so may exist at any time.
   C.   A non-exempt MCS provider shall cooperate with the City and the
provider of said technology in the marketing and distribution of the necessary
on-premises alert receiving devices, including the installation, and
replacement of such, as may be needed from time to time.
   D.   A non-exempt MCS provider shall install the necessary electronics,
processing, and distribution equipment in the MCS provider's headend, and will
ensure the maintenance, operating condition, and replacement of such equipment,
as is necessary to protect its continued use.
   E.   Notwithstanding the preceding, a non-exempt MCS provider has no
responsibility for repair of such equipment beyond obtaining (in a timely
manner) replacement from the manufacturer for inoperable components.
   F.   It is explicitly understood that one need not be a subscriber to a
multi-channel system to use the safety alert device, and receive the safety
alert service, so long as a drop is installed into the address to which said
device is attached. It is also understood that the user need not have a
television receiver.
   G.   The Council/franchising authority recognizes the positive effect on the
safety of the public in general, and the ability to save lives, and property,
of those who would otherwise be prevented from receiving the most expeditious
warning or alert possible without such a device and technology. Consequently,
the Council/franchising authority requires that all non-exempt MCS providers
shall participate in a periodic public awareness campaign as deemed appropriate
by the Council/franchising authority, in cooperation with the Council/
franchising authority and the manufacturer, to inform the citizenry and non-
cable subscribers of the availability and capability of such safety alert
technology.
   H.   An MCS provider shall assure that all subscribers to multi-channel
service receive printed material, fully describing the technology and its
benefits, at least annually and at the time of installation.
   I.   An MCS provider shall allow non-subscribers of Basic Cable Service the
choice of purchasing or leasing the necessary equipment, which shall include
the cost of installation on a non-discriminatory basis, and so inform such
persons of both options.
   J.   Given the significant public safety and life and property saving
benefits of this technology, and the resultant need of as much of the general
public as possible to be protected from the otherwise unnecessary greater risk
to life, limb and property associated with other alert/warning systems, an MCS
provider shall assure that the service is placed on the same level of service
and is priced commensurate with that for like technology/service in the Mid-
Western United States.
   K.   Given the importance and critical nature of preventing the loss of life
and property, and the need and ability of the Council/franchising authority to
communicate directly with the public in any number of situations, including but
not limited to those potentially involving matters of life and death, and as
this technology is clearly not a programming service, the Council/franchising
authority deems it appropriate to designate the use of the capability of such
technology as a governmental use of the system, and it is the intent of the
City that it be made available to all subscribers.
9-89   Implementation Of A Preventative Maintenance Program
   A.   It shall be the duty of an MCS provider (that has more than three
hundred fifty subscribers) to devise and implement a quarterly preventative
maintenance program for the multi-channel system in order to ensure that there
is no material degradation of the multi-channel system that would affect the
citizens' health, safety, and welfare, or negatively affect the quality of
multi-channel services being provided.
   B.   Before the MCS provider implements such a program, it shall be reviewed
and approved by the Council/franchising authority. Within forty-five (45) days
after the completion of the quarterly preventative maintenance program, the MCS
provider shall prepare and submit a written report to the Council/franchising
authority detailing the results of the tests conducted, and all items performed
or addressed during the quarterly program. Although not exhaustive, the
following areas should be included in a preventative maintenance program, and
subsequent report:
      1.   inspection, and repair if needed, of the headend;
      2.   inspection, and repair if needed, of the antenna tower;
      3.   requiring weather-proofing and protection of the antenna lead
connectors, and on any other exposed fittings;
      4.   requiring the conducting of signal leakage tests that are in
accordance with FCC requirements;
      5.   removing tree roots, limbs, and branches that interfere with, or
come in contact with, the MCS provider's cable;
      6.   requiring the periodic servicing, testing, and calibration of the
MCS provider's equipment including equipment on service vehicles, and field
test equipment;
      7.   employing a status monitoring system to identify problems or
situations in which the multi-channel system electronics are operating outside
pre-programmed parameters;
      8.   testing of the emergency alert system to ensure that it will
function properly during an emergency situation; and
      9.   testing of the safety alert system or technology.
9-90   Construction, Fire, And Safety Codes
   A.   An MCS provider shall construct, operate, maintain, repair, remove,
replace, or restore the multi-channel system in strict compliance with all
current technical codes adopted by the Council/franchising authority, the
State, or the United States.
   B.   The codes referred to specifically include, but are not limited to,
construction, fire and safety, and zoning codes.
9-91   Through 9-95 (Reserved)
9-96   Alternative User Charge
   A.   This Section is applicable to any unfranchised, but otherwise
authorized MCS provider, and to any MCS provider who has had its franchise
ruled unconstitutional, unenforceable, or invalid. For all franchised MCS
providers the provisions concerning franchise fees shall be applicable.
   B.   Where not specifically prohibited by Federal or State law, and as an
alternative to the imposition of a franchise fee as set forth in this
ordinance, the Council/franchising authority may impose, extract, and collect,
a charge from an affected MCS provider for the use by such provider of the
streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways of the City.
   C.   The alternative user charge shall be based on the following
mathematical mode:
      1.   determine the present value of all public streets, rights-of-way,
easements, and public ways of the City in which are located multi-channel
system facilities and equipment of the affected MCS provider;
      2.   take the average percentage increase in land appraisals within the
City (as determined by the Property Appraiser for the City, for the five
preceding years);
      3.   take the average percentage increase for the five preceding years
and use it to determine the dollar amount of property value increase for the
remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable, then use five
years);
      4.   add the present value to the dollar amount of property value
increase for the remaining term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable
then use five years);
      5.   divide the adjusted value by the remaining number of years on the
term of the franchise (if no franchise applicable then use five years);
      6.   multiply that figure by five percent (5%) to arrive at the annual
user charge that is to be collected from the affected MCS provider.
For purposes of illustration only, the formula reads as follows:
present value = the dollar amount of the property value increase for remaining
term of the franchise (based on average percentage increase of land appraisals
for past years of franchise term; divide the adjusted present value by the
remaining years on the term of the franchise; multiply that figure by five
percent (5%), = (equals) the annual alternative user charge.
   D.   The Council/franchising authority adopts such an alternative user
charge in order to receive fair compensation for the affected MCS provider's
use of the public streets and public ways if such compensation cannot be
obtained by imposing a flat percentage fee on such MCS provider's annual gross
revenues. However, an affected MCS provider may agree to an alternative charge
that is based on a flat percentage of gross revenues, as long as that charge
did not exceed the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was
assessed as a franchise fee calculated as a percentage of an affected MCS
provider's annual gross revenues.
   E.   It is expressly understood that a franchise fee and an alternative user
charge will not be imposed on the same MCS provider at the same time, for the
same period.
   F.   An affected MCS provider shall at no time be charged or obligated to
pay an alternative user charge that exceeds the maximum amount previously
allowed under law that was assessed as a franchise fee calculated as a
percentage of such MCS provider's gross revenues (as defined by this ordinance)
for any particular reporting period. In the event that the alternative user
charge does exceed the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was
assessed as a franchise fee and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues,
then such alternative user charge should be reduced to reflect an amount not
greater than the maximum amount previously allowed under law that was assessed
as a franchise fee and calculated as a percentage of gross revenues.
   G.   An affected MCS provider shall pay twenty-five percent (25%) of the
alternative user charge at the end of every three (3) months.
9-97   Franchise Required; Exception
   A.   Except as provided in subsections (B), (C), and (D) of this Section, no
person, or MCS provider shall be permitted to construct, operate or maintain a
multi-channel system which requires the laying or positioning of cable
(coaxial, fiber or functional equivalent) across the rights-of-way of the City,
without having first obtained a franchise, and then entering into a franchise
agreement with the City.
   B.   Pursuant to the CCPA, a local government may own and operate a multi-
channel system classified as a cable system. Consequently, should the Council/
franchising authority directly, or indirectly, through any legal means
available to the Council/franchising authority, decide to purchase, acquire,
construct, lease, control, or otherwise own a cable system within the
territorial limits of the City, then the Council/franchising authority shall
not be required to submit a proposal for, or receive, a franchise in order to
construct, operate, and maintain a cable system within the geographical limits
of the City.
   C.   In the case of a person or MCS provider lawfully providing multi-
channel service on July 1, 1984, then such person or MCS provider shall not be
required to obtain a franchise, and enter into a franchise agreement unless the
Council/franchising authority expressly requires the person or MCS provider to
do so.
   D.   If, as a result of annexation (either previous to, or subsequent to,
the effect date of this ordinance), an MCS provider comes under the
jurisdiction of the City, then such MCS provider shall be subject to the
provisions of this ordinance, including (if applicable) obtaining a franchise.
Any such franchise shall extend only to the territory comprising the annexed
area. The provisions of Section
9-10 and
9-15 of this ordinance do not apply to this subsection.
   E.   Where a person or MCS provider is required by the Council/franchising
authority to obtain a franchise, then the Council/franchising authority shall
notify the person or MCS provider, in writing, within thirty (30) days of the
Council/franchising authority's formal action.
   F.   After receipt of notification, the affected person or MCS provider has
ninety (90) days to submit an application or proposal in substantially the same
form and format as required by the Council/franchising authority. Then, the
affected person or MCS provider's application will be handled as set forth by
either State or local law.
9-98   Authority To Grant Non-Exclusive Franchises
   A.   Consistent with Section 621(a)(1) of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 541),
the Council/franchising authority may award one (1) or more non-exclusive
multi-channel service franchises within its geographical limits. With the
exception of existing non-exempt MCS providers in an area annexed by the City
and subject to Section
9-77 of this ordinance, the Council/franchising authority shall not award a
franchise for a service area comprising less than the entire City limits. Note
well, however, that existing non-exempt MCS providers as of the effective date
of this ordinance may, but are not required to, serve any subsequently annexed
area of the City in a manner consistent with line extension policies outlined
in this ordinance, and which are specifically noted in the MCS provider's
franchise agreement. The provisions of Section
9-10 and
9-15 of this ordinance do not apply to this subsection.
   B.   A franchised MCS provider shall be selected as part of a public
proceeding and hearing which affords due process to both the City and the
applicant, and after which, if the applicant is selected as a franchised MCS
provider, then such applicant will enter into a franchise agreement with the
City, pursuant to the provisions of federal, state, and local laws and
regulations.
9-99   Franchise Agreement; Minimal Requirements
   A.   If the Council/franchising authority awards an applicant a franchise to
construct, operate, or maintain a multi-channel system within the City, or
approves a proposal for a renewal of a franchise, then within one hundred
eighty (180) days, an applicant or a renewal franchised MCS provider and the
City shall enter into a franchise agreement which details the rights, duties,
responsibilities, and liabilities of both parties.
   B.   A newly franchised MCS provider may not lay any cable (coaxial, fiber,
or functional equivalent) until the franchise agreement is executed by both the
newly franchised MCS provider and the Council/franchising authority.
   C.   A franchise agreement shall be in sufficient detail in order to clearly
delineate the rights and duties of the franchised MCS provider, and the
Council/franchising authority.
   D.   At a minimum, a franchise agreement shall contain provisions for the
following:
      1.   a detailed definition of "annual gross revenues" or "gross revenues"
which specifically includes an explanation of what constitutes the revenue base
for determining what revenues are subject to any franchise fee or alternative
user charge;
      2.   the term or duration of the franchise;
      3.   indemnity and hold harmless clauses;
      4.   insurance;
      5.   performance and completion bonds or security deposits;
      6.   construction, upgrade or rebuild schedule;
      7.   franchise fees;
      8.   continuity of multi-channel programming service;
      9.   repeal of prior inconsistent franchise agreements; and
      10.   a severability clause.
9-100   Extent Of Grant Of Franchise
   A.   Upon an award of a franchise, and the subsequent execution of the
franchise agreement, an MCS provider required to obtain and maintain a
franchise may construct, erect, install, maintain, operate, repair, replace,
remove, or restore a multi-channel system within the geographical limits set
forth in the franchise agreement.
   B.   The franchised multi-channel system may be located in, upon, along,
across, over, and under the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and public ways
of the City.
   C.   If necessary, the responsibility of obtaining easements for private
property (including privately owned utility or street light poles) shall be
that of a franchised MCS provider.
   D.   A franchised MCS provider, through a separate pole or utility easement
agreement with an affected utility, may locate the multi-channel system on, or
within, the property of such utility company. This provision specifically
includes MCS providers classified as cable operators.
9-101   Term Of Franchise
   A.   The term of an initial renewal franchise may be for a period not to
exceed fifteen (15) years from the date that a franchise renewal agreement is
approved by the Council/franchising authority.
   B.   If an initial franchise or renewal franchise is for a period of six (6)
years or less, then the franchise agreement shall detail the reasons for
granting the shorter franchise term.
   C.   The reasons for a franchise term of six (6) years or less, include, and
are limited to, the following:
      1.   multiple or repeated violations of the prior franchise agreement;
      2.   multiple or repeated violations of this ordinance, or any mandated
provisions of the CCPA;
      3.   a continuing and documented pattern of substandard or non-responsive
service;
      4.   reckless disregard for the safety and welfare of the citizens of the
City;
      5.   failure to comply with any construction, rebuild, or upgrade
schedule; and
      6.   failure to timely pay in their entirety any franchise fees, or
taxes, or other charges due to the City.
   D.   The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to grant a
franchised MCS provider a variable franchise term wherein the initial or
renewal term may be extended by up to two (2) years (not to exceed fifteen (15)
years total) upon the franchised MCS provider attaining an "excellent" rating
during the course of a periodic performance evaluation.
   E.   The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to grant a
franchised MCS provider a variable franchise term (wherein the initial or
renewal term may be extended by up to two (2) years (not to exceed fifteen (15)
years total) should the franchised MCS provider consistently and continually
meet the Council/franchising authority's objectives with respect to the
provision of broad categories of video programming as noted in this ordinance.
   F.   The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to reduce the term
of the franchise by one (1) year for each material, repeated occurrence of an
uncured/unremedied violation of the franchise or this ordinance, pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section
9-105 of this ordinance, or when the MCS provider fails to attain a minimum
rating of "adequate" (on a scale of "excellent", "adequate" and "poor") for any
two (2) successive periodic performance reviews, as set forth in Section
9-106 of this ordinance.
   G.   Should the highest court of the nation, or State, invalidate, void as
unenforceable or unconstitutional, the concept of a franchise or franchise
duration, then the Council/franchising authority may adopt emergency rules and
regulations in order to preserve and protect the rights and duties of both the
Council/franchising authority and any franchised MCS provider. During the
interim, the invalid franchise may be considered (unless prohibited by the
State) and interpreted in the same manner and fashion as a business license or
other comparable authorization. Upon the adoption of emergency rules, the
Council/franchising authority should enter into a new agreement which describes
which terms and conditions of the franchised MCS provider's system may be
reviewed and examined, and under what circumstances may a franchised MCS
provider forfeit its right to operate a multi-channel system within the City.
9-102   Application For Franchise; Application Fee
   A.   The Council/franchising authority may develop rules and regulations
with respect to the submission and processing of applications for a franchise.
Such rules and regulations shall primarily be aimed at determining the legal,
financial, technical, and character qualifications of the applicant.
   B.   Unless prohibited, an applicant shall pay an application fee which
shall be equal to the administrative and consulting costs associated with
processing an application for a franchise. The total application fee must be
paid, unless waived, regardless of whether the applicant receives, or does not
receive a franchise. The total application fee must be paid (or waived) prior
to the Council/franchising authority's formal action on the applicant's request
for a franchise.
9-103   Franchise Fees
   A.   Any non-exempt franchised MCS provider (specifically including any MCS
provider classified as a cable operator) awarded a franchise or renewal
franchise after the date this ordinance becomes effective, shall pay to the
City for the privilege and use of the streets, rights-of-way, easements, and
public ways, and other facilities of the City in the operation of the multi-
channel system, and for the City's supervision thereof during the term of the
franchise, a sum equal to five percent to (5%) of the annual gross revenues of
such non-exempt franchised MCS provider. Such fee shall explicitly be separate
from, and in addition to, any fees or charges for the use or occupancy of any
municipally-owned poles, conduits or other facilities owned by a municipally-
owned utility.
   B.   If the FCC, Congress or other governmental entity with authority over
multi-channel service ever allows a governmental entity or Council/franchising
authority to increase the franchise fee beyond five percent (5%), then the
Council/franchising authority shall have the authority to increase the
franchise fee to the maximum rate allowable.
   C.   It is intended that the franchise fees will promote the health, safety,
and welfare of the citizens of the City. Therefore, the five percent (5%)
franchise fee shall be deposited into the general revenues of the City, unless
specifically authorized elsewhere.
   D.   A non-exempt franchised MCS provider shall file with the Council/
franchising authority, within forty-five (45) days after the expiration of each
of the franchised MCS provider's fiscal quarters, a detailed financial and
revenue report clearly showing the gross revenues received by such franchised
MCS provider during the preceding quarter and certified by a certified public
accountant or officer of a franchised MCS provider attesting to the accuracy,
completeness, and veracity of the revenue figures. Such report shall be in the
form and format determined by the Council/franchising authority. Such report
shall include revenue from whatever source, directly or indirectly derived
from, or allowed, or caused to be derived from, or applicable to the operation
of the multi-channel system, or the provision of any multi-channel service by
or to the multi-channel system. Revenue will be reported by service category,
type, and level showing computations and using incremental billing rates for
all sources, levels, tiers, and types of service and other revenue sources of
all kinds and types.
   E.   Payment of the quarterly portion of the franchise fee shall be rendered
to the City at the time the revenue report is filed.
   F.   In the event that payment is not made within forty-five (45) days after
the date specified in this Section, then such franchised MCS provider may be
declared in default of the franchise, and the franchise may be revoked,
terminated, or canceled in the manner prescribed by this ordinance.
   G.   The Council/franchising authority reserves the right to audit a
franchised MCS provider books, if the Council/franchising authority deems it
necessary. If such audit discovers an underpayment of franchise fees that
exceeds two percent (2%) of the total fee paid for any reporting quarter, then
the affected franchised MCS provider shall reimburse the City for the cost of
such an audit. It is specifically understood that the right of audit and
recomputation of any, and all, amounts paid under a franchise fee, shall always
be accorded to the Council/franchising authority.
   H.   All annual reports due and pertaining to the payment of franchise fees,
will be certified by an officer of the franchised MCS provider, and such
provider shall maintain records used in the preparation of said report, to be
produced in their originality and totality upon request or demand by the
Council/franchising authority.
   I.   No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release of, or an
accord, or satisfaction of, any claim that the City might have for further or
additional sums payable under the terms of this ordinance, or for any other
performance or obligation of a franchised MCS provider hereunder.
   J.   Payments of compensation made by a franchised MCS provider to the City,
pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance, shall be considered in addition
to, and exclusive of, any and all authorized taxes, business license fees,
other fees, other levies or assessments presently in effect, or subsequently
adopted.
   K.   A franchise fee does not include any items excluded by Section 622 (g)
(2) (D) of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 542 (g) (2) (D)).
   L.   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the authority of
the Council/franchising authority to impose a tax, fee or other assessment of
any kind, on any person (other than a franchised MCS provider) with respect to
multi-channel service or other programming or communications service provided
by such person over a multi-channel system for which charges are assessed to
subscribers, but not received by a franchised MCS provider. For purposes of
illustration only, this subsection shall include the situation(s) where a
premium service directly bills a subscriber, or the franchised MCS provider
merely acts as collection agent for a premium service billing directly to a
subscriber, or where a person leases a channel for commercial use and sells
advertising or goods on that channel, and receives the money directly or
through a third party.
   M.   For any twelve (12) month period, the fees paid by any person subject
to subsection (L) who provides any such multi-channel service shall not exceed
five percent (5%) of such person's gross revenues derived in such period from
the provision of such service over the multi-channel system.
   N.   If at any time, the highest court of the nation, or the highest court
of the State, invalidates, voids, or rules as unconstitutional the concept of
franchise fees, then the Council/franchising authority may impose an
alternative user charge on the franchised MCS provider, in the manner set forth
in this ordinance.
9-104   Assignment Or Transfer Of Franchise
   A.   Where required for operation, an MCS provider's franchise may not be
assigned or transferred in whole, or in part, by the affected MCS provider,
without the prior express written approval by the Council/franchising
authority.
   B.   Any attempted assignment or transfer without such prior written consent
shall constitute a default of such franchise.
   C.   In the event of such a default, the Council/franchising authority shall
proceed according to the procedure set forth in this ordinance, and any
applicable State law.
   D.   At least ninety (90) days before a proposed assignment or transfer of
an MCS provider's franchise is scheduled to become effective, such franchised
MCS provider shall petition in writing for the Council/franchising authority's
written consent for such a proposed assignment or transfer.
   E.   The Council/franchising authority will not unreasonably withhold its
consent to such an assignment or transfer. However, in making such a
determination, the Council/franchising authority may consider the following:
      1.   experience of proposed assignee or transferee (including conducting
an investigation of proposed assignee or transferee's service record in other
communities);
      2.   qualifications of proposed assignee or transferee;
      3.   legal integrity of proposed assignee or transferee;
      4.   financial ability and stability of the proposed assignee or
transferee;
      5.   if requested by the Council/franchising authority, submittals from
the proposed assignee or transferee, on what, if any, changes it intends to
make in the operation and maintenance of the present multi-channel system;
      6.   the corporate connection, if any, between the franchised MCS
provider, and proposed assignee or transferee;
      7.   the economic viability or non-viability of the multi-channel system
in the future, based upon certain factors including the impact of the purchase
price on the City and/or the proposed assignee or transferee; and
      8.   any other legitimate aspect of the proposed assignee's or
transferee's background which could affect the health, safety, and welfare of
the citizenry of City as it relates to the operation of the multi-channel
system.
   F.   A copy of the completed sales agreement, or a functionally equivalent
instrument, between the franchised MCS provider and proposed assignee or
transferee shall be provided to the Council/franchising authority, so that the
Council/franchising authority may discover the assumption of obligations by the
franchised MCS provider and proposed assignee or transferee with respect to the
multi-channel system. In lieu of the sales agreement, the Council/franchising
authority may accept an attested summary of obligations assumed by the above
referenced parties.
   G.   Before an assignment or transfer is approved by the Council/franchising
authority, the proposed assignee or transferee shall execute an affidavit,
acknowledging that it has read, understood, and intends to abide by both this
ordinance, and the applicable franchise agreement.
   H.   In the event of any approved assignment or transfer, the assignee or
transferee shall assume all obligations and liabilities of the former
franchised MCS provider, except as noted in subsection (I).
   I.   An assignment or transfer shall not relieve the former franchised MCS
provider of its liabilities under the franchise agreement until the assignment
actually takes place, or unless specifically relieved by Federal, or State law,
or unless specifically relieved by the Council/franchising authority at the
time an assignment or transfer is approved.
9-105   Default Of Franchise; Revocation, Termination Or Cancellation Of
Franchise
   A.   When any event, act or omission (on the part of the franchised MCS
provider) occurs which represents a violation of an integral provision of this
ordinance, or compromises the corporate character, or legal, financial or
technical integrity and/or stability of the multi-channel system or the
franchised MCS provider to such a degree that the interests of the subscribers
and users are negatively affected, then such event, act or omission may be
considered a major breach of this ordinance. Under such circumstances, the
Council/franchising authority shall notify the affected MCS provider in
writing, of the specific breach, and direct such franchised MCS provider to
comply with all such provisions of its proposal, franchise agreement, or this
ordinance.
   B.   For illustrative purposes only, the events, acts and omissions include,
but are not limited to: bankruptcy, insolvency, failure to pay taxes or
franchise fees (including the alternative user charge if applicable), failure
to receive written Council/franchising authority approval for an assignment or
transfer, or failure to abide by the integral terms and conditions of the
franchise agreement, or integral provisions of this ordinance.
   C.   Where a franchised MCS provider satisfactorily corrects any of the
enumerated conditions, within sixty (60) days, then in no event shall the
enumerated condition be weighed against such franchised MCS provider in any
subsequent review of franchise performance.
   D.   A copy of such notice of material breach shall be mailed to the surety
on the performance bond.
   E.   Within seventy-five (75) days, after such written notice is mailed to a
franchised MCS provider, the Council/franchising authority shall conduct a
public hearing on the matter.
   F.   The Council/franchising authority shall provide written notice to a
franchised MCS provider, and the surety, of the time and place of said public
hearing in a manner consistent with either State law, or approved by the
Council/franchising authority.
   G.   At the time of the hearing, the affected franchised MCS provider may
present information on the current status of the alleged breach of the
franchise agreement. If the situation has been resolved, or steps are being
taken to resolve the situation, then the franchised MCS provider should present
the information at the hearing.
   H.   If the affected franchised MCS provider fails to attend the hearing,
and has not requested a continuance of the hearing, then such franchised MCS
provider shall be deemed to have waived its right to a further continuation of
the matter, and may be declared in default of the franchise agreement.
   I.   After the public hearing, the Council/franchising authority may
determine the franchised MCS provider to be in compliance and dismiss the
matter, or may determine that the MCS provider has cured any non-compliance and
thereby dismiss the matter. However the Council/franchising authority may
determine that an ordinance violation exists and remains uncured. Consequently,
upon a finding that the MCS provider violated an integral ordinance provision,
or failed to cure an outstanding ordinance violation, the Council/franchising
authority may direct the affected franchised MCS provider to take corrective
action within a specified period of time, or may declare such franchised MCS
provider in default of the franchise agreement, and thereafter may revoke,
terminate, or cancel the franchise, unless the franchised MCS provider presents
sufficient mitigating circumstances.
   J.   If the Council/franchising authority directs corrective action to take
place within a specified time or declares such franchised MCS provider in
default of the franchise agreement, then that declaration shall be reduced to
writing, and the notice of corrective action or default shall be mailed to such
franchised MCS provider, and surety, within fifteen (15) days of the Council/
franchising authority's action.
   K.   If within forty-five (45) days, the affected franchised MCS provider,
or surety does not take significant action to rectify the breach, or submit a
plan detailing how the affected MCS provider will eliminate the breach, then
the Council/franchising authority shall revoke such MCS provider's franchise,
and shall notify the affected franchised MCS provider, and surety forthwith,
unless there are mitigating circumstances.
9-106   Performance Evaluations
The Council/franchising authority is authorized to design a performance
evaluation procedure which periodically monitors compliance of the franchised
MCS provider with the terms and conditions of both the franchise and this
ordinance. Moreover, the Council/franchising authority may periodically review,
and examine whether a franchised MCS provider's financial, technical, legal,
and character qualifications continue to meet required operational,
maintenance, and performance levels in order to ensure the uninterrupted
provision of multi-channel services. Such performance evaluations may be
conducted every three (3) years during the franchise term, and may done as part
of any required survey.
9-107   Through 9-115 (Reserved)
9-116   Specific Additional Rules For MCS Providers Classified As Cable
Operators
   A.   In addition to any requirements contained within this ordinance, all
non-exempt MCS providers that are classified as cable operators shall be
expected to abide by, and comply with, all applicable provisions of the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984.
   B.   The specific provisions of the CCPA include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      1.   cable channels for public, educational, or governmental use (Section
611 CCPA--codified at 47 USC 531);
      2.   cable channels for commercial use (Section 612--47 USC 532);
      3.   general franchise requirements (Section 621--47 USC 541);
      4.   franchise fees (Section 622--47 USC 542);
      5.   regulation of rates (Section 623--47 USC 543);
      6.   regulation of services, facilities, and equipment (Section 624--47
USC 544);
      7.   modification of franchise obligations (Section 625--47 USC 545);
      8.   franchise renewal (Section 626--47 USC 546);
      9.   conditions of sale of a franchise (Section 627--47 USC 547);
      10.   subscriber privacy (Section 631--47 USC 551); and
      11.   equal employment opportunity (Section 634--47 USC 554).
   C.   Further, as an additional requirement, before the second anniversary of
the effective date of this ordinance, any non-exempt MCS provider classified as
a cable operator and providing cable service within the City shall have
designed, built and activated a multi-channel system with a channel capacity of
at least sixty (60) channels.
   D.   Further, the Council/franchising authority is committed that the goal
of the CCPA, as set forth in Section 601(4) of the Act (codified at 47 USC 521
(4)), is met at all times. As a result, the Council/franchising authority
expressly requires that upon the advent, implementation, and transmission of
high definition television (HDTV), its functional equivalent, or any
subsequently developed technological advancement affecting channel capacity or
needed bandwidth for any video programming source or service, the cable
operator shall not lessen, dilute, or decrease the mix, level, quality, or
quantity of programming services carried on the cable system for reasons of
lack of adequate channel capacity.
   E.   Additionally, the Council/franchising authority, in the interests of
minimizing on-going operating costs to the cable operator and the resultant
increases in rates and charges paid by subscribers is committed to the
introduction of technological advancements that could realize such benefits to
both the cable operator and subscriber. Therefore, unless an operator can
demonstrate that it is both technologically and economically unfeasible, the
affected cable operator shall within eighteen (18) months of the effective date
of a franchise renewal agreement, or at the time of initial construction under
a new franchise agreement, introduce addressable technology allowing cable
service levels to be changed without the expense (either to the operator or
subscriber) of a separate trip or call.
9-117   Specific Additional Public, Educational, And Governmental Rules For MCS
Providers Classified As Cable Operators
   A.   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that under Section 611 of
the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 531), the Council/franchising authority has
certain power with respect to certain aspects for public, educational, or
governmental (PEG) use that is provided by MCS providers classified as cable
operators.
   B.   To the extent permitted by law, and in order to fulfill the Council/
franchising authority's desired goal of a public, educational, and governmental
(PEG) access policy that will facilitate the long-range needs of the City, the
Council/franchising authority adopts the following:
      1.   At the time of an initial application for an MCS franchise for a
cable system, and contained within any renewal franchise agreement, an MCS
provider classified as a cable operator shall pledge to include the following
guarantees:
         a.   An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provide, at
its own expense, one (1) twelve (12) hour educational channel; and
         b.   An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provide, at
its own expense, one (1) twelve hour (12) governmental channel that is
available for providing coverage of Council meetings, and other related
programming offered or designed by the City Manager, or designated official,
including department heads; and
         c.   An MCS provider classified as a cable operator shall provide, at
its own expense, one (1) twelve (12) hour public access channel that is
available for use by various community groups and organizations.
      2.   At such time as the Council/franchising authority determines the
need for more channel time to exist on any given access channel, an MCS
provider shall make any or all of the access channels available for more than
twelve (12) hours per day upon thirty (30) days written notice.
      3.   Both the Council/franchising authority and the affected cable
operator shall review use after every six (6) months, including the percentage
of use of every PEG channel. At the end of each six (6) month period, the
Council/franchising authority shall evaluate the response and actual use of
such channels. If, after any six (6) month period, the percentage of use for
any required PEG channel drops below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total
time allocated, then the required number of hours shall be reduced to a number
that most closely approximates the average hours of use per day. If the
Council/franchising authority determines the average hours of use per day for
any required PEG channel is less than one (1) hour, then the requirement for
that channel's availability shall cease, and an affected cable operator may use
such channel for any lawful purpose, unless and until the Council/franchising
authority determines that need for the use of the channel again exists.
      4.   If, at any time, ninety percent (90%) of the total time allocated
for any required PEG channel is consistently used five (5) days a week for a
period of three (3) months, then the cable operator shall provide an additional
PEG channel.
      5.   A cable operator shall provide mobile, portable, and stationary
equipment to be used for PEG access, together with the aid of technical and
production assistance provided by the cable operator. A cable operator shall
provide equipment that can store programs for delayed cable-casting. There will
be no cost for technical production assistance for PEG access use to any one
user provided that such use does not exceed fifty (50) actual production man-
hours. Moreover, the cost of maintenance of a PEG access studio, and equipment
required to run the studio shall be borne by the cable operator.
      6.   The City Council/franchising authority may require a cable operator
to provide live cable-casting of City Council meetings and School Board
meetings, as the need may be determined by the respective bodies, and the
operator shall comply with the request to do so within thirty (30) days of
notification by the City Council/franchising authority.
9-118   The Council/Franchising Authority's Policy Regarding Local Production
Facilities And Equipment
   A.   The Council/franchising authority recognizes the fact that certain
needs of the City and the public regarding the transmission and receipt of
information can be met by a local production facility. In order to meet those
above-noted needs, the Council/franchising authority may require, after a
public hearing, that any MCS provider:
      A.   provide and equip, a facility that will enable the City, the public,
and non-profit organizations or agencies to produce and originate video and
audio programming from a fixed studio location.
      B.   equip such facility so as to permit a complete and full array of
production, editing, and program insertion capabilities and functions, as may
be deemed necessary for maximizing the system's capabilities, taking into
account the cost of such requirement.
      C.   activate the system in a bi-directional mode, so as to allow the
live or taped insertion of programming from remote locations throughout the
City for distribution to any and/or all locations within the City, in a time-
frame determined by the City.
      D.   maintain and replace, as needed, any and all, production-related
equipment provided or purchased by the operator in a timely manner, upon
demonstration of the need for such and upon request by the City.
      E.   provide additional production-related equipment, from time-to-time,
as may be deemed necessary for the City to fulfill its goal of maximizing the
capabilities of a system in meeting identified community needs.
9-119   The Council/Franchising Authority's Objective With Respect To The
Provision Of Broad Categories Of Video Programming
   A.   The Council/franchising authority recognizes that under Section 624 of
the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 544), the legal power of local government is
severely restricted in requiring and/or demanding that particular video
programming or other services be provided to subscribers over the multi-channel
system.
   B.   Nevertheless, the Council/franchising authority recognizes that it
should strive to ensure that its citizens receive the widest, and most diverse
selection of video programming possible. Consequently, for those MCS providers
required to maintain a franchise, the Council/franchising authority states as
its objective to such franchised MCS providers, that the provision of services
and video programming categories to subscribers should include at least the
following broad categories:
      1.   local broadcast stations;
      2.   two (2) distant carriage signals, or satellite fed broadcast
stations;
      3.   PEG programming on the lowest offered and/or available tier;
      4.   sports programming services (regional and/or national);
      5.   news, information, or public affairs/interest programming services;
      6.   financial/consumer-oriented programming services;
      7.   scientific and/or cultural programming services;
      8.   children's programming services; and
      9.   ethnically sensitive programming services.
9-120   The Council/Franchising Authority's Policy Regarding The Provision Of
Seamless Or "See-Through" Technology
   A.   The Council/franchising authority recognizes the fact that it is in the
public's interest to be able to utilize the functions inherent in subscriber
receiving equipment, without having to incur additional costs to obtain the
same functions. Consequently, the Council/franchising authority may require
that:
      A.   unless an MCS provider can demonstrate to the City that it is
technically or economically unfeasible or commercially impracticable, then such
MCS provider shall provide the ability to utilize the functions inherent in
subscriber equipment in a seamless or "see-through" manner which allows:
         1.   the use of any built-in remote control capability of a
subscriber's television for the control of any, and all, television channels
provided by the MCS provider without the use or necessity of additional
equipment; and
         2.   the ability to record video programming on any channel provided
by the MCS provider, while watching programming on any different channel,
without the use or necessity of any additional in-home equipment other than the
television receiver/monitor and a recorder.
9-121   Through 9-125 (Reserved)
9-126   Miscellaneous Provisions--Tampering And Unauthorized Reception Of
Certain Services
   A.   Consistent with Section 633 of the CCPA (codified at 47 USC 553), no
person shall intercept or receive, or assist in intercepting or receiving any
communications service offered over a multi-channel system, unless specifically
authorized to do so by an MCS provider, or as may otherwise be specifically
authorized by law.
   B.   For the purpose of this Section, the term "assist in intercepting or
receiving" shall include the manufacture or distribution of equipment intended
by the manufacturer or distributor (as the case may be) for the unauthorized
reception of multi-channel service as noted in subsection (A) of this Section.
   C.   Without securing permission from an MCS provider, or making payment to
an MCS provider, then no person shall be authorized to make any connection,
whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with
any part of an authorized or franchised multi-channel system for the purpose of
receiving or intercepting, or assisting others to receive or intercept any
cable service provided lawfully by the MCS provider.
   D.   No person shall be authorized to willfully tamper with, remove, or
damage any cable, wires, equipment, or facilities used for the distribution of
multi-channel services.
   E.   Any, and all, MCS providers are encouraged to work with the Council/
franchising authority in developing and implementing a plan designed to control
and eliminate the unauthorized reception of certain cable services within the
City.

there has been no such abandonment, then a presumption of abandonment shall no
longer exist. In case abandonment has been complete as hereinbefore provided,
the city may sell and convey title to any such abandoned lot, part of a lot,

13-95   Assessment Method
The method of assessment to be imposed within said district shall be as
follows:
The costs and expenses for the activities proposed to be performed within this
business improvement district will be funded through special assessments, as
authorized by the Business Improvement District Act, against the property in
the district based upon the special benefits to the property, and shall be
fairly and equitably equalized by the City Council sitting as a board of
equalization. The special assessments on each property will be levied annually
based upon the assessed value of individual property divided by total assessed
value of all taxable property in the district times total special assessment
equals individual special assessment. Based upon the recommendation of the
Business Improvement District Board, owner-occupied residential properties
within the district will be assessed at 70% of assessed valuation based on
their primary benefit from the downtown beautification and maintenance
programs. Owners of property exempt from ad valorem taxes are encouraged to
support District activities, promotions, and improvements but property exempt
from ad valorem taxes will not be subject to special assessment for this
Business Improvement District. Property owned by the Federal Government, the
State of Nebraska and political subdivisions thereof shall not be subject to
special assessment for this Business Improvement District. For mixed-use
properties that combine owner-occupied residential and other uses, the property
owner may submit evidence supporting a pro-rated split of the assessed value
(between owner-occupied residential and other uses) for the City Council to
consider when sitting as a board of equalization. The assessed values to be
used in the above formula shall be the values, as shown in the office of the
Hall County Assessor, in effect on the first day of January of the current
year. The city council, sitting as a Board of Equalization, shall levy the
special assessments on all properties at one time, in accordance with the
method of assessment provided above. If the city council finds that the
proposed method of assessment does not provide a fair and equitable method of
apportioning costs, then it may assess the cost under such method as the city
council finds to be fair and equitable. Said assessments shall be payable in
one installment to become delinquent fifty (50) days after the date of such
levy. Delinquent payments shall draw interest at the rate specified in the Neb.
Rev. Stat. §45-104.01, as amended. All special assessments together with
interest and penalties shall be liens upon the property assessed until paid.

Any Distributed Energy Resource (DER) device generating or storing electricity
to be used for domestic purposes that is interconnected with the electrical
supply of the household, business, or industry shall be finished by the Grand
Island Utilities Department in accordance with plans, specifications, rules and
regulations approved by the Utilities Director or his designated representative
and subject to the inspection of the Grand Island Utilities Department prior to
the connected device being energized and put into operation. The standards for
connecting any DER to any property that will be also connected to Grand Island
Electric Utility shall be found in the Grand Island Utilities Department
Metering and Interconnection standards online.
A customer that has a generation facility (or facilities) interconnected behind
their service meter with an aggregate nameplate of 25 kW or less may be
considered as a Qualified Facility (QF) and eligible for participation in a net
metering program. Examples of this include Solar, Diesel Generator, Battery
Bank, Wind Turbine, etc., or any device that may produce electricity. The
program will be available for QF customers until the aggregate nameplate
capacity of the participating QF customers meets one percent (1%) of the peak
annual demand of the Utilities Department. The installation of equipment by the
QF customer must meet all applicable safety, interconnection, and reliability
standards established by the National Electrical Code filed with the Secretary
of State and adopted by the State Electrical Board under subdivision (5) of
section 81-2104, the National Electrical Safety Code, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the Underwriters Laboratories; and

the event of an electrical power outage or other conditions where the line is
de-energized. An outside-mounted visible device shall be installed on the
customer's side of the point of delivery/receipt that must be capable of
preventing energizing the Utilities Department's service line and provide for a
means for the Department to operate and lock in place. The Utilities Department
will provide a bi-directional meter for measurement of the flow of electricity
in both directions. A separate meter socket shall be provided and installed by
the customer between the QF and the point of interconnection with the
customer's electrical panel. The Utilities Department will provide a private
use meter that will be used for measuring gross generation of the QF. Net
excess energy produced by the QF during the billing period will be applied as a
credit to the customer's account at the current month cost of energy per
kilowatt-hour as defined in Division 6. At the end of the calendar year, or
within sixty days after the customer terminates retail service, any excess
credits will be paid to the customer.

15-52   Rate Assignment
The Grand Island Utilities Department will attempt to assign customers to the
lowest applicable rate. It is the customer's responsibility to inform the
Utilities Department of any changes that may affect the assignment or billing
conditions within a given rate.
The customer is in a better position than the Utilities Department to analyze
electric usage. When more than one rate assignment is applicable, the customer
may select the rate considered the most beneficial. Customer-requested rate re-
assignments will not be made more frequently than once every twelve months. In
no event will the Utilities Department be responsible for losses incurred due
to improper rate assignment.
At customer request, demand metering will be installed by the Utilities
Department. The Utilities Department may, at its option, assess a one-time
charge of $200.00 to pay the additional metering facilities.
15-53   Power Factor
All Demand customers shall install power-factor correction equipment, if
necessary, to ensure a power factor of no less than 90%, lagging or leading.
Failure to maintain a power factor of 90% or greater (leading or lagging) will
result in a penalty as stated herein. The Grand Island Utilities Department
will notify any customers who have a power factor of less than 90% for two
consecutive months. Power factor correction penalties will not be applied for
the first 6 months after notification of failure to comply with this provision.
After the initial 6-month period following notification, customer will be
subject to penalties without further notice. For a customer whose power factor
at the time of their Peak Monthly Demand is less than 90%, the Billing Demand
will be multiplied by 90% and divided by the customer's power factor (expressed
in percent) determined at the time of the customer's Monthly Demand.

kilowatt-hour. When the City's cost of energy per kilowatt-hour shall
temporarily be greater than 35.00 mills per kilowatt-hour, there shall be added
to the consumer's monthly charge for electricity used an amount equal to the
number of kilowatt-hours used during the month to which the consumer's charge
applies, multiplied by the amount by which the cost of energy for kilowatt-hour
shall be greater than 35.00 mills per kilowatt-hour.
Cost of energy per kilowatt-hour as determined for any month shall be
applicable to all charges rendered to consumers after the last day of the
following month, without any City Council action.
The cost of energy per kilowatt-hour applied to the consumer's monthly charge
shall be an average of the previous 12-months cost of energy per kilowatt-hour,
provided that between October 2024 and March 2025 the calculation will
transition from 6-months average to 12-months average as follows:
October 2024:      Average of February 2024- August 2024 (7 months)
November 2024:      Average of February 2024- September 2024 (8 months)
December 2024:      Average of February 2024- October 2024 (9 months)

For purposes of this section, the following words shall have the following
meanings:
   Cost of Energy shall mean the power cost for the generating plants owned by
the City, consisting of the monthly natural gas cost and the cost of any fuel
oil consumed; the cost of coal and air quality reagents consumed, including
freight and handling charges; plus costs of payments by the City for power,
energy, and transmission purchased from other power suppliers, less receipts
from energy sold to other electric utilities.
   Cost of Energy per Kilowatt-Hour shall mean "Cost of Energy" as above
defined, divided by 95% of the total kilowatt-hours; consisting of the
kilowatt-hour output of the City's electric generating plants, plus the
kilowatt-hours purchased from other power suppliers, less the kilowatt hours of
energy sold to other electric utilities.

Definition of Standby Capacity: Standby Capacity is defined as the lower of:
   A.   Customer's accredited summer capability, as determined under the
procedures established by Attachment AA of the Southwest Power Pool Open Access
Transmission Tariff, or
   B.   The customer's gross demand, defined as the highest 30-minute
integrated demand of customer facility as determined by a meter that measures
total load, including amounts that may be served by customer-owned generation,
or
   C.   The Contract Standby Capacity, as stated in the service contract
between the Customer and City.
Standby Capacity will be set for a 12-month period beginning on January 1 of
each calendar year based on the above criteria applied to the prior October 1
through September 30.
Determination of Monthly Standby Usage Demand: Monthly Usage Demand equals the
Customer's measured net demand (gross usage less output of customer-owned
generation used to serve customer energy requirements) in a given month, less
the capacity associated with any generation that is out of service for a
maintenance outage that has been approved by the City (see "Maintenance
Outages" section of this rate schedule), up to the Contract Standby Capacity.
Determination of Excess Usage Demand: Excess Usage Demand equals the Customer's
measured gross demand (metered usage including output of customer-owned
generation used to serve customer energy requirements) in a given month, less
the Standby Capacity.
Determination of Hourly Usage Energy: Hourly Usage Energy equals the energy
usage by customer in excess of the output of customer-owned generation,
provided that the energy usage in any hour cannot be less than zero. In the
event that customer-owned generation produces excess energy in a given hour,
the Monthly Usage Energy for that interval shall be zero and any excess energy
shall be reimbursed under the "Excess Energy Rate" section of this rate
schedule.
Determination of Distribution Standby Demand: The Distribution Standby Demand
rate is paid on the Standby Capacity as defined herein.
Determination of Firm Energy: Firm Energy is determined hourly and is equal to
Hourly Usage Energy minus Standby Contract Capacity, provided that the Firm
Energy in any hour cannot be less than zero.
Determination of Standby Energy: Standby Energy is determined hourly and is
equal to the Hourly Usage Energy up to the Standby Capacity.
Deposit: Two (2) times the highest estimated monthly bill. Deposits held until
Customer no longer takes service from the District.
Excess Energy Rate: In the event the customer's generators produce excess
energy over the energy used by the customer's facility and the customer has not
made arrangements with a third party to purchase said energy, the energy shall
be purchased by the City at the real-time locational marginal price for the
Grand Island load settlement location in the Southwest Power Pool Integrated
Marketplace.
Billing for Actual Demand: If customer takes service associated with the
standby capacity from City without approval of a maintenance outage, the
customer will be billed for its Actual Demand based on Schedule 100, provided
that charges for Distribution Standby Service will be credited against the
demand charges applicable to said customer.
Billing for Firm Energy: Firm Energy is billed at the established rate in this
rate schedule, including applicable monthly Power Cost Adjustment.
Billing for Standby Energy: Standby Energy will be assessed based on the number
of kilowatt-hours consumed in any given hour multiplied by the cost of
purchased energy from the Southwest Power Pool. The cost of purchased energy
will be the higher of the day-ahead or real-time locational marginal price for
the Grand Island load settlement location plus 0.0015 per kWh ($1.50 per MWh).
In no instance shall any one (1) hour interval be assessed at less than $0.0015
per kWh ($1.50 per MWh), which will be the minimum assessed hourly rate
calculated.
Maintenance Outages: Customer may take up to 14 days per year of maintenance
outages without being billed for Actual Demand under the following conditions:
   1.   Outages must be scheduled at least 120 days in advance during the
period of September 15 and December 1 and March 15 through May 31, with written
notification provided to the City and approval or rejection provided in writing
to the customer within 7 days, or
   2.   During other periods as agreed-upon by the City based on weather
conditions, loads, and local and regional generation availability, provided the
customer must notify the City at least 14 days prior to any planned outage,
with the City providing an approval or rejection within 7 days of the request.
Minimum Bill: The minimum bill shall be the sum of the following:
   1.   Customer Charge plus
   2.   Distribution Standby Rate multiplied by the contracted standby
capacity, plus
   3.   Generation Standby Rate multiplied by the contracted standby capacity,
plus
   4.   Electric City Dividend.
Specific Terms and Conditions Applicable to Standby Rate: The following terms
and conditions are specific to service provided under this rate schedule:
   A.   Contract Year: All contracts under this schedule shall be for a minimum
period of one year, beginning January 1 and ending December 31, and one-year
periods thereafter until terminated, where service is no longer required on 30
days' notice. Greater minimum periods may be required by contract in situations
involving large or unusual loads.
   B.   Meter Installation: The City shall, at the expense of the customer,
install, own, operate, and maintain the metering to measure the electric power
and energy supplied to customer to allow for proper billing. Said meter will
provide data based on the billing intervals used by the Southwest Power Pool
Integrated Marketplace. In addition, the City will install, at the expense of
the customer, a meter that measures the flow of power and energy from the
customer's own generating facility (generation metering).
      As a result of the electrical or physical configuration of the customer's
generation facility, the City may determine that it is more practical or
economical to use generation metering installed and owned by the customer
rather than installing its own metering equipment. If the City, at its sole
discretion, makes such a determination, then the customer-owned generation
metering may be used for billing purposes, so long as such metering equipment
meets the City's standards for quality and accuracy.

Plus the applicable Power Cost Adjustment charge (applied to energy consumption
only), Power Factor Correction Charge, and Electric City Dividend.
Energy Charge: An Energy Charge will be assessed based on the number of
kilowatt-hours consumed in any given hour multiplied by the cost of purchased
energy from the Southwest Power Pool. The cost of purchased energy will be the
higher of the day-ahead or real-time locational marginal price for the Grand
Island load settlement location plus 0.0015 per kWh ($1.50 per MWh), unless
City and customer agree to a price-sensitive day-ahead energy bid in which
case, the energy charge for the price sensitive load will be based on the Day-
Ahead locational marginal energy price at the Grand Island settlement location
plus 0.0015 per kWh ($1.50 per MWh). In the event that energy is awarded via a
price-sensitive load bid, but not utilized by the customer during the allotted
usage window, the customer will be charged the difference between the Day-Ahead
and Real-Time locational marginal energy prices, plus 0.0015 per kWh ($1.50 per
MWh), for all unused energy.
In no instance shall any one (1) hour interval be assessed at less than $0.0015
per kWh ($1.50 per MWh), which will be the minimum assessed hourly rate
calculated.
Deposit: Two (2) times the highest estimated monthly bill. Deposits held until
Customer no longer takes service from the District.
Facility Charge: City may require a contribution in aid of construction based
on actual cost of improvements necessary to provide interconnection to City's
13.8 kV or 115 kV system.
Minimum Charge: Customer Charge plus Interruptible Demand Charge multiplied by
Contract Interruptible Demand plus Electric City Dividend.
Contract Interruptible Demand: To be eligible for the Interruptible Demand
rate, the customer must demonstrate the ability to interrupt 100% of its Total
Contract Demand with 30 minutes notice and execute a contract specifying the
Contract Interruptible Demand. The City may interrupt service under any of the
following conditions:
   A.   It is anticipated the City's demand in a given hour will be greater
than the forecasted seasonal peak unless customer's service is interrupted.
Winter and Summer Seasons peaks will be analyzed independently of each other.
   B.   The Southwest Power Pool declares an Energy Emergency Alert of any
level.
   C.   The City experiences a facility outage or local system emergency
affecting a facility that is directly necessary to serve the customer.
   D.   Up to an additional 60 hours per Contract Year, the City may interrupt
service at its discretion for economic or operational reasons.
   E.   At the request of the customer, City and customer will coordinate to
provide for a price- sensitive load bid to be submitted in the Day-Ahead
market. A price-sensitive bid is one where the customer provides an upper limit
on the hourly energy rate it is willing to pay. If the price threshold is
exceeded, the customer agrees to interrupt service.
Customer must execute a service agreement specifying the amount of
Interruptible Demand the customer will commit. The service agreement will
include the amount of Interruptible Demand, methodology for measuring
interruptible demand, testing protocols, notification provisions, and other
information necessary to administer the interruption provisions of this rate
schedule. Any non-interruptible load will be connected to a separate meter and
billed based on the otherwise-applicable rate schedule.
To qualify for Interruptible Demand rate, the customer must demonstrate its
ability to interrupt service through an annual test using protocols established
in the service agreement. The test will be performed at a randomly selected on-
peak time and will last up to four hours.
If customer fails to interrupt at any time requested by the City, the customer
will be obligated to pay the Failure to Interrupt Charge for the current month
and the number of prior billing months customer was served by City or eleven
months, whichever is lower. Further, customer will be ineligible for the
Interruptible Demand rate for a period of 5 years and will have their service
converted to the otherwise applicable rate schedule.

15-79   City Dividend for Utility Ownership
All electric services provided by the Grand Island Utilities Department will be
subject to a City Dividend for Utility Ownership. The City Dividend for Utility
Ownership will be set by resolution in the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule
and calculated as a percentage of the total bill. The City Dividend for Utility
Ownership will be identified as a separate line item on an electric bill and
will be calculated as follows:
   Electric City Dividend = Electric Bill Before Sales Tax * Electric City
Dividend Rate
   The City Dividend for Utility Ownership will be subject to applicable sales
tax.
(Ordinance No. 9978, effective 10-01-2024)
(Amended by Ord. No. 9978 (Amended), effective 10-01-2024)
15-80   Contribution in Aid of Construction
The Grand Island Utilities Department, pursuant to this section, will make all
improvements and extensions to its distribution system, which shall include
street lighting units and circuits. The purpose of this Section is to establish
general conditions under which the Grand Island Utilities Department will make
extensions or additions to electric facilities, or upgrades to existing
electric facilities, and the general guidelines to be followed in determining a
customer's Contribution in Aid of Construction (CIAOC).
The Grand Island Utilities Department will make permanent extensions of
electrical lines and facilities and require a customer's CIAOC based on the
customer's estimated new or increased electrical usage associated with the
extension. The Grand Island Utilities Department reserves the right to
determine the advisability and legality of making any extension. Extensions
made by the Grand Island Utilities Department shall remain the property of the
Grand Island Utilities Department.
The Total Extension Investment shall mean the total estimated project cost to
serve a proposed load. This Total Extension Investment shall include, but not
limited to, costs related to materials, labor, vehicles, subsistence, and
applicable overheads, but exclude customer-provided facilities and costs and
any costs incurred but not required solely for the customer's service
requirement.
The Grand Island Utilities Department's required Allowable Investment Limit
(AIL) and the CIAOC calculations within this Section are based on the
customer's projected revenue. To mitigate the Grand Island Utilities
Department's risk for new loads not meeting projected thresholds in a given
time period, the Grand Island Utilities Department reserves the right, in its
sole discretion, to require the customer to enter into an agreement to
guarantee the recovery of line extension costs prior to construction.
Contribution in Aid of Construction Calculation
   1.   The contribution in aid of construction calculations in this section
apply to:
      a.   All three-phase commercial customers, regardless of location, on or
after the effective date of this ordinance.
   2.   All Class 50 and Class 100 three-phase commercial customers will be
provided an AIL equal to 2.5 times the projected annual gross revenue for the
customer, excluding City dividend and sales taxes. In the case of an apartment
or other multi-family unit where individual units are not separated by a
firewall, the dwelling will be considered commercial and revenues will be
calculated based on the projected combined revenue from all services in the
complex. The customer will be required to pay to the City an amount equal to
the actual Total Extension Investment less 2.5 times the projected annual
revenues for the customer. The City will provide an estimate of the amount the
customer is required to pay and the customer will be required to pay that
amount in advance of construction commencement. The City will charge the
customer for any overage in costs and refund any overpayment within 60 days of
the completion of construction. The revenue estimate shall be based on a)
customer's usage at similar facilitates in other jurisdictions, b) similar
existing customers usage, or c) if no other comparison is available, the City
shall assume a load factor and usage based on the transformer size and
historical references.

When the estimated cost of supplies, equipment or contractual services exceeds

after due notice inviting bids or proposals.

official newspaper in the city and at least ten days preceding the last day set
for the receipt of bids or proposals. The bid notice shall include a general
description of the items to be purchased, and shall state where bid forms and

When deemed necessary by the Purchasing Agent, or his/her designee, bid or

identified as bids on the envelope. Bids or proposals shall be opened in public
on the date and at the time and place stated in the public notices. A
tabulation of all bids received shall be available for public inspection.
Proposals shall be evaluated in the manner prescribed in the solicitation but
no tabulation shall be required to be prepared or made available for public
inspection.
When possible, objective evaluation factors should be used in evaluating
solicitations by proposal. Proposals shall include a scoring sheet to be
evaluated by no less than three evaluators. At least one evaluator shall be the
Purchasing Agent. No evaluator shall participate who has been directly
solicited by any company offering a proposal, who has a conflict of interest,
or who has received ex-parte communication from any proposer about the subject
of the procurement within 60 days prior to the solicitation or at any time
during the solicitation.
The City Council shall have the authority to reject all bids or proposals,
parts of all bids or proposals, or all bids or proposals for any one or more
supplies or contractual services included in the proposed contract, when the
public interest will be served thereby.
The City Council shall have the authority to not accept the bid or proposal of
a contractor who is in default on the payment of city collected taxes,
licenses, or other monies due the City.
Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder, or
the proposal which best represents the lowest responsible and responsive

commonly accepted tests and standards of product usability and user
requirements;

of appliances or equipment;

Purchasing Agent, or his/her designee, concerning life-cycle costs between
alternatives for all classes of equipment, evidence of expected life, repair
and maintenance costs, and energy consumption on a per-year basis; and
   J.   Such other information as may be secured having a bearing on the
decision to award the contract.
   K.   A "responsive bidder" shall be defined as a person or company who has
submitted a bid that conforms in all material respects to the "invitation for
bids".
When the award is not given to the lowest bidder, a full and complete statement
of the reasons for placing the order elsewhere shall be prepared by the
Purchasing Agent, or his/her designee, and filed with other papers relating to
the transaction.
No contract in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) for enlargements
or general improvements, such as (by way of illustration, not limitation)
water/sewer main extensions, street improvements, park improvements, or airport
improvements, shall be awarded by the City Council until the plans/
specifications and estimate of the cost are approved by the City Council.
Except in the case of tie bids, there shall be neither formal nor tacit local
vendor's preference policies. The City shall neither impose nor condone any
bidding or procurement policies that result in exclusionary or anti-competitive
bidding or violate state or federal antitrust laws, or which violate the City’s
conflict of interest policy. If all bids received are for the same total amount
or unit price, quality and service being equal, the contract shall be awarded
to a local bidder. Where there is no local bidder or when two or more local
bidders are equal, the Purchasing Agent, or his/her designee, shall award the
contract to one of the tie bidders by drawing lots in public.
The City, whenever applicable, may, by the use of purchasing under a State of
Nebraska contract, purchase supplies, equipment or services without the
necessity of using the formal bid requirements as set forth in this section.
The Purchasing Agent, or his/her designee, shall have the authority to join
with other units of government in cooperative purchasing of supplies, equipment
or services when the best interests of the City would be served thereby. The
Purchasing Agent shall be empowered to authorize purchasing from these
cooperative partnerships in the same manner as they may make purchases under a
State of Nebraska contract.
Decision of the Purchasing Agent. All claims by a contractor against the City
relating to a contract, except bid protests, shall be submitted in writing to
the purchasing agent for a decision. The contractor may request a conference
with the purchasing agent on the claim. Claims include, without limitation,
disputes arising under a contract, and those based upon breach of contract,
mistake, misrepresentation, or other cause for contract modification or
rescission.
Notice to the Contractor of the Purchasing Agent's Decision. The decision of
the purchasing agent shall be promptly issued in writing, and shall be
immediately mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested or otherwise
furnished to the contractor. The decision shall state the reasons for the
decision reached.
Finality of Purchasing Agent's Decision. The purchasing agent's decision shall
be final and conclusive unless the contractor files a timely claim under Neb.
R.R.S. 16-726.
Failure to Render Timely Decision. If the purchasing agent does not issue a
written decision regarding any contract controversy within ten days after
written request for a final decision, or within such longer period as may be
agreed upon between the parties, then the aggrieved party may proceed as if an
adverse decision had been received.
The Purchasing Agent shall have the authority to settle any protest regarding
the solicitation or award of a City contract, or any claim arising out of the
performance of a City Contract, prior to an appeal to the City Council or the
commencement of an action in a court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event all bids exceed the estimated amount by 5%, the Purchasing Agent
and City Attorney may attempt to negotiate a contract with the lowest
responsible bidder for an amount which does not exceed the estimated amount by
5%. In the event the lowest responsible bidder declines to reduce their bid to
amount not to exceed 5% over the estimated cost, the bid shall be canceled, re-
estimated, new solicitations must be obtained.
(Amended by Ordinance No. 10,014, effective 06-7-2025)
27-9   (Reserved)
27-10   Designated Professional Services
For the purpose of procuring professional services, to the extent possible the
processes for obtaining formal contract shall be followed except that
professional services of an attorney, physicians, dentists, accountants, or
veterinarians may be obtained without formal procurement; except that retention
of lawyers may only be done by the City Attorney.
The Purchasing Agent may utilize a system of pre-qualification when deemed
necessary prior to soliciting requests for proposals for professional services.
This request for qualifications shall detail the anticipated professional
service needs and the minimum acceptable qualifications. If at least three
respondents meet these pre-qualification criteria, a solicitation may be
limited only to those pre-qualified respondents.
Professional services must be solicited by a request for proposals published in
the same manner as all formal contracts.
The Purchasing Agent, in conjunction with the head of a using department
requesting such professional services, shall develop all solicitation materials
and shall evaluate all submitted proposals. Discussions held between the
Purchasing Agent and the using Department shall be conducted in a way to avoid
disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by other
offerors.
The Purchasing Agent may develop procedures for the use of a team to evaluate
proposals as they see fit
Professional services worth less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) may be
considered small purchases if they can be made with purchase order and without
contract.
(Amended by Ordinance No. 10,014, effective 06-7-2025)
27-11   Informal Purchasing; Quotations; Small Purchases
When the estimated cost of supplies, equipment or contractual services is less
than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), but more than ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) the purchase shall be made in the open market, without
advertisement and without observing the procedure prescribed for the award of
formal contracts in this article and shall be referred to as quotation based
purchase. All such purchases shall be awarded by the Purchasing Agent, or his/
her designee.
All quotation based purchases greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00)
and not more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) shall be acquired after

be made from the lowest responsible and responsive bidder, in accordance with
the same criteria established for formal contracts.
Before authorizing purchasing by quotation be done by anyone other than the
Purchasing Agent or designee, the Purchasing Agent shall independently verify
the quotations represent a competitive solicitation in the open market. If the
Purchasing Agent becomes aware that any designee or authorized employee is
engaged in anticompetitive solicitation of quotations, the Purchasing Agent
shall deny the authorized individual the authority to purchase by quotation for
a period of no less than 24 months.
If the purchase by quotation can be done via use of a purchasing card or
purchase order, it may be delegated by the Purchasing Agent to individuals or
departments.
Purchases less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) may be made without
formal contract or quotation so long as they are made in good faith on the open
market. These purchases shall be known as small purchases.
If the small purchase can be done via use of a purchasing card or purchase
order, it may be delegated by the purchasing agent to individuals or
departments.
General. The Purchasing Agent shall adopt operational procedures for making
small purchases of materials, supplies, equipment, services or labor in the
amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or less. Such operational
procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for
the supply, service, or construction being purchased. Purchases shall not be
artificially divided so as to constitute a purchase by quotation or general
purchase under this section.

improvement of the electric system or for the purchase of equipment used for
such enlargement or improvement, the amount for three quotes shall be between
ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and one hundred and twenty thousand dollars

clearly and justifiably the only practicable source to provide the service or
personal property. Determination that the contractor selected is justifiably

property or sole availability at the location required.
Items or services necessary to preserve, repair, maintain, extend, or expand,
the useful life and value of any asset that was purchased through an open and
competitive process may be considered for sole or limited source procurement if
due diligence shows that the proposed contractor is the sole and exclusive
provider of the service or items needed to preserve or extend the useful life
and value of any asset so long as the combined value of the necessary item(s)
or service(s) do not exceed the original purchase price of the asset or value
of the original contract or 50% of its remaining useful life prior to the
additional procurement as determined by the Purchasing Agent. This cannot be
used to expand agreements which include architect, engineering, or construction
services; or be used in violation of any other applicable state or federal law.
Sole source designation shall only be valid for ten years and must be
designated so by City Council upon recommendation of the Purchasing Agent.
After ten years, the Purchasing Agent shall resolicit bids for said item(s).
Limited source designation shall only be valid for three years and must be

27-13   Emergency Procurements

authorized by State Statutes make or authorize the Purchasing Agent or others

windstorms, floods, snow, war, or an exigency or pressing necessity or
unforeseen need calling for immediate action or remedy to prevent a serious
loss of, or serious injury or damage to life, health, welfare, safety,
endangering property, or cause disruption of public utility services; provided,

best interests of the City at the sole discretion of the Purchasing Agent or,
when applicable, the City Attorney. The reasons therefor shall be made part of

27-18   Bid And Performance Bonds; Bid Security
Bid security shall be required for all competitive sealed proposals when the
price is estimated by the Purchasing Agent or City Engineer to exceed one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), or for all contracts for public works
improvements in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) as set forth
below, and for any other contracts as deemed necessary by the Purchasing Agent
or using department.
Bid, payment, and performance bonds or other security may be requested for
supply, service or construction contracts as the Purchasing Agent or head of a
using department deems advisable to protect the City's interests, or required
by law. The head of a using department may object to the waiver or exclusion of
security requirements and, upon said objection, Council may require the
Purchasing Agent include any requested security in the solicitation. Any such
bonding requirements shall be set forth in the solicitation. Bid, payment, or
performance bonds shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a
bidder or offeror's responsibility.
Bid security shall be a bond provided by a surety company authorized to do
business in the State of Nebraska, or the equivalent in cash, or otherwise
supplied in a form satisfactory to the City. Nothing herein shall prevent the
requirement of such bonds on construction contracts under one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00) when the circumstances warrant.
Bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least 5% of the amount of the
bid.
When the invitation for bids requires security, noncompliance by a bidder
requires that the bid be rejected unless it is determined that the bid fails to
comply only in a nonsubstantial manner with the security requirements.
If a bidder is permitted to withdraw its bid before award as provided in City
Code, no action shall be had against the bidder or the bid security.
When a contract is awarded in excess of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00)
for the erecting, furnishing, or repairing of any public building, bridge,
roadway, or other public structure or improvement, the following bonds or
security shall be delivered to the City and shall become binding on the parties
upon the execution of the contract:
   A.   A performance bond satisfactory to the City, executed by a surety
company authorized to do business in the State of Nebraska or otherwise secured
in a manner satisfactory to the City, in an amount equal to 100% of the price
specified in the contract; and/or;
   B.   A payment bond satisfactory to the City, executed by a surety company
authorized to do business in the State of Nebraska or otherwise secured in a
manner satisfactory to the City, for the protection of all persons supplying
labor and material to the contractor or its subcontractors for the performance
of the work provided for in the contract. The bond shall be in an amount equal
to 100% of the price specified in the contract.
After ten days written notice to the Mayor and City Council, the purchasing
agent is authorized to reduce the amount of performance and payment bonds to
50% of the contract price for each bond when a written determination is made
that it is in the best interests of the City to do so.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the City
to require a performance bond or other security in addition to those bonds, or
in circumstances other than specified in this section.
Unless otherwise authorized by law, any person who has furnished labor or
material to the contractor or subcontractors for the work provided in the
contract, for which a payment bond is furnished under this section, and who has
not been paid in full within 90 days from the date on which that person
performed the last of the labor or supplied the material, shall have the right
to sue on the payment bond for any amount unpaid at the time the suit is
instituted and to prosecute the action for the amount due that person. However,
any person having a contract with a subcontractor of the contractor, but no
express or implied contract with the contractor furnishing the payment bond,
shall have a right of action upon the payment bond upon giving written notice
to the contractor within 90 days from the date on which that person performed
the last of the labor or supplied the material. That person shall state in the
notice the amount claimed and the name of the party to whom the material was
supplied or for whom the labor was performed. The notice shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope
addressed to the contractor at any place the contractor maintains an office or
conducts business.
Unless otherwise authorized by law, every suit instituted upon a payment bond
shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction for the county or
district in which the construction contract was to be performed. Any person may
request and obtain from the City a certified copy of a bond upon payment of the
cost of reproduction of the bond and postage, if any. A certified copy of a
bond shall be prima facie evidence of the contents, execution, and delivery of
the original.
(Amended by Ordinance No. 10,014, effective 06-7-2025)
27-19   Types Of Contracts
General Authority. The Purchasing Agent shall maintain a list of approved types
of contracts within available purchasing materials. All contracts, regardless
of kind, must promote the best interests of the City. No contract type
prohibited by law may be used. Prior to solicitation the Purchasing Agent shall
review the requested procurement to ensure that the proposed type of contract
is permissible for the proposed procurement.
Prohibited Contracts.
   A.   Cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contracts are prohibited.
   B.   Indefinite term contracts are prohibited.
Restricted Contracts.
   A.   Design-build contracts may be used only when expressly authorized by
law. When permitted by law, the Purchasing Agent shall undergo a cost or price
analysis prior to solicitation and no design-build contract may be awarded
which exceeds the estimated price.
   B.   Cost reimbursement contract may be used only when a determination is
made in writing, that such contract is likely to be less costly to the City
than any other type or that it is impracticable to obtain the supply, service,
or construction item required except under such a contract.
   C.   Contracts with foreign companies may only be used with the approval of
the Purchasing Agent and City Attorney and may not be used when prohibited by
law.
   D.   Contracts which involve a conflict-of-interest, or which are awarded
from a solicitation in which one or more responders had a conflict of interest,
may only be used if the solicitation was conducted in such a manner as to
sufficiently avoid, disclose, and protect against, said conflict. No contract
over two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) involving an actual or potential conflict
of interest may be awarded unless it was publicly solicited and the
solicitation occurred in conformity with all applicable conflict of interest
policies, laws, rules, and regulations.
   E.   Multi-term contracts may be used only when a determination has been
made that:
      1.   The specific period of time is deemed to be in the best interests of
the City;
      2.   The term of the contract and conditions of renewal or extension, if
any, are included in the solicitation and funds are available for the first
fiscal period at the time of contracting;
      3.   Sufficient contract terms have been included to ensure that payment
and performance obligations, for succeeding fiscal periods shall be subject to
the availability and appropriation of funds for said purchase;
      4.   That estimated requirements cover the period of the contract and are
reasonably firm and continuing; and
      5.   That such a contract will serve the best interests of the City by
encouraging effective competition or otherwise promoting economics in City
procurement.
      6.   Multi-term contracts must include clarity regarding cancellation due
to unavailability of funds in succeeding fiscal periods. Provisions should
include clear notice that when funds are not appropriated or otherwise made
available to support continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period,
the contract shall be canceled and the contractor shall be reimbursed for the
reasonable value of any non-recurring costs incurred but not amortized in the
price of the supplies or services delivered under the contract. The cost of
cancellation may be paid from any appropriations available for such purposes.
   F.   Multiple Source Contracts. Are an award of an indefinite quantity
contract for one ormore similar supplies or services to more than one bidder or
offeror. The obligation to order the City's actual requirements is limited by
the provision of Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-306(1) and other applicable
laws, rules, and regulations. A multiple source award may be made when award to
two or more bidders or offerors for similar products is necessary for adequate
delivery, service, or product compatibility. Any multiple source award shall be
made in accordance with all other provisions of City Code as applicable.
Multiple source awards shall not be made when a single award will meet the
City's needs without sacrifice of economy or service. Awards shall not be made
for the purpose of dividing the business, making available product or supplier
selection to allow for user preference unrelated to utility or economy, or
avoiding the resolution of tie bids. Any such awards shall be limited to the
least number of suppliers necessary to meet the valid requirements. If a
multiple source award is anticipated prior to issuing a solicitation, the
reservation of a right to issue such award and the criteria shall be included
in the solicitation and the purchasing agent shall note the reason for their
approval of this type of contract in the contract file. When awarded, multiple
source contracts shall include the following provisions:
      1.   All known or anticipated non-City users of the contract shall be
named in the solicitation.
      2.   A notation that additional bids may be separately taken if a
particular quantity requirement arises which exceeds the requirements set forth
in the solicitation or an amount specified in the contract.
      3.   A notation that the City reserves the right to take bids separately
if the purchasing agent approves a finding that the supply or service available
under the contract will not meet a nonrecurring special need of the City.

variations are supported by a written determination that states the
circumstances justifying such variations, and provided, that notice of any such
material variation be stated in the invitation for bids or request for
proposals. In the event standard clauses are used they shall be included in any

(s) at question. Contracts for public works shall include a provision for the
maintenance of fair labor standards as required in Neb. R.R.S. 73-102, other

faith the contract may be declared null and void or voidable, if such action is
in the best interests of the City.

30-74   Monitoring Facilities
30-75   Surcharge For Class Groups
30-76   Contract For Reserved Capacity
30-70   When Surcharge Is Applicable
An industrial waste surcharge shall be assessed against any person discharging
industrial wastes into the City's sanitary sewer system where the contributed
waste strength exceeds that of "Normal Strength Wastewater" as defined in §30-
1. Persons subject to the industrial waste surcharge shall be subject to the
regular sewer user charges.
30-71   Pollutants Subject To Surcharge
The monthly amount of pollutants subject to the surcharge will be based on the
average loading per plant operating day, times the number of operating days in
the month the limits are exceeded. The pollutants limits that shall be subject
to a surcharge are as follows:
 
BOD                                  250 mg/L
Suspended Solids or TSS              250 mg/L
Fats, Oils, and Grease               100 mg/L
Total Nitrogen (Organic & Inorganic) 25 mg/L
Hydrogen Sulfide                     0 mg/L
pH                                   less than 6 S.U.
pH                                   greater than 9 S.U.
 
30-72   Amount Of Surcharge
The industrial waste surcharge to be assessed each month will be determined by
application of the rates then in effect.
The surcharge amount shall be determined by calculating the average number of
pollutant pounds per operating day based on the average of periodic grab or
composite samples obtained and tested as described in §
30-63.
In computing the surcharge amount, no credit will be allowed because a
pollutant strength is less than that allowed in "Normal Strength Wastewater."
30-73   Review Of Surcharge Rates
The director shall review the surcharge rates each August and adjust them, if
necessary, to reflect the actual cost to treat the pollutants subject to the
surcharge.
30-74   Monitoring Facilities
When a person discharges a waste that is subject to the industrial waste
surcharge, the director may require monitoring facilities be provided. The
installation and use of the monitoring facilities shall be in compliance with §
30-60 and §
30-63.
30-75   Surcharge For Class Groups
The director may classify certain commercial and industrial establishments
which routinely discharge BOD and suspended solids concentrations exceeding
those established for "Normal Strength Wastewater," into the following classes:
   A.   Eating Places. Includes restaurants, bars, lounges, and other
establishments which engage in the preparation of food or beverage which is
served directly to the consumer.
   B.   Food and Kindred Products Processing. Includes commercial
establishments which engage in the preparation, packaging, processing, or
distribution of food, food products, grains, or produce, and which discharge
less than 200,000 gallons of wastes per month.
   C.   Equipment Service Facilities. Includes establishments which perform
washing, cleaning, or servicing of automobiles, trucks, buses, machinery, or
equipment; this class to include public facilities, facilities limited to
specific companies, and attended or coin-operated establishments.
The director shall assess an industrial waste surcharge for each class based on
waste strength determinations established by averaging grab or composite
samples or both, taken from a representative number of establishments in each
class and shall apply this surcharge to the water consumption or metered
wastewater of the establishment. If the establishment is within a larger
facility for which water usage is determined from a master meter, the director
shall determine an estimated volume for the establishment on which the
surcharge is applied. The director shall then add the appropriate industrial
surcharge to billings for regular water and sanitary sewer service for each
establishment included in one of the classes.
If an establishment contains operations from more than one of the classes, and
the director determines that the surcharge for a particular class would not
adequately compensate the City for its cost of treatment, the director may
assess a surcharge based on a proportional average of the class surcharges
involved, or may require the establishment to be billed under the requirements
of §
30-70.
The owner of an establishment classified into one of the classes may elect to
have the industrial surcharge billed under §
30-70 rather than this section, by making application to the director and
paying the required sampling costs.
The director may revise the class surcharges in the future to reflect a change
in the average strength of the wastes discharged or to reflect a change in the
costs to treat these wastes.
30-76   Contract For Reserved Capacity
The director may, with the approval of the council, enter into a contract with
persons discharging industrial wastes who desire to reserve a portion of the
design capacity of the sanitary sewer system or water pollution control plant.
The contract shall contain a provision stating that an annual amount,
representing the person's proportionate share of the City's net annual capital
investment cost in the facilities reserved, shall be paid by the person signing
the contract. The contract shall also contain a provision that if the person's
average daily flow varies more than 20 percent on a yearly basis, either party
may open the contract for renegotiation of the minimum payment.

30-77   Purpose Of Article
The mayor and council of the city hereby find and determine: This City has
constructed and owns and operates a sewerage system and plant for the
treatment, purification, and disposal in a sanitary manner of the liquid and
solid wastes, sewage, and night soil of such community and it is necessary, in
order to protect the health of the inhabitants of the city and to comply with
the law of the state and the requirements of the department of health of the
state that the sewerage system be operated and maintained; that in order to
provide the revenues to operate and maintain the sewer system and disposal
plant and to create a reserve fund for the purpose of future maintenance, it is
necessary that the City establish just and equitable rates and charges to be
paid to the City for the use of such disposal plant and sewerage system by each
person whose premises are served thereby.
30-78   Consumer; Defined
The word "consumer" as used in this article shall include all users of the
municipal sewerage system of the City, including all persons whose premises are
served thereby and all owners and tenants of real estate and buildings
connected with such sewerage system or served thereby and all users of such
system who in any way use the same or discharge sanitary sewage, industrial
waste, water or other liquid either directly or indirectly into the sewerage
system of the City.
30-79   Consumer; Classification
Consumers shall be classified as residential or commercial. For the purposes of
this article a residential consumer is one whose property is used exclusively
for residential purposes and commercial consumers are all consumers other than
residential consumers.
30-80   Rental Charge; Computation
For the use of the city sewer system, each consumer shall pay a rental charge
which shall be computed and based on his contribution of sewage to such system;
provided, that a minimum charge for sewer rental as set forth in §
30-84 and §
30-85 shall be made for each dwelling unit which is directly or indirectly
connected to the City sanitary sewer system, unless for a complete billing
period the City water supply to such unit has been disconnected by the City, or
the private water supply disconnected to the satisfaction of the City. For the
purposes of this Article, a dwelling unit shall mean one or more rooms and a
single kitchen designed as a unit for occupancy by one family for living and
sleeping purposes, and shall include a manufactured home. If more than one
dwelling unit is served from a single water meter or single private water
source as in the case of apartments and mobile home courts, a percentage of the
minimum rate shall be charged against each unit, depending on the number of
dwelling units per water meter or private water source as follows:
 
2 to 5 dwelling units      65%
6 to 10 dwelling units     60%
11 to 20 dwelling units    55%
21 and over dwelling units 50%
 
The above charges shall be computed upon the yearly average of the number of
dwelling units occupied.
30-81   Rental; Residential And Commercial
The charges to be paid by residential consumers for use of the sewerage system
and disposal plant shall be based upon water consumption. The monthly
residential sewer charges for the twelve months following April 1st of each
year will be based on the average water consumption for that property during
the months of January, February and March. Commercial customers shall pay
according to the meter reading which precedes billing.
(Amended by Ordinance No. 9524, effective 03/17/2015)
30-82   Rental Charge; Use Of Water Meters
The sewer rental charge shall be applied separately to each individual water
meter which measures water contributing to or discharging into the city
sewerage system and shall be determined by the water meter reading for water
furnished by the water works system of the city or by privately-owned water
supply which may contribute to or discharge into the sewerage system. In the
case of unmetered water supply, the quantity of water used and discharged into
the sewerage system of the City shall be determined to the satisfaction of the
council and at the expense of the owner of the unmetered water supply. If the
quantity of unmetered water discharged into the sewerage system is estimated by
the council to be in excess of one thousand cubic feet per month for any one
month, the council may require that such water supply be metered at the expense
of the owner or consumer.
Should any meter get out of order or repair and fail to register properly, such
consumer will be charged at the average monthly consumption as shown by the
meter when in order for six months previous, or fraction thereof, if the same
has not been used that long.
30-83   Volume Charges
The charges for sewer service shall be paid either quarterly or monthly in
conformance with the billing for water, and each consumer shall be billed per
100 cubic feet in accordance with the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule.

applied to those industrial users who certify that their sewage contributions
are less than normal strength wastewater, and such customers shall be billed in
accordance with the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule.
Customer Charge. The specific costs incurred by the City associated with
monitoring and determining flow and strength and/or checking the users
certification.

service charge, volume charge and/or extra strength surcharge. For customers
billed on the industrial four part charge, the minimum charge shall be the sum
of the volume, BOD, SS, oil and grease, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and customer
charge.

The mayor and council hereby find and determine that the rental charges
established by this article are just and equitable rates and charges to be paid
to the City for the use of its disposal plant and sewerage system by each
person whose premises are served thereby. All moneys collected for such rental
charges shall be paid into the sewer and sewer collection funds and shall be
used only for the purpose of maintenance and operation of the existing sewer
system and disposal plant, and to create a reserve fund for the purpose of
future maintenance, pursuant to Article 5, Chapter 18, Reissue Revised Statutes
of Nebraska 1943.
30-92   Accounting System
Under Ordinance No. 4131, the City of Grand Island, Nebraska, has agreed to
account for its revenues and expenditures in a specified manner. It is

combination of them within the area of any street right-of-way lying within the
limits of the City, or within its zoning jurisdiction, shall notify the public
works director of such intent or desire and obtain a permit therefor. No
construction or reconstruction work in connection therewith shall be started
until the public works director has furnished specifications for such work. A
permit fee in accordance with the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule shall be
charged for each permit, and each permit shall expire six months from date of
issuance. The City Council may, by resolution, waive the permit fee.
(Amended by Ord. No. 8808, eff. 5/7/2003) (Amended by Ord. No. 9205, effective
02/25/09)
32-53   Duties Of Public Works Director
The public works director shall furnish specifications for all approved
projects described by §
32-52, and shall cause the work to be inspected at proper times to see that
such work is done in accordance with such specifications. No additional fee
shall be collected for the inspection service, nor for the original engineering
service.
(Amended by Ord. No. 9205, effective 02/25/09)
32-54   Material; Location; Curb Length
All curbs and gutters, public sidewalks and hard-surfaced driveways constructed
or reconstructed within the area of any street right-of-way shall be of

curb sidewalk between successive streets or between a street and an alley. The
intent of this section is to provide for uniform sidewalk construction between
successive streets or streets and alleys. In some instances, intersections or
alleys are not in existence in newly platted areas, or blocks in earlier
platted areas are excessive in length, in which case curb sidewalk may be
constructed only if it will be continuous for approximately one block and there
remains a continuous distance of the same length for construction of
conventional sidewalk. For the purpose of this section, one block is defined as

property line, the sidewalk must be at least five feet in width and extend to
the property line.
In areas classified as rural routes by the U.S. Postal Service, properties will
be allowed curb sidewalk only if the following conditions exist:

installation of the sidewalk; and
   B.   If all property owners installing curb sidewalk agree to neighborhood
box units which are approved and installed by the U.S. Postal Service; and
   C.   If the section of sidewalk will be consistent between successive
streets or from a street to an alley.
(Amended by Ord. No. 9227, effective 07/29/09)
32-56   Specifications
The public works director shall determine and provide specifications for the
surfaced driveways as nearly uniform as possible throughout the City, and, in
determining such specifications, shall consider the mixture of materials,
forming, thickness, handling, finishing, expansion joints, foundations,
compaction, and any other items or phases for the highest durability of the
completed structure, and for safety, convenience, and general utility. Special
consideration shall be given to design for vehicle crossings and driveways.
32-57   Costs At And Within Intersections
The owners of corner lots at the intersections of streets shall be responsible
for the cost of construction of the extensions of public sidewalks to the
adjacent curb lines, and, in case of curb sidewalk construction, shall be
responsible for the cost of all such sidewalks laid within the street
intersection area.

one percent per month shall be paid thereon as in the case of other special
taxes. The council shall pay for the building of such permanent sidewalk out of
the general fund.
   B.   Sidewalks; Failure to Improve.
      1.   Whenever it shall be determined by a three-fourths vote of the city
council that public sidewalks are not in place contiguous to the street side
boundary lines of any lot, tract, or parcel of land within the city, or that
any sidewalks then in place are of insufficient width for usual and convenient
use by the public, or that any sidewalks are not laid upon property grade and
line, or are of defective construction, or are in a state of disrepair, or are
obstructed so as to make such sidewalks unsafe, dangerous or hazardous for
public use, then the Public Works Department shall send notice to the property
owner giving 15 days to obtain a permit and an additional 15 days to construct
or repair the sidewalk as required. Notice will be sent by regular United
States mail to the owner’s last known address.
      2.   In case the owner or owners of any lot, lots or lands abutting on

all members may, by ordinance, create a sidewalk district pursuant to §19-2417,
R.R.S. Neb., and cause such sidewalk to be constructed, reconstructed, or
repaired as the case may be and shall contract thereof. The council shall levy
assessments on the lots and parcels of land abutting on or adjacent to the
sidewalk improvements especially benefited thereby in such district in
proportion to the benefits, to pay the cost of such improvement. All
assessments shall be a lien on the property on which levied from the date of
the levy until paid. The assessment of the special tax, for the sidewalk
improvement, shall be levied at one time and shall become delinquent as
follows: One-seventh of the total assessment shall become delinquent in ten
days after such levy; one-seventh in one year; one-seventh in two years; one-
seventh in three years; one-seventh in four years; one-seventh in five years;
and one-seventh in six years. Each of such installments, except the first,

sidewalks and free them from obstructions and accumulations of snow, ice, mud,
and slush. The cost of such service shall constitute an assessment and tax upon
the real estate adjacent to the sidewalks involved and shall remain a lien on
the real estate which may be foreclosed by the City in the manner provided by
law for other liens or assessments, with the priority of other taxes.
Any person who is injured by the failure or neglect of the owner and occupant

fence, foliage, or other screening material adjacent to such thoroughfare. The
sight-obscuring fence shall not be metal strips or slats in a chain link fence.
      2.   If the highway is not a non-access or controlled access
thoroughfare, one of the following methods of development shall be required:
         a.   Either method required for a non-access or controlled access
thoroughfare may be applied; or
         b.   Lots may have frontage directly on such thoroughfare, provided,
that the minimum setback for any new building in any zoning district shall be
thirty feet, and shall be landscaped except for approved driveways.
   E.   Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, or where it is found to be practicable to
require the dedication of the other half when adjoining property is subdivided.
   F.   Under normal conditions streets shall be laid out as to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles, except where topography or other conditions
justify variations. More than four approaches to any intersection shall be
prohibited. Street jogs at intersections with centerline offsets of less than
75 feet should be avoided.
   G.   Alleys may be provided in commercial and industrial districts. Alleys
shall be avoided in residential districts except to extend existing alleys to a
street.
   H.   The right-of-way widths, improvements, and grades for streets and
alleys included in any subdivision shall not be less than the minimum right-of-
way and outside curb dimensions or less than the minimum grade for each

(Amended by Ordinance No. 9688, effective 06-12-2018)
33-13   Blocks
   A.   Block Length. Intersecting streets determining block lengths shall be
provided at such intervals as to serve cross traffic adequately and to meet
existing streets and customary subdivision practice in the immediate area.
Blocks shorter than 450 feet and longer than 1200 feet in residential districts
should be avoided.
   B.   Block Width. The width of a block shall be sufficient to allow for two
tiers of lots with utility easement, if required. Blocks intended for business
or industrial use shall be of such width as may be best suited for the
contemplated use of the property taking into consideration the probable
arrangement of parking and truck loading and maneuvering upon the property.
   C.   Very Large Lots and Blocks. When a tract is subdivided into larger than
normal lots or parcels, such lots or parcels should be so arranged as to permit
the logical location and opening of future streets and appropriate
resubdivision with provision for adequate utility connections for such
resubdivision. Easements for the future openings and extension of such streets
may, at the direction of the Planning Commission, be made a requirement of the
plat.
33-14   Lots
   A.   Minimum Dimensions. The minimum width of lots shall be as required by
the Zoning Chapter of the Grand Island City Code. Side lot lines should be at
right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. Lots
having a depth of less than 100 feet should be avoided. Lot sizes shall meet or
exceed the requirement of the Zoning Chapter and should as near as practical
meet or exceed the typical lot size for building sites in the immediate
vicinity. Each lot shall be a buildable site after taking into account all yard
spaces required by the Zoning Chapter. Excessive lot depth in relation to width
should be avoided.
   B.   Corner Lots Wider. Corner lots in residential areas shall be of
sufficient size to comply with the requirements of the Zoning Chapter.
   C.   Double Frontage. Lots with street frontage at both front and rear shall
be avoided except when backing on a controlled access thoroughfare.
   D.   Street Frontage. Each lot shall have frontage (minimum width of twenty
(20) feet) on a street that will allow for practical, physical vehicular
ingress/egress, and allow for the proper provision of present or future
municipal services to the lot.
   E.   Reversed Frontages and Key Lots. Reversed frontages at cross street
intersections should be avoided except where it will match existing
development. Key lots, being those inside lots fronting on side streets, should
be avoided except where they are matching existing development and other lots
are excessively deep. Key lots shall be prohibited where they disrupt utility
or drainage easements. Reverse frontage and normal corner lots when adjacent to
a key lot shall have additional width to allow front yard setbacks on both
streets.
   F.   Septic Tanks. In subdivisions within city jurisdiction outside of
corporate limits where buildings are to be served by septic tanks, the size of
lots shall be sufficiently large to accommodate adequate drainage fields.
Standards set forth by the appropriate County and State or other agencies shall
be met.
   G.   Flag Lots. Flag lots, being those lots landlocked from public right-of-
way except for a narrow tract of land of less width than minimum frontage as
required by the Zoning Chapter should be discouraged except where development
cannot reasonably be accomplished without their use. When such lots are
platted, it shall be a requirement of the developer, builder, and owner to
direct and maintain storm water drainage from the flag lot to the public right-
of-way without directing the flow to adjoining property, i.e., drainage shall
be by means of that strip of land connecting the area of the structure to the
public right-of-way unless other drainage facilities are approved by the public
works director.
(Amended by Ord. No. 8921, effective 7-28-2004)
33-15   Easements
   A.   Utility Easements. Unless otherwise required by the director of
Planning, the director of utilities operations, or the public works director,
utilities easements shall be 20 feet wide, falling half on adjoining lots along
rear lot lines, and where necessary the same shall apply to side lot lines. The
full width of an easement may fall on one lot. They shall be planned for easy
and continuous access for maintenance, shall be continuous through the block
and shall connect as nearly in line as possible with adjoining easements. To
facilitate the use of easements, rear lot lines in curvilinear platting shall
form straight lines for as long a distance as feasible. Direction changes shall
fall so that a side lot line will intersect the point of change so as to allow
the guywire easements to be located on lot lines.
   B.   Drainage Easements. Drainage easements for storm sewers or open
channels shall be required where storm drainage cannot be practically carried
under streets or in the right-of-way. Open channel drainage easements shall be
required where there is evidence that the natural drainage for a large area
traverses the subdivision. Drainage easements shall be sufficient in width so
that motorized equipment may be used in their maintenance.
33-16   Pedestrian Ways
Pedestrian ways may be required so as to allow cross access for pedestrians in
very long blocks. In general, blocks of 800 feet or more in length may have a
requirement for a pedestrian way near the center of the block and shall have a
minimum width of six feet. Pedestrian ways shall have a sidewalk width of four
feet and have a minimum 42 inch high chain link fence on both sides.
33-17   Reserve Strips Of Land
Reserve strips of land controlling access to or egress from their property, or
from any other street or alley, shall not be permitted within any subdivided
area.
33-18   School, Park, Or Open Space Sites
The Planning Commission may require the subdivider to reserve for purchase-
option certain parcels of land for public use. The public agency shall have
from the time of submission of the preliminary study to the submission of the
final plat to exercise the purchase-option under this provision. The exact
location of the reserved area shall be subject to approval of the Planning
Commission.
Article 33-V
Minimum Improvements
33-19   Minimum Improvements
33-20   Installation Of Improvements
33-19   Minimum Improvements
Inasmuch as the primary purpose of subdividing land is to create building
sites, and inasmuch as vehicular access and certain utilities are essential to
urban development, it shall be the responsibility of the developer to install
in accordance with plans, specifications, and data approved by the public works
director, certain required improvements as follows:
   A.   Staking. The following described monuments shall be installed before
the public works director shall approve the plat, or in lieu thereof, a
performance bond in an amount equal to the cost of doing such work shall be
furnished to the City of Grand Island before the public works director shall
certify to the council that the required improvements have been satisfactorily
arranged.
      1.   The external boundaries, corners of blocks and lots, all points of
curvature, and points of tangency, shall be monumented by an iron rod or pipe
not less than 1/2 inch outside diameter and extending at least 24 inches below
grade.
   B.   Grading of Lots. When any building site is filled to a depth in excess
of five feet, said fill shall be laid down in six-inch layers, and each layer
shall be given six passes with a sheepsfoot roller with optimum moisture
present for compaction to equal the bearing strength of the natural ground,
indicated by Proctor test or other test which may be approved by the public
works director.
   C.   Storm Drainage shall be conveyed to an approved storm drainage system
if available and adequate to accept the runoff from the fully developed
subdivision. Available shall mean a system approved by the public works
director to serve the proposed subdivision. If an approved system is available
but not of adequate capacity, then provisions must be made for on-site
detention to reduce the peak flow out of the subdivision to that which the
approved system can accommodate. The detention cell shall be sized to
accommodate a ten-year design storm as per criteria acceptable to the public
works director. In computing cell capacity only the capacity above the
elevation at which approved positive drainage exists will be considered.
Detention cells without approved positive drainage will not be accepted.
Determination of the approved form of positive drainage shall be made by the
public works director. Gravity drainage shall be used if possible. Provisions
shall be made for surface water traversing the subdivision. The subdivision
agreement shall prohibit filling in of ditches or other drainage facilities and
specify ownership and maintenance responsibility of detention cells and other
drainage features not dedicated to the public.
   D.   Sanitary Sewer shall be provided to connect all lots in the subdivision
in accordance with standard specifications of the City of Grand Island to an
approved public system if available and adequate to accept the flow from the
fully developed subdivision. Available shall mean an existing approved system
or a system approved for construction by the City. The city council may extend
consideration of the preliminary study for up to 120 days to consider a
sanitary sewer extension approval. In no case shall the minimum diameter for
residential developments be less than eight inches, and for commercial and
industrial developments the minimum shall be ten inches. If an approved system
is not available, then individual systems may be permissible on an initial
basis, however, the subdividers shall be required to install the complete
system to serve the subdivision even though it may not be connected with the
approved system.
The requirement to install the complete but unconnected system shall not apply
to existing right-of-ways, with existing improvements, when determined by the
Planning Director along with recommendations from the Public Works Department
and the Utility Department that public service mains will not be installed to
serve the subdivision in the near future.
The requirement to install the complete but unconnected system shall not apply
for a subdivision having four (4) lots or less unless the subdivision is part
of a larger development being finalized in phases, except when:
      1.   The construction of the public system which will serve the
subdivision is provided for in the current approved Capital Improvement Program
for the City of Grand Island, or;
      2.   The Council officially amends said program to include a public
system which will serve the subdivision, and;
      3.   The City can provide the subdivider sufficient information for the
design and construction of his system.
In the event that individual systems are to be used, then the Subdivision
Agreement shall state that the lot owners waive the right to protest creation
of a sanitary sewer district abutting the subdivision or to serve the
subdivision, shall keep all easements free of any obstructions, including
fences, trees and bushes, sheds, etc.; shall indemnify the City of any removal/
replacement/repair costs for obstructions in easements for the construction of
such district, and shall connect to such district within two (2) years of the
district construction completion.
   E.   Water Supply shall be provided to connect all lots in the subdivision
in accordance with standard specifications for the City of Grand Island to an
approved public system if available and adequate to serve the needs of the
fully developed subdivision. Available shall mean an existing approved system
or a system approved for construction by the City. The city council may extend
approval of the preliminary study for up to 120 days to consider a water main
extension approval. Fire hydrants shall be installed in a pattern approved by
the director of utility operations and the fire chief. If an approved system is
not available, then individual systems may be permissible on an initial basis,
however, the subdivider shall be required to install the complete system to
serve the subdivision even though it may not be connected with the approved
system.
The requirement to install the complete but unconnected system shall not apply
to existing right-of-ways, with existing improvements, when determined by the
Planning Director along with a recommendation from the Public Works Department
and the Utility Department that public service mains will not be installed to
serve the subdivision in the near future.
The requirement to install the complete but unconnected system shall not apply
for a subdivision having four (4) lots or less unless the subdivision is part
of a larger development being finalized in phases, except when:
      1.   The construction of the public system which will serve the
subdivision is provided for in the current approved Capital Improvement Program
for the City of Grand Island, or;
      2.   The Council officially amends said program to include a public
system which will serve the subdivision, and;
      3.   The City can provide the subdivider sufficient information for the
design and construction of his system.
In the event that individual systems are to be used, then the Subdivision
Agreement shall state that the lot owners waive the right to protest creation
of a water district abutting the subdivision or to serve the subdivision, shall
keep all easements free of any obstructions, including fences, trees and
bushes, sheds, etc.; shall indemnify the City of any removal/replacement/
repair costs for obstructions in easements for the construction of such
district, and shall connect to such district within two (2) years of the
district construction completion.
   F.   Grading shall be completed to official grade on all streets for the
full width of the right-of-way and fills shall be compacted sufficiently to
assure adequate support for permanent paving, as set forth by standard
specifications of the City of Grand Island.
   G.   Street Surfacing. Paving, including curbs and gutters, shall be
completed on all streets in accordance with the standard specifications of the
City of Grand Island and in conformity with any official street plans which may
be adopted by the city council of Grand Island. Standard installations for
sanitary sewer, storm drainage, and water may be required to be installed
before paving, subject to the recommendation of the public works director, even
though such facilities cannot be connected with the City system at the time of
approval of the plat.
   H.   Public sidewalks four feet wide shall be constructed in accordance with
sidewalk standards along each side of all public street right-of-way to serve
all lots in the plat. This requirement may be waived until the Council directs

maximum height limitation of the underlying zoning district. A permit is
required for replacement utility support structures.
   M.   Use of Street Lights. For public safety and welfare considerations, the
City strongly discourages wireless providers from placing small wireless
facilities on any poles (street light, traffic signal or otherwise) located at
an intersection having traffic control signals. Instead, the City encourages
wireless providers to place small wireless facilities on street lights
elsewhere in the right-of-way. The City also encourages wireless providers to
place small wireless facilities on structures or buildings outside of the
right-of-way rather than placing new poles in the right-of-way.
   N.   For public safety and welfare reasons, the City will not allow the
placement of small wireless facilities on electric transmission poles. However,
small wireless facilities may be placed on distribution poles subject to the
other requirements of this Article.
34-78   Access To Right-Of-Way
   A.   General Terms.
      1.   The term of an Agreement shall be for up to ten (10) years unless

wireless communication facilities, including any pole built for the sole or
primary purpose of supporting the wireless communication facilities to provide
the services expressly authorized in the Agreement, subject to applicable laws,
this Article and the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The Agreement
authorizes use only of the right-of-way in which the City has an actual
interest. It is not a warranty of title or interest in any right-of-way, and it
does not confer on the provider any interest in any particular location or to a
superior or preferred location within the right-of-way. All use of City poles
or other structures in the right-of-way shall require payment of fees for such
use.
      3.   The provider shall, at its sole cost and expense, keep and maintain
its wireless communication facilities and poles in the right-of-way in a safe
condition, and in good order and repair.

of-way any wireless communication facility, or any pole built for the sole or
primary purpose of supporting a wireless communication facility, a person shall
enter into a Pole Attachment or other agreement (“Agreement”) with the City
expressly authorizing use of the right-of-way for the wireless communication
facility or pole proposed to be installed. The Agreement shall provide for the
attachment to City-owned poles or structures in the right-of-way in addition to
poles or structures owned by unrelated third parties, provided that the
applicant secures the written consent of the third party for such attachment.
34-79   Preferred Pole Locations
   A.   All poles for supporting small wireless facilities in the right-of-way
are permitted only after applying the following siting priorities, ordered from
most-preferred (1) to least-preferred (6):
      1.   existing street lights;
      2.   relocated street lights;
      3.   replacement of street lights (with a pole of dual functionality) at
the same location that can structurally support the Small Wireless Facilities;
      4.   new poles in the right-of-way specifically for Small Wireless
Facilities;
      5.   electric distribution poles if they can meet the pole attachment
agreement requirements;
      6.   traffic control signals but they must show why none of the other
choices will work and ensure that the provider’s equipment will not interfere
with the functionality of the traffic signals.
   B.   The applicant for a pole shall address preferences 4-6 in an
alternative sites analysis prepared pursuant to §
34-80 below.
34-80   Alternative Sites Analysis
   A.   For a pole other than 1-3 in §
34-79, the applicant must address the City’s preferred locations with a
detailed explanation justifying why a site of higher priority was not selected.
The City’s location preferences must be addressed in a clear and complete
written alternative sites analysis that shows at least three (3) higher ranked,
alternative sites considered that are in the geographic range of the service
coverage or capacity objectives of the applicant, together with a factually
detailed and meaningful comparative analysis between each alternative candidate
and the proposed site that explains the substantive reasons why the applicant
rejected the alternative candidate.
   B.   A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this subsection
may include less than three (3) alternative sites so long as the applicant
provides a factually detailed written rationale for why it could not identify
at least three (3) potentially available, higher ranked, alternative sites.
   C.   For purposes of disqualifying potential collocations or alternative
sites for the failure to meet the applicant’s service coverage or capacity
objectives the applicant will provide (a) a description of its objective,
whether it be to address a deficiency in coverage or capacity; (b) detailed
maps or other exhibits with clear and concise Radio Frequency (“RF”) data to
illustrate that the objective is not met using the alternative (whether it be
collocation or a more preferred location); and (c) a description of why the
alternative (collocation or a more preferred location) does not meet the
objective.
34-81   Antenna Arrays
Antenna arrays are permitted in any zoning district as long as they are located
upon an existing structure, excluding single family and duplex properties, that
provides sufficient elevation for the array’s operation without the necessity
of constructing a tower or other apparatus to extend the antenna array more
than ten feet (10’) above the structure. Installation on City property requires
the execution of necessary agreements.
34-82   Accessory Uses, Equipment, Design, And Standards
   A.   Accessory Uses.
      1.   Accessory uses shall be limited to such structures and equipment
that are necessary for transmission or reception functions, and shall not
include broadcast studios, offices, vehicles or equipment storage, or other
uses not essential to the transmission or reception functions.
      2.   All accessory buildings shall be constructed of building materials
equal to or better than those of the primary building on the site and shall be
subject to applicable permits.
   B.   Accessory Equipment. All accessory equipment located at the base of a
WCF shall be located or placed (at the applicant’s choice) in an existing
building, underground, or in an equipment shelter or cabinet that is (1)
designed to blend in with existing surroundings, using architecturally
compatible construction and colors; and (2) be located so as to be unobtrusive
as possible consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF.
   C.   Site Design Flexibility. Individual WCF sites vary in the location of
adjacent buildings, existing trees, topography and other local variables. By
mandating certain design standards, there may result a project that could have
been less intrusive if the location of the various elements of the project
could have been placed in more appropriate locations within a given site.
Therefore, the WCF and supporting equipment may be installed so as to best
camouflage, disguise them, or conceal them, to make the WCF more closely
compatible with and blend into the setting or host structure, upon approval by
the City.
   D.   General Standards.
      1.   Landscaping and Screening. Equipment shelters and cabinets and other
on the ground ancillary equipment shall be screened with landscaping (except
for those in the right-of-way) as required for the district in which they are
located or with another design acceptable to the City. Alternatively, where
technically feasible, the applicant shall incorporate the cabinet and other
equipment into the base of a new pole (for example, for a small wireless
facility) provided there is adequate space in the right-of-way and that ADA
sidewalk accessibility requirements can be met. All provisions of the ADA
(including, but not limited to, clear space requirements) shall be met by the
applicant.
      2.   New Poles. To the extent technically feasible, new poles must be
designed to match the existing light fixtures and other poles, and they shall
serve a dual purpose (for example, a new light fixture, flag pole or banner
clips).
   E.   Radio Frequency (RF) Emissions Compliance Report. A written report will
be prepared, signed and sealed by a Nebraska-licensed professional engineer
which assesses whether the proposed WCF demonstrates compliance with the RF
emissions limits established by the FCC. In no event shall any small wireless
facilities, either individually or collectively with those of others, exceed
the maximum permissible RF emission standards of the FCC. In the event the
FCC’s maximum permissible RF standards are exceeded, the wireless provider
shall immediately cease and desist the use of its equipment and facilities.
34-83   Independent Technical And Legal Review
Although the City intends for City staff to review applications to the extent
feasible, the City may retain the services of an independent technical expert
and attorney of its choice to provide evaluations of permit applications for
WCFs. The consultant shall have verifiable experience in the field of wireless
communication facilities. The consultant’s review may include, but is not
limited to (a) the accuracy and completeness of the items submitted with the
application; (b) the applicability of analysis and techniques and methodologies
proposed by the applicant; (c) the validity of conclusions reached by the
applicant; and (d) whether the proposed WCF complies with the applicable
approval criteria set forth in this Article. The applicant shall pay the
reasonable cost for any independent consultant fees through a deposit,
estimated by the City, within ten (10) days of the City’s request. When the
City requests such payment, the application shall be deemed incomplete for
purposes of application processing timelines until the deposit is received. In
the event that such costs and fees do not exceed the deposit amount, the City
shall refund any unused portion within thirty (30) days after the final permit
is released or, if no final permit is released, within thirty (30) days after
the City receives a written request from the applicant. If the costs and fees
exceed the deposit amount, then the applicant shall pay the difference to the
City before the permit is issued. The consultant shall provide an itemized
description of the services and related fees and charges.
34-84   Indemnification
Each permit issued for a WCF located on City property shall be deemed to have
as a condition of the permit a requirement that the applicant, registrant and
wireless provider defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City and its
officers, agents, employees, volunteers, and contractors from any and all
liability, damages, or charges (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising
out of claims, suits, demands, actions or causes of action as a result of the
permit process, a granted permit, construction, erection, location,
performance, operation, maintenance, repair, installation, replacement,
removal, or restoration of the WCF.

35-60   Purpose
The United States Environmental Protection Agency issued a Record of Decision
(ROD) for the Cleburn Street Well Superfund Site on June 7, 1996, which
identified three sources of subsurface soil and groundwater contamination.
These sources included the former One Hour Martinizing facility, Liberty
Cleaners and Shirt Launderers, and Ideal Cleaners. The former Nebraska Solvent
Company was identified as a possible fourth contamination source subject to
subsequent evaluation and testing. The ROD described selected remedies for the
three source areas, an element of which required the City of Grand Island to
enact and enforce institutional control ordinances designating a Groundwater
Control Area No. 1 in which groundwater use would be restricted to prevent
human exposure and consumption of potentially contaminated groundwater,
requiring registration of existing wells and requiring approval and
registration of new wells. The institutional control ordinances are to remain
in full force and effect until the groundwater contamination identified in the
ROD is reduced to a level making the groundwater safe to be used as a source of
drinking water pursuant to 42 USC §300g, et seq., the Safe Drinking Water Act,
or its successor legislation.
35-61   Definitions
As used in this Article, the following terms mean:
Groundwater means water pumped from a well located within the Groundwater
Control Area No. 1 described in Section
35-62.
Groundwater Contamination means the chemicals of concern (COC) described in the
United States Environmental Protection Agency Record of Decision (ROD) for the
Cleburn Street Well Superfund Site dated June 7, 1996, which was received and
accepted by the Mayor and City Council pursuant to Resolution 98-28.
Groundwater Control Area No. 1 means a defined area within the corporate limits
of the City of Grand Island subject to the institutional controls provided in
this Article which are intended to prohibit human consumption of potentially
contaminated groundwater from wells.
Well means a hole or shaft sunk into the earth in order to obtain water from a
natural subterranean supply or aquifer.
The definitions found in Neb. Rev. Stat., Chapter 46 - Irrigation and
Regulation of Water are adopted by reference, except where such definitions are
in conflict with those provided in this section above.

35-74   Purpose
The U.S. Army, in consultation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA), and the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (NDEQ), issued a
Record of Decision and Record of Decision Amendment (collectively ROD) for the
former Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant (CHAAP) which identified soil and
groundwater contamination consisting of explosives above the USEPA Health
Advisory Levels. The revised proposed plan for OU1 ROD Amendment identifies the
Preferred Remedial Alternative for remediating groundwater at Operable Unit One
(OU1) of CHAAP and provides the rational for the OU1 ROD Amendment. The
preferred remedial alternatives include remedies for the on-post and off-post
groundwater plume containing explosives. The on-post explosives plume will be
treated to remedial action objectives using existing extraction and treatment
technologies. The On-Post Plume Institutional Controls will include land use
restrictions, enforcement of the Hall County Reuse Plan for agricultural and
industrial zoning on CHAAP and prohibiting water supply well drilling in the
plume area. The Health Advisory Level in effect as of March 1, 2001, is 2ug/1
(microgram per liter) or 2 ppb (parts per billion).
Pending natural attenuation obtaining the remedial action objectives of the
ROD, the U.S. Army has requested that the City of Grand Island enact and
enforce an ordinance instituting Off-Post Plume Institutional Controls by
designating a groundwater control area in which groundwater use would be
restricted to prevent human exposure and consumption of potentially
contaminated groundwater, requiring registration of existing wells, prohibiting
installation of new wells supplying water for human consumption in the plume
area, and requiring approval and registration of new wells. The Institutional
Control Ordinance is to remain in full force and effect until the explosive
contamination identified in the ROD is attenuated to less than USEPA Health
Advisory Levels.
35-75   Definitions
As used in this Article, the following terms mean:
Groundwater means water pumped from a well located within Groundwater Control

35-84   Purpose
   A.   The Parkview Well Superfund Site (“Site”) is located in the
southwestern portion of the city of Grand Island in Hall County, Nebraska. The
Site consists of two areas of groundwater contamination and associated source
areas which resulted from the historical mismanagement of industrial solvents.
   B.   The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued an
Interim Record of Decision dated September 26, 2006 (“Interim ROD”), and a
Record of Decision dated September 30, 2007 (“Final ROD”), and an Explanation
of Significant Differences for the Site. The RODs identified two contaminant
source areas. A contaminant source area located at a facility at 3304 Engleman
Road South has resulted in contamination in the groundwater which trends to the
east. This groundwater contamination is referred to in the RODs as the Southern
Plume. A contaminant source area located at a facility at 3445 West Stolley
Park Road has resulted in groundwater contamination which trends to the east.
This groundwater contamination is referred to in the RODs as the Northern
Plume.
   C.   The RODs presented the selected remedies for the source areas and the
plumes. A component of the selected remedies in the Interim ROD is the
enactment by the City of Grand Island of an institutional control ordinance
designating a Groundwater Control Area through which groundwater use would be
restricted to prevent human exposure and consumption of contaminated
groundwater and prohibit the installation of new wells supplying water for
human consumption in the plume areas. This institutional control ordinance is
to remain in full force and effect until the groundwater contamination
identified in the RODs is reduced to a level making the groundwater safe to be
used as a source of drinking water pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42
U.S.C. §§ 300f – 300j-26, or its successor legislation.

feet and all accessory buildings shall meet the prescribed setback within the
zoning district. This shall apply similarly at triple frontage lots, provided
the remaining two frontages are treated like a typical corner lot.
      2.   Where principal structures face different directions along both
frontages, the rear yard setback for fences and screening shall be the same as
any prescribed rear yard setback within the zoning district. This shall apply
similarly at triple frontage lots, provided the remaining two frontages are
treated like a typical corner lot. All accessory buildings in this condition,
shall comply with the minimum rear yard setbacks rather than the reduced
setback allowed for accessory buildings.

extensions, expansions, and the remodeling or rebuilding of such structures or
extensions or expansions of a land use in all cases where a refusal to do so
would bring hardship to the owner or occupants and in all cases where justice
requires the granting of the same. The city council may attach appropriate

hereafter changed, any then existing nonconforming use in such changed district
may be continued or changed to a use permitted in that zoning district,
provided, all other regulations governing the new use are complied with.

Intent . The (AG-1) Primary Agricultural Zoning District regulations are
intended to provide for the preservation of lands best suited for agricultural
uses of all types including feed lots and the commercial feeding of livestock
and accessory uses; to prevent encroachment of uses of land that could be
mutually incompatible and continue to provide for agricultural uses as a major
asset to the economy of the area of the use and conservation of agricultural
land, to protect the value of such land, and to protect it from indiscriminate
residential and urban development and other incompatible and conflicting land
uses. The (AG-1) Primary Agricultural Zoning District is also intended to
conserve and protect the value of open space, wooded areas, streams, mineral
deposits and other natural resources and to protect them from incompatible land
uses and to provide for their timely utilization. The zoning district intends
to provide for the location and to govern the establishment and operation of
land uses that are compatible with agriculture and are of such nature that
their location away from residential, commercial and industrial areas is most
desirable. In addition, to provide for the location and to govern the
establishment of residential uses which are accessory to and necessary for the
conduct of agriculture and to provide the location and to govern the
establishment and use of limited non-agricultural residential uses. Such non-
agricultural residential uses shall not be so located as to be detrimental to
or conflict with other uses that are named as permitted or conditional uses in
this zoning district and are appropriate to other property in the area.
The nature of the (AG-1) Primary Agricultural Zoning District and the uses
allowed outright or by conditional use permit precludes the provision of

            (3)   All other changes in the final development plan as approved
by the city council must be made by the city council under the procedures
authorized under Article X for amendment of the Official Zoning Map; no changes
may be made in the final development plan unless they are found by the city
council to be required for the continued successful functioning of the

36-80   (GCO) Gateway Corridor Overlay District
Intent . The City of Grand Island has established basic site and building
development criteria to be implemented within the boundaries of this overlay
district. These criteria include, but are not limited to the following:
landscaping, building material selection, lighting, and interior street
development. The purpose for regulating these issues is to provide for a
cohesive and properly developed entrance into the City of Grand Island from the
Interstate corridor. Guiding development in this manner promotes the general
health, safety and welfare of the residents within the zoning jurisdiction of
the City, by providing quality design and construction that will also aid in
the protection of past and future investment in the corridor.
Purpose . The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those
items that affect the physical aspect of Grand Island's environment. Pertinent
to appearance is the design of the site, building and structures, planting,
signs, street hardware, and miscellaneous other objects that are observed by
the public.
The criteria contained herein are not intended to restrict imagination,
innovation or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles
that can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual
appearance within the city, preserve taxable values, and promote the public
health, safety and welfare.
   A.   Geographic Area . The Gateway Corridor Overlay District extends
generally to Wood River Road or the southern portion of the Grand Island
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. The overlay districts generally are one-half
mile wide and centered along U.S. Highway 281 south of Schimmer Drive and South
Locust Street south of U.S. Highway 34.
If a site is partially covered by said overlay district, and then the entire
portion of the site facing the Gateway Corridor is to be covered by these
regulations. For a graphically defined area, see the Official Zoning Map.
   B.   Criteria For Application .
      1.   All commercial developments consisting of more than one principal
building, mixed-uses, multiple-pad development and/or similar shall be required
to meet the zoning requirements for a Commercial Development Zone or the Travel
Development Zone. The Commercial Development Zone or Travel Development Zone
process and rezoning shall be in conjunction with preliminary and final plat
review and approval. The design criteria of this section shall be met as part
of the subdivision approval.
      2.   All industrial developments consisting of more than one principal
building, mixed-uses, multiple-pad development and/or similar shall be required
to meet the zoning requirements of the Industrial Estates Zone. The design
criteria of this section shall be met as part of the subdivision approval.
      3.   All commercial or industrial developments consisting of one
principal building with single or mixed uses in an existing zone shall comply
with the design criteria of this section. This would include additions and
exterior remodeling of existing structures.
      4.   All residential subdivisions shall be required to meet the landscape
and site treatment criteria whenever the proposed development is adjacent to an
arterial or frontage road. The criteria shall be implemented for the entire
frontage, including entrances into the development.
EXCEPTIONS: Single-family dwelling units within this overlay on property zoned
for Agricultural or Transition Agriculture shall be exempted from these
criteria.
   C.   Criteria for Appearance .

36-91   Fees
36-88   Conditional Uses; Application
An application for a conditional use, signed by the property owner or by a
purchaser thereof under contract in writing duly executed by both buyer and
seller, or by agent of any of the foregoing duly authorized to do so in
writing, shall be submitted to the city clerk. The application shall state the
location of the proposed conditional use, the specific conditional use
requested as permitted by this chapter and shall be accompanied by such other
material as necessary to explain the proposal. The city council may request
additional information as it deems proper.
36-89   Authorized Conditional Uses
The following uses may be granted by the city council as a permitted
conditional use in accordance with the procedure as set forth in this article:
   A.   To permit uses as listed under the permitted conditional uses within
the respective zoning districts as specified in this chapter;
   B.   To permit the appropriate use of a lot less in area by not more than
ten percent of the area required by this chapter;
   C.   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities
required by not more than two parking spaces or one loading berth or twenty
percent of the required number, whichever is greater;
   D.   To permit the same off-street parking facilities to qualify as required
spaces for two or more uses, provided, the substantial use of such spaces by
each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of the same days
of the week;
   E.   To permit temporary buildings and uses for periods not to exceed two
years in undeveloped areas of the City, and for periods not to exceed six (6)
months in developed areas;
   F.   To permit the placement and operation of wind turbines, solar energy
collectors, or other energy saving devices that would not be in conformance
with the space limitations as specified in this chapter.
   G.   To permit the construction and operation of a private wastewater
treatment system for any use within the zoning jurisdiction of the City of
Grand Island, excepting those small systems consisting of a septic tank and
drainfield having a design capacity of less than 2,000 gallons per day. The
design capacity shall be based on the table of estimated waste/sewerage flow
rates in
Chapter 30 of this code.
   H.   To permit the keeping of livestock on residential property with less
than a half acre of outdoor enclosure area per animal for periods not to exceed
three (3) years in accordance with requirements set out in §
5-16 of this code.
   I.   To permit operation of a salvage yard where allowed under the permitted
conditional uses within the respective districts; provided, that salvage
operations conducted entirely within a building as an accessory use to a
permitted principal use of land shall not require compliance with this article.
36-90   Conditional Uses; Procedure
After receipt of a conditional use application and application fee, the city
clerk shall schedule a public hearing before the city council to consider such
application. Notice of such application shall be placed in a newspaper of
general circulation in the city at least one time ten days prior to such
hearing. In addition to the publication, the city clerk shall cause a notice to
be posted in a conspicuous place on the property on which action is pending.
Such notice shall not be less than eighteen inches in height and twenty-four
inches in width with a white or yellow background and black letters not less
than one and one-half inches in height. Such posted notice shall be so placed
upon the premises that it is easily visible from the street nearest the same
and shall be so posted at least ten days prior to the date of such hearing. It
shall be unlawful for anyone to remove, mutilate, destroy, or change such
posted notice prior to such hearing. Any person so doing shall be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor. The hearing shall be held at which all interested parties
shall be heard.
The city council may grant, grant with any conditions or safeguards upon the
property benefitted by a conditional use, or deny the application. Violation of
any such conditions or safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which
the conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a misdemeanor. No conditional
use permitting the erection or alteration of a building or other use shall be
valid for a period longer than one year unless the building is erected or
altered or the use established within that period.
The city administrator or any department director having a personal knowledge
of any violation of a permitted conditional use or a condition or safeguard
which is made part of the terms under which a conditional use is granted, may
deliver a written request to the building department director asking that the
director issue a notice of violation and demand for compliance to the person
owning the property subject to the permitted conditional use. Upon receipt of
said written request, the building department director shall investigate the
alleged violation and if it is determined that a violation exists, the building
department director shall send a notice of violation and demand for compliance
to the last known address of said person, one copy each, by ordinary first
class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested, demanding that the
premises be brought into compliance with the conditional use by a date certain
and advising said person that in the event violations continue after said date,
that a request for revocation of the conditional use will be forwarded to the
city council for a public hearing and determination. The written notice shall
include a description of the violations and the underlying facts supporting
such allegations.
If the violations stated in the foregoing notice and demand are not eliminated
and the property brought into compliance with the city code and the permitted
conditional use by the date certain, the building department director shall
send such person a notice of hearing before the city council to consider
revocation of the conditional use permit. The public hearing shall be conducted
formally. The building department director, city attorney or their respective
designees shall present oral or written statements or reasons supporting
revocation of the permitted conditional use. The property owner(s) or designee
(s) shall present oral or written statements or reasons opposing the revocation
of the permitted conditional use. Statements by each side shall be limited to a
total time of one hour or less. Any interested person may be heard following
presentations on behalf of the city and the property owner. Upon conclusion of
the hearing, the city council may affirm, revoke, or modify the permitted
existing use.
36-91   Fees
At the time of filing of an application for a conditional use permit with the
city clerk, the applicant shall pay to the city treasurer a processing fee, as
provided in the City of Grand Island Fee Schedule, which shall not be
refundable.

   A.   Purposes .
      1.   It is the intent of this section that all buildings and uses shall
provide off-street parking and loading facilities in a minimum amount as
required herein to meet the needs of such buildings and uses on private
property and under the same ownership as such buildings or uses. The
accommodations may consist of lots, garages, or other buildings, and
accessories; they may be surface facilities or facilities above or under the
ground.
      2.   It is the further intent of this section that all off-street parking
and loading spaces and facilities shall be sited and built according to the
requirements contained in this section, and shall require an application for
and issuance of a building permit pursuant to §
8-22.
   B.   Application . Each building or use hereafter constructed, and each
addition to or altered building or use shall be provided with off-street
parking and loading spaces as required herein. Each off-street parking space or
loading facility and space hereafter constructed, upon proper application and
permit being granted shall be sited and constructed pursuant to the
requirements of this section. No application for a building permit for such
building, addition, alteration, or use shall be approved unless accompanied by
a plot plan showing the location and amount of off-street parking and loading
spaces as required herein for the existing or proposed building or use and
including all such additions or alterations. No occupancy or use permit shall
be issued unless the required parking and loading facilities shall have been
provided in accordance with the approved plot plan. Requirements shall be
applicable to all zones and districts but not to include the following business
districts or tracts of land as identified below:
      1.   Central Business District . Beginning at the intersection of
Sycamore Street and First Street; thence westerly on First Street to Pine
Street; thence southerly on Pine Street to the southerly boundary of Courthouse
Addition; thence westerly along the southerly boundary of Courthouse Addition
to Locust Street; thence westerly on Division Street to Walnut Street; thence
northerly on Walnut Street to the alley between Division Street and First
Street; thence westerly on said alley to Cedar Street; thence northerly on
Cedar Street to the alley between Second Street and Third Street; thence
westerly on said alley to Elm Street; thence northerly on Elm Street to a point
40 feet north of the southerly right-of-way line of the Union Pacific Railroad;
thence easterly parallel to and 40 feet from said right-of-way line to Walnut
Street; thence northerly on Walnut Street to a point 100 feet north of the
northerly right-of-way line of South Front Street; thence easterly parallel to
and 100 feet from said right-of-way line to Kimball Avenue extended; thence
southerly on Kimball Avenue extended and Kimball Avenue to the alley between
Third Street and Second Street; thence southerly on Sycamore Street to the
point of beginning.
      2.   Fourth Street Business District . Beginning at the intersection of
Eddy Street and the alley in the block between Fourth and Fifth Streets; thence
easterly on the alley to the intersection of the alley with Sycamore Street;
thence southerly on Sycamore Street to 100 feet south of the south right-of-way
line of North Front Street; thence westerly on the aforesaid line to its
intersection with Eddy Street; thence northerly on Eddy Street to the point of
beginning.
      3.   Tracts of land ten acres or more used for seasonal events (one event
every three months) of not more than fourteen consecutive days in duration and
a minimum of fourteen days between events.
   C.   Area and Computation . An off-street parking space shall be of
appropriate dimensions of not less than 180 square feet exclusive of access or
maneuvering area, ramps, columns, etc., and shall have a vertical clearance of
not less than seven feet. An off-street loading space shall be of appropriate
dimensions of not less than 360 square feet exclusive of access or maneuvering
area, ramps, columns, etc., and shall have a vertical clearance of not less
than fourteen feet. When determination of the number of off-street parking or
loading spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a
fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
   D.   Location . All off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot as
the building or within 300 feet of the lot. Permanent off-street parking spaces
shall not be permitted within the required front yard setback, provided,
however, that for a building containing three dwelling units or less, one space
per unit may be placed within the front yard setback if such space is not
directly in front of the building excluding garages or carports.
   E.   Collective Facilities . Off-street parking facilities for separate or
mixed buildings or uses may be provided collectively so long as the total
number of spaces is not less than the sum of the separate required spaces
except as provided below, and provided further, that the requirement concerning
location of such facility with respect to distance from the building or use
served shall be complied with. In order to eliminate a multiplicity of
entrances and exits and diminish traffic hazards to conserve space where space
is at a premium and to promote orderly development generally, the city council
is hereby authorized to plan and group parking facilities collectively for a
number of businesses in a given area, and especially in the central business
district, in such a manner as to obtain a maximum of efficiency and capacity in
parking and traffic movement.
EXCEPTIONS:
The total number of commercial parking spaces in a collective lot may be
reduced by 25% at the time of construction if the following qualifications are
met:
The overall development is planned for at least 20 acres and the commercial
property is primarily intended to serve the neighborhood and occupies no more
than 25% of the development not to exceed 10 acres.
All spaces required for residential units must be provided at the time of
occupancy.
Provisions are made in the development for hike/bike trails through the
development with connections to the commercial node.
Adequate property exists to within the parking area to add the required spaces
if it is determined that they are needed in the future.
   F.   Employee Parking . Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall
be based on the maximum number of employees on duty on the premises at any one
time.
   G.   Design Standards. All off-street parking and loading facilities shall
be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley and
contain adequate and safe maneuvering areas. Detailed plans shall be submitted
to the public works director for approval of all curb cuts or driveway openings
before a permit may be obtained therefor. No signs shall be displayed except
such signs as required for the orderly use of the facilities. All facilities
shall be provided with a permanent type, dust-free surface meaning asphaltic
cement concrete, Portland cement concrete, or paving brick.
All parking lots containing five or more parking spaces, which are within 30
feet of property occupied by a residential use in a Large Lot Residential
Zoning District or of property within a Suburban Residential Zoning District,
Low Density Residential Zoning District, Medium Density Residential Zoning
District, High Density Residential Zoning District or Residential Development
Zoning District, shall provide a sight-obscuring fence or screen not less than
six feet nor more than eight feet in height along the boundary of the parking
lot adjacent to such districts. No fence or screen shall be required between
abutting parking lots or adjacent to an alley. The height of any fence or
screen shall be subject to other restrictions provided by the City Code.
   H.   Maintenance . The parking and loading facilities required by this
section shall be provided and maintained so long as the use exists which the
facilities are designed to serve. Reasonable precautions must be taken by the
owners of particular uses to assure the use of the parking facilities only by
the employees or the social or business visitors of the premises for which the
facilities are provided. The facilities must be so designed and maintained as
not to constitute a nuisance at any time and must not be used in such a manner
as to constitute a hazard or unreasonable impediment to traffic.
   I.   Reduction of Number of Spaces . Off-street parking or loading
facilities shall not be reduced in total extent, after their provision required
hereunder, except upon the approval of the Board of Adjustment, and then only
after proof that the parking or loading spaces are no longer required by reason
of a change in use of the premises of which the facilities are adjunct.
   J.   Requirement for Uses Not Listed . For any use not listed, the Board of
Adjustment shall determine the proper requirement by classifying the proposed
use among the uses specified herein so as to assure equal treatment.
   K.   Administration and Enforcement . The off-street parking and loading
provisions of this section shall be administered by the zoning official and
enforced by the chief building official, who shall also serve in advisory
capacity to the city council on matters relative to any phase of such
provisions.
   L.   Penalty for Violation . The provisions of parking and loading
facilities as required by this section shall be a continuing obligation of the
owner or sponsor of a given building or use so long as the building or use is
in existence and so long as parking and loading facilities are required
hereunder in connection therewith, and it shall be unlawful to discontinue,
change, or dispense with such facilities without establishing alternate
facilities that meet the requirements herein. Penalty provisions applicable to
this chapter as a whole shall apply to the violations of these provisions. In
addition, at such time as the facilities required hereunder shall fail to
continue to be available for the purpose, the building permit for the
structures to which the facilities are adjunct and the use or occupancy permits
issued for the premises shall be canceled and become null and void.

(Amended by Ordinance No. 8947, effective 1-5-2005)
36-101   Performance Standards For Industrial Uses
The following standards shall be met unless there are greater standards
required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the Nebraska
Department of Environmental Quality.
   A.   Physical Appearance . All operations shall be carried on within an
enclosed building except that new materials or equipment in operable condition
may be stored in the open. Normal daily wastes of an inorganic nature may be
stored in containers not in a building when such containers are not readily
visible from a street. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to
prohibit the display of merchandise or vehicles for sale or the storage of
vehicles, boats, farm machinery, trailers, manufactured homes, or similar
equipment when in operable condition.
   B.   Fire Hazard . No operation shall involve the use of highly flammable
gasses, acid, liquids, grinding processes, or other inherent fire hazards. This
provision shall not be construed to prohibit the use of normal heating fuels,
motor fuels and welding gasses when handled in accordance with other
regulations of the City of Grand Island.
   C.   Noise . No operation shall be carried on which involves noise in excess
of the normal traffic noise of the adjacent street at the time of the daily
peak hour of traffic volume. Noise shall be measured at the property line and
when the level of such noise cannot be determined by observation with the
natural senses, a suitable instrument may be used and measurement may include
breakdowns into a reasonable number of frequency ranges.
   D.   Sewage and Liquid Wastes . No operation shall be carried on which
involves the discharge into a sewer, water course, or the ground, liquid waste
of any radioactive or poisonous nature or chemical waste which are detrimental
to normal sewage plant operation or corrosive and damaging to sewer pipes and
installations.
   E.   Air Contaminants .
      1.   Air Contaminants and smoke shall be less dark than designated Number
One on the Ringleman Chart as published by the United States Bureau of Mines,
except that smoke of a density designated as Number One shall be permitted for
one four minute period in each one-half hour. Light colored contaminants of
such a capacity as to obscure an observer's view to a degree equal to or
greater than the aforesaid shall not be permitted.
      2.   Particulate matter of dust as measured at the point of emission by
any generally accepted method shall not be emitted in excess of two tenths
(0.2) grains per cubic foot as corrected to a temperature of 500 degrees
Fahrenheit, except for a period of four minutes in any one-half hour, at which
time it may equal but not exceed six tenths (0.6) grains per cubic foot as
corrected to a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
      3.   Due to the fact that the possibilities of air contamination cannot
reasonably be comprehensively covered in this section, there shall be applied
the general rule that there shall not be discharged from any sources whatsoever
such quantities of air contaminants or other material in such quantity as to
cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of
persons or to the public in general; or to endanger the comfort, repose,
health, or safety of any such considerable number of persons or to the public
in general, or to cause, or have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage
to business, vegetation, or property.
      4.   Odor . The emission of odors that are generally agreed to be
obnoxious to any considerable numbers of persons, shall be prohibited.
Observations of odor shall be made at the property line of the establishment
causing the odor. As a guide to classification of odor it shall be deemed that
strong odors of putrefaction and fermentation tend to be obnoxious and that
such odors as associated with baking or the roasting of nuts and coffee shall
not normally be considered obnoxious within the meaning of this regulation.
      5.   Gasses . The gasses sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide shall not
exceed five (5) parts per million, carbon monoxide shall not exceed five (5)
parts per million. All measurements shall be taken at the zoning lot line.
      6.   Vibration . All machines including punch presses and stamping
machines shall be so mounted as to minimize vibration and in no case shall such
vibration exceed a displacement of three thousands (0.003) of an inch measured
at the zoning lot line. The use of steam or broad hammers shall not be
permitted in this zone.
      7.   Glare and heat . All glare, such as welding arcs and open furnaces
shall be shielded so that they shall not be visible from the zoning lot line.
No heat from furnaces or processing equipment shall be sensed at the zoning lot
line to the extent of raising the temperature of air or materials more than
five (5) degrees Fahrenheit.
   F.   Physical Appearance . Salvage yards and other similar operations shall
be effectively enclosed or shielded from adjacent properties on all sides by
means of a sight-obscuring fence at least eight (8) feet in height, in good
repair, and constructed of conventional fence building materials and techniques
as approved by the chief building official. No inventory or salvage materials
of any nature may be stacked within fifty (50.0) feet of the fence to a height
greater than said fence.
(Amended by Ordinance No. 9151, effective 12-18-2007)
36-102   Landscaping Requirements
   A.   Purpose . The landscaping and screening regulations are intended to
improve the physical appearance of the community; to improve the environmental
performance of new development by contributing to the abatement of heat, noise,
glare, wind and dust; to promote natural percolation of storm water and
improvement of air quality; to buffer potentially incompatible uses from one
another; and, to protect and enhance the value of property and neighborhoods
within the city.
   B.   Applicability .
      1.   The provisions of this section shall apply to the following zones:

Commercial Development Zone, Residential Development Zone and Travel
Development Zone. Landscaping of lands within districts such as the Central
Business District and Fourth Street Business District, as defined elsewhere in
this code and/or below, shall be exempt from this section. Properties subject
to Streetscape Improvement Projects supported by Business Improvement Districts
created for the purpose of establishing and/or maintaining district wide
landscaping plans shall be exempt from this section as long as the Business
Improvement District is in effect.

shade or ornamental tree to conform to standards of wildlife management
required near an airport.
      3.   The provisions of this section shall apply to all new development,
including surface parking, on each lot or site upon application for a building
permit, except as follows:
         a.   Reconstruction or replacement of a lawfully existing use or
structure.
         b.   Remodeling, rehabilitation or improvements to existing uses or
structures which do not substantially change the location or building footprint
of existing structures, or the location and design of parking facilities or
other site improvements. However, additions or enlargements of existing uses or
structures, which increase floor area or impervious coverage by more than 25%
adjacent to the existing street frontage, shall be subject to the provisions of
this section, which shall only apply to that portion of the lot or site where
the new development or use occurs.
         c.   Residential structures containing three dwelling units on a
single lot, or less shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.
      4.   Landscaping which exists on any property shall not be altered or
reduced below the minimum requirements of this section, unless suitable
substitutions are made which meet the requirements of this section, pursuant to
a site plan approved by the city.
      5.   Any conflict between this section and another section of this
chapter shall be resolved in favor of the more restrictive provision.
   C.   Nonconforming Status . Any property or use of property, which as of

regulations relating to landscaping, may be continued in the same manner as if
the landscaping were conforming.
   D.   Definitions . The following definitions shall be used for terms
contained within this section:
Buffer yard. A landscaped area provided to separate and significantly obstruct
the view of two adjacent land uses or properties from one another.
Canopy tree . A deciduous tree having a minimum mature height of 30 feet and a
minimum caliper of 1 inch at the time of planting. One canopy tree equals two
understory/ornamental or evergreen trees.
Evergreen tree . An evergreen or conifer tree having a minimum mature height of
20 feet and a minimum 2 gallon container size or bare root/ball equivalent at
the time of planting.
Landscaped area . That area within the boundaries of a given lot consisting
primarily of plant material, including but not limited to grass, trees, shrubs,
flowers, vines, groundcover and other organic plant materials (this does not
include plant materials typically used as a cash crop). Tall varieties of
native and ornamental grasses may be planted and left in their natural state in
selective and limited locations, deemed appropriate by the city. Inorganic
materials such as brick, stones, aggregate, ponds or fountains may be used
within landscaped areas, provided that such materials comprise no more than 35
percent of the required landscaped area. Flat concrete or asphalt, other than
walkways five feet or less in width, may not be used within a required
landscaped area.
Minimum equivalent street landscaping . The minimum landscaped area which must
be provided in a street yard, expressed as a percent of the total area
contained within that street yard.
Shrub . A deciduous or evergreen plant having a minimum height of 18 inches at
the time of planting, with a maximum mature height of less than 10 feet.
Street yard .
      1.   The area of a lot or parcel which lies between any street property
line and the fronting walls of any building or buildings on the parcel. The
street yard shall follow all irregularities or indentations in the front wall
of the building, excluding minor projections or indentations such as steps or
unenclosed porches. For the purposes of defining the street yard area, the
front wall shall be extended from the outermost corners of the building,
parallel with the fronting street, until intersecting with the side property
line [see Attachment B hereto]. Street yard depth shall not exceed 100 feet for
the purposes of calculating the minimum equivalent street landscaping area
requirement.
      2.   On lots or parcels with multiple buildings, the street yard area
shall be defined by all building front walls having direct, visual frontage
onto the street. Any space between buildings equal to 15 percent of the length
of such frontage, but in no case more than 100 feet, shall be considered an
extension of the continuous building front wall for the purpose of delineating
the street yard.
Understory/ornamental tree . A flowering or non-flowering deciduous tree having
a maximum mature height of 30 feet and a minimum caliper of 2 inch at the time
of planting.

36-127   Amendments
36-128   Definitions
36-117   Statutory Authorization, Findings Of Fact And Purposes
   A.   Statutory Authorization . The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning
regulations designed to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has in Sections 31-1001 to 31-1022,
R.R.S. 1943 assigned the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
floodplain management regulations designed to protect the public health, safety
and general welfare.
   B.   Findings of Fact .
      1.   Flood Losses Resulting From Periodic Inundation . The flood hazard
areas of Grand Island, Nebraska, are subject to inundation which results in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      2.   General Causes of the Flood Losses . These flood losses are caused
by: (a) The cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases
in flood heights and velocities, (b) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by
uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others, which are inadequately
elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
      3.   Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards . This Article uses a
reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of
interrelated steps.
         a.   Selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected
frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The
base flood is selected for this Article. It is representative of large floods
which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the
particular streams subject to this Article. It is in the general order of a
flood which could be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence
in any one year, as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood
Insurance Study, and illustrative materials dated March 2, 1983 as amended, and
any future revisions thereto.
         b.   Calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic
engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas
to convey the base flood.
         c.   Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point.
         d.   Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the
floodway profile.
         e.   Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the
floodway encroachment lines, but which still is subject to inundation by the
base flood.
   C.   Statement of Purpose . It is the purpose of this Article to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize those losses
described in §
36-117(B)(1) herein by applying the provisions of this Article to:
      1.   Restrict or prohibit uses, which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or
velocities.
      2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities,
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
construction.
      3.   Protect individuals from buying lands, which are unsuited for
intended purposes because of flood hazard.
      4.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.
36-118   General Provisions
   A.   Lands to Which Article Applies . This Article shall apply to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the City of Grand Island identified on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated September 26, 2008, and any revisions thereto,
as numbered and unnumbered A Zones (including AE, AO and AH Zones) and within
the Zoning Districts FW and FF established in §
36-120 of this chapter. In all areas covered by this Article, no development
shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain permit to develop,
granted by the City Council or its duly designated representative under such
safeguards and restrictions as the City Council or the designated
representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the
general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where
specifically noted in §
36-121,
36-122, and
36-123 herein.
   B.   The Enforcement Officer . The Building Director and/or Planning
Director of the community, or their designee is hereby designated as the
community's duly designated Enforcement Officer under this Article.
   C.   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries . The boundaries of the
floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling
distances on the Official Zoning Map or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map or
Floodway Map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the
boundaries of the districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, as for example
where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions, the Enforcement Officer shall make the necessary interpretation. In
such cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board of Adjustment will
resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood elevation for the point in question
shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land.
The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board of Adjustment and to
submit his own technical evidence, if he so desires.
   D.   Compliance . Within identified special flood hazard areas of this
community, no development shall be located, extended, converted or structurally
altered without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other
applicable regulations.
   E.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions . It is not intended by this
Article to repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this Article imposes greater restrictions,
the provision of this Article shall prevail. All other sections inconsistent
with this Article are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   F.   Interpretation . In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this Article shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall
be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes.
   G.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability . The degree of flood protection
required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
Article does not imply that areas outside floodway and flood fringe district
boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This Article shall not create liability on the part
of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may
result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
   H.   Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this
Article is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the remainder of this Article shall not be affected thereby.
   I.   Appeal . Where a request for a permit to develop or a variance is
denied by the Building Director and/or Planning Director, the applicant may
apply for such permit or variance directly to the Board of Adjustment.
36-119   Development Permit
   A.   Permit Required . No person, firm or corporation shall initiate any
floodplain development or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done
without first obtaining a separate permit for development.
   B.   Administration .
      1.   The Building Director and/or Planning Director or their designee, is
hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this Article.
      2.   Duties of the Building Director and/or Planning Director shall
include, but not be limited to:
         a.   Review all development permit applications to assure that the
permit requirements of this Article have been satisfied.
         b.   Require verification, record and maintain record of the actual
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including
basement) of all new or substantially improved structures in special flood
hazard areas.
         c.   Require verification, record and maintain record of the actual
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which new or substantially
improved structures have been floodproofed.
         d.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure the
Building Director and/or Planning Director shall be presented certification
from a registered professional engineer as to the floodproof design.
   C.   Application for Permit . To obtain a floodplain development permit, the
applicant shall first file an application in writing on a form furnished for
that purpose. Every such application shall:
      1.   Identify and describe the development to be covered by the
floodplain development permit.
      2.   Describe the land on which the proposed development is to be done by
lot, block, tract and house and street address, or similar description that
will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed building or
development.
      3.   Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed development is
intended.
      4.   Be accompanied by plans and specifications for proposed
construction.
      5.   Be signed by the permittee or his authorized agent who may be
required to submit evidence to indicate such authority.
      6.   Give such other information as reasonably may be required by the
Building Director and/or Planning Director.
36-120   Establishment Of Zoning Districts
Along watercourses where a floodway has been established, the mapped floodplain
areas are hereby divided into the two following overlay districts: A floodway
overlay district (FW) and a flood fringe overlay district (FF) as identified in
the Flood Insurance Study [and accompanying map(s)]. Within these districts all
new uses not meeting the standards of this Article and those standards of the
underlying zoning district shall be prohibited.
36-121   Standards For Floodplain Development
   A.   No permit for development shall be granted for new construction,
substantial improvements and other development(s) including the placement of
manufactured homes within all numbered and unnumbered A zones (including AE,
AO, and AH zones) unless the conditions of this Section are satisfied.
   B.   All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to
inundation of the base flood; however, the water surface elevation was not
provided. The unnumbered A zones shall be subject to all development provisions
of this chapter. If Flood Insurance Study data is not available, the community
shall utilize any base flood elevation or floodplain data currently available
from Federal, State or other sources.
   C.   Until a floodway has been designated, no development or substantial
improvement may be permitted within special flood hazard areas unless the
applicant has demonstrated that the proposed development or substantial
improvement, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated
developments or substantial improvements, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any location as shown on
the Flood Insurance Study.
   D.   New construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements,
prefabricated buildings, placement of manufactured homes and other developments
shall require:
      1.   Design or anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      2.   New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage
systems be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site
waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamination.
      3.   Construction with materials resistant to flood damage, utilizing
methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other
service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
      4.   All utility and sanitary facilities be elevated or flood-proofed up
to the regulatory flood protection elevation.
   E.   Storage of Material and Equipment .
      1.   The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding
buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal or plant
life is prohibited.
      2.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject
to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
   F.   Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, be required to assure that (a) all
such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, (b) all
public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage, (c) adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards, and (d) proposals for development (including proposals for
manufactured home parks and subdivision) of five acres or fifty lots, whichever
is lesser, include within such proposals the base flood elevation.
36-122   Flood Fringe Overlay District -- Including AO And AH Zones
   A.   Permitted Uses . Any use permitted in §
36-123 shall be permitted in the Flood Fringe Overlay District. No use shall be
permitted in the overlay district unless the standards of §
36-121 are met.
   B.   Standards for the Flood Fringe Overlay District .
      1.   Require new construction or substantial improvements of residential
structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
one foot above the base flood elevation. Uninhabited garage floors shall be at
or above the base flood elevation.
      2.   Require new construction or substantial improvements of non-
residential structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
to or above one foot above the base flood elevation, or together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities, to be floodproofed so that below that level
the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage
of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer shall certify that the design standards of this section
are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Building Director
and/or Planning Director as set forth in §
36-119.
      3.   Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be not higher than one foot
above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      4.   Within AH zones, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes
shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      5.   Manufacturing.
         a.   All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist floatation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Manufactured homes must be anchored in
accordance with local building codes or FEMA guidelines. In the event that
over-the-top frame ties to ground anchors are used, the following specific
requirements (or their equivalent) shall be met:
            (1)   Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four corners of
the manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate
locations and manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring one
additional tie per side.
            (2)   Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five
additional ties per side at intermediate points and manufactured homes less
than 50 feet long requiring four additional ties per side.
            (3)   All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying
a force of 4,800 pounds
            (4)   Any additions to the manufactured home be similarly anchored.
         b.   Require that all manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved within special flood hazard areas on the community's FIRM on sites:
            (1)   Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision
            (2)   In a new manufactured home park or subdivision
            (3)   In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision, or
            (4)   In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which
a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood,
be elevated such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above
one foot above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
         c.   Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within
special flood hazard areas on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the
provisions of this section be elevated so that either:
            (1)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above one
foot above the base flood elevation, or
            (2)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no
less than 36 inches in height above grade; and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with provisions of this
section.
      6.   Recreation vehicles placed on sites within the special flood hazard
areas on the community's official map shall either (i) be on the site for fewer
than 180 consecutive days, (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
(iii) meet the permit requirements and the elevation and anchoring requirements
for "manufactured homes" of this chapter. A recreational vehicle is ready for
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions.
      7.   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
36-118 area areas designated as AO zones. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply within AO zones:

the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or
            (2)   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that
level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Such certification
shall be provided to the official as set forth in §
36-119.
         c.   Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be
required in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed

36-123   Floodway Overlay District
   A.   Permitted Uses . Only uses having a low flood-damage potential and not
obstructing flood flows shall be permitted within the Floodway District to the
extent that they are not prohibited by any other section. The following are
recommended uses for the Floodway District:
      1.   Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, nurseries,
forestry.
      2.   Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking and play areas.
      3.   Non-residential areas such as loading areas, parking and airport

including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development must be prohibited unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that the
development shall not result in any increase in water surface elevations along
the floodway profile during occurrence of the base flood discharge. These uses
are subject to the standards of §
36-121 and §
36-122.
36-124   Variance Procedures
   A.   The Board of Adjustment as established by the City of Grand Island
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements
of this Article.
   B.   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide when it is alleged that
there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the
Building Director and/or Planning Director in the enforcement or administration
of this Article.
   C.   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court as provided in state
law.
   D.   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider all technical evaluation, all relevant factors, standards specified in
other sections of this chapter; and
      1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      5.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      6.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and
      11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   E.   Conditions for Variances .
      1.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items 8.52-8.56 below) have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      2.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
      3.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels along the floodway profile during the base flood
discharge would result.
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws.
      6.   The applicant shall be given a written notice over the signature of
a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage,
and such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required by this Article.
36-125   Nonconforming Uses
   A.   A structure or the use of a structure or premises as of August 1, 2004
or amendment of the chapter, but which is not in conformity with the provisions
of this Article may be continued subject to the following conditions:
      1.   If such use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this Article.
      2.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   B.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred except
that if it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this Article.
This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes or
regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places, provided
that the alteration shall not preclude its continued designation.
36-126   Penalties For Violation
Violation of the provisions of this Article or failure to comply with any of
its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances or special exceptions) shall constitute
a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Article or fails to comply with any
of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than
$100.00, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the
case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city or other appropriate authority
from taking such other lawful action is as necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.
36-127   Amendments
The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this Article may
from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any
and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973,
provided, however, that no such action may be taken until after a public
hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens shall
have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. At least
10 days shall elapse between the date of this publication and the public
hearing. A copy of such amendments will be provided to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. These regulations are in compliance with the National Flood
Insurance Program Regulations as published in Title 44 of the Code of Federal
Regulations and the 1983 Nebraska Flood Plain Management Act.
36-128   Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this Article its most reasonable application:
Appeal means a request for a review of the Building Director and/or Planning
Director interpretation of any provision of this Article or a request for a
variance.
Area of Shallow Flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of
flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding
is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Base Flood means the flood having one percent chance of being equalled or
exceeded in any given year.
Basement means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
Existing Construction means (for the purposes of determining rates) structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of
the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRM's effective before that date.
"Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures."
Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision means a manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots
on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is complete before August 26, 1974.
Flood or Flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
   B.   The usual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any
source.
Flood Fringe is that area of the floodplain, outside of the floodway, that on
the average is likely to be flooded once every 100 years (i.e., that has a one
percent chance of flood occurrence in any one year).
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which
the Flood Insurance Study has delineated the Flood Hazard Boundaries and the
zones establishing insurance rates applicable to the community.
Flood Insurance Study is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the Flood
Boundary Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any
source (see definition of "flooding").
Floodway or Regulatory Floodway means the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot.
Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of
urbanization of the watershed.
Highest Adjacent Grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground
surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Historic Structure means any structure that is: (a) Listed individually in the
National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of
Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as
meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; (b)
Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as
contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district

approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or (d) Individually listed on a
local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation
programs that have been certified either: (1) By an approved state program as
determined by the Secretary of the Interior or (2) Directly by the Secretary of
the Interior in states without approved programs.
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
Manufactured Home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle".
Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
New Construction . For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means
structures for which the "start of construction commenced on or after August
26, 1974.
Overlay District is a district in which additional requirements act in
conjunction with the underlying zoning district. The underlying zoning district
designation does not change.
Principally Above Ground means that at least 51 percent of the actual cash
value of the structure is above ground.
Recreational Vehicle means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis;
(ii) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
Special Flood Hazard Area is the land in the floodplain within a community
subject to one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Start of Construction [for other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)] includes
substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground,
as well as a manufactured home, and a gas or liquid storage tank that is
principally above ground.
Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
Substantial Improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions,
or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure."
Variances is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
Article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
Article where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

The board of adjustment shall adopt rules necessary for the conduct of its
affairs and in keeping with the provisions of this chapter.
36-137   Meetings
Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such
other times as the board may determine. Such chairman, or in his or her absence
the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of
witnesses. All meetings of the board shall be open to the public.

36-139   Appeal
Appeals to the board may be taken by any person aggrieved by any officer,
department, board, or bureau of the City affected by any decision of an
administrative officer, provided, such appeal shall be taken within ten days
after the decision of the administrative officer, by filing with the office
from whom the appeal is taken, and with the clerk of the board, written notice
of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is
taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record
upon which the action appealed from was taken.

Prior to the filing of the appeal with the clerk of the board and the
administrative officer from whose decision the appeal is requested, the
appellant shall pay to the city treasurer a processing fee, as provided by a
fee schedule approved by the city council, which shall not be refundable.
36-142   Powers And Limitations
The board of adjustment shall, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards
as may be established by the city council, have the following powers:
   A.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation
or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures.
   B.   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of any zoning
regulation, requests for interpretation of any map, or for decisions upon other
special questions upon which the board is authorized by any such regulation to
pass.
   C.   Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a
specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning
regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property,
the strict application of any enacted regulation under this chapter would
result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional
and undue hardships upon the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an
appeal relating to the property, a variance from such strict application so as
to relieve such difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing
the intent and purpose of this code or any ordinance or resolution. No such
variance shall be authorized by the board unless it finds that:
      1.   The strict application of the zoning regulations would produce undue
hardship;
      2.   Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the
same zoning district and the same vicinity;
      3.   The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be
changed by the granting of variance; and
      4.   The granting of such variance is based upon reason of demonstrable
and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of
convenience, profit, or caprice.
No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or
situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not
of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the
formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the zoning
regulations.
36-143   Action And Vote Required
In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision, or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of
the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members
of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such
regulation or to effect any variation in such regulation.
36-144   Appeals To District Court
Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the
Board of Adjustment may appeal as provided by Section 19-912, Reissue Revised
Statutes of 1943 (in full).

title owners of any lots included in such proposed change be nonresidents of
the municipality, then a written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by
certified mail to them addressed to their last known addresses at least ten
days prior to such hearing. The provisions requiring that notice be posted on
the premises to be rezoned shall not apply in the event of a proposed change in
such regulations, restrictions, or boundaries throughout the entire area of an
existing zoning district or of such municipality, or in the event additional or
different types of zoning districts are proposed, whether or not such
additional or different districts are made applicable to areas, or parts of
areas, already within a zoning district of the municipality; but the only
requirement then shall be the publication of the notice in the newspaper as
provided in this section. The city council shall approve or disapprove the
proposed amendment. A majority vote of all the members of the city council
shall be required to adopt any zoning amendment. Notice of the final action
shall be sent to the applicant and one copy shall be sent to the planning
commission.
36-152   Amendment; Protest; Limitation
In case of a protest against such zoning district change, signed by owners of
twenty percent or more, either of the area of the lots included in such
proposed change or of those immediately adjacent on the sides and in the rear
thereof extending three hundred feet therefrom, and of those directly opposite
thereto extending three hundred feet from the street frontage of such opposite
lots, such amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of
three-fourths of all the members of the city council. Whenever a change of land
use has been finally disapproved by the city council, neither the planning
commission nor the city council shall consider the same or similar application
for change of land use affecting the same property for a period of six months
from the date of such disapproval by the city council.

36-168   Purpose
The Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996
(the Act) grants the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) jurisdiction over
certain aspects of telecommunications services. This Article is intended to
regulate macro cell towers, telecommunications facilities and antennas in the
City in conformance with the Act without prohibiting or intending to prohibit
any person from providing wireless communications services. Telecommunications
facilities, towers and antennas in the City shall be constructed in a way to
protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impact through
careful design, siting, and camouflaging, to promote and encourage shared use/
collocation of towers and other antenna support structures rather than the
construction of additional single use towers, to avoid potential damage to
property caused by towers, telecommunications facilities and antennas by
ensuring such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed,
modified, maintained, repaired and removed when no longer used or are
determined to be structurally unsound and to ensure that towers and antennas
are compatible with surrounding land uses.

application. Notice of such application shall be placed in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City at least one (1) time ten (10) days prior to
such hearing. In addition to the publication, the City Clerk shall cause a
notice to be posted in a conspicuous place on the property on which action is
pending. Such notice shall be not less than eighteen (18) inches in height and
twenty four (24) inches in width with a white or yellow background and black
letters not less than one and one-half (1 1/2) inches in height. Such posted
notice shall be so placed upon the premises so that it is easily visible from
the street nearest the same and shall be so posted at least ten (10) days prior
to the date of such hearing. It shall be unlawful for anyone to remove,
mutilate, destroy, or change such posted notice prior to such hearing. Any
person so doing shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. The public hearing
shall be held at which all interested parties shall be heard. The City Council
may approve a Tower Development Permit as requested in the pending application
with any conditions or safeguards it deems reasonable and appropriate based
upon the application and input received at the public hearing or deny the
application. In all zoning districts in which towers are a permitted
conditional use of land, the Tower Development Permit shall be deemed a
conditional use permit for said tract of land.
36-173   Preferred Tower Locations
   A.   All new towers are permitted only after application of the following
siting priorities, ordered from most-preferred (1) to least-preferred (5):
      1.   manufacturing zones;
      2.   commercial zones;
      3.   other non-residential zoning districts;
      4.   parcels of land in residential zoning districts;
      5.   designated historic districts.
   B.   The applicant for a tower shall address these preferences in an
alternative sites analysis prepared pursuant to §
36-174 below.
36-174   Alternative Sites Analysis
   A.   For a tower, the applicant must address the City’s preferred tower
locations with a detailed explanation justifying why a site of higher priority
was not selected. The City’s tower location preferences must be addressed in a
clear and complete written alternative sites analysis that shows at least three
(3) higher ranked, alternative sites considered that are in the geographic
range of the service coverage objectives of the applicant, together with a
factually detailed and meaningful comparative analysis between each alternative
candidate and the proposed site that explains the substantive reasons why the
applicant rejected the alternative candidate.
   B.   A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this subsection
may include less than three (3) alternative sites so long as the applicant
provides a factually detailed written rationale for why it could not identify
at least three (3) potentially available, higher ranked, alternative sites.
   C.   For purposes of disqualifying potential collocations or alternative
sites for the failure to meet the applicant’s service coverage or capacity
objectives the applicant will provide (a) a description of its objective,
whether it be to address a deficiency in coverage or capacity; (b) detailed
maps or other exhibits with clear and concise Radio Frequency (“RF”) data to
illustrate that the objective is not met using the alternative (whether it be
collocation or a more preferred location); and (c) a description of why the
alternative (collocation or a more preferred location) does not meet the
objective.
36-175   Setbacks And Separation Or Buffer Requirements
   A.   All towers up to fifty (50) feet in height shall be set back on all
sides a distance equal to the underlying setback requirement in the applicable
zoning district. Towers in excess of fifty (50) feet in height shall be set
back one additional foot for each foot of tower height in excess of fifty (50)
feet, except where such setback is from property owned, controlled and/or
maintained by the City of Grand Island and the City Council finds in granting
the permit that reducing such additional setback will not cause harm to the
intended use of the public property. The height of a tower shall be measured
from the grade at the foot of the base pad to the top of any telecommunications
facilities or antennas attached thereto. Setback requirements shall be measured
from the base of the tower to the property line of the tract of land on which
it is located.
   B.   Towers exceeding one hundred (100) feet in height may not be located in
any residential zoned district and must be separated from all residential zoned
land and occupied structures other than those utilized by the tower owner, by a
minimum of two hundred (200) feet or one hundred percent (100%) of the height
of the proposed tower, whichever is greater.
   C.   Towers of one hundred (100) feet or less in height may be located in
residential zoned districts provided said tower is separated from any
residential structure, school, church, and/or occupied structures other than
those utilized by the tower owner, by a minimum of one hundred percent (100%)
of the height of the proposed tower.
   D.   Towers must meet the following minimum separation requirements from
other towers:
      1.   Monopole tower structures shall be separated from all other towers,
whether monopole, self-supporting lattice, or guyed, by a minimum of seven
hundred fifty (750) feet.

zoned properties located within a distance of 300% of the height of the tower,
any tower subject to this Article shall be equipped with lighting that
minimizes its effect on residential zoned properties.
   B.   All self-supporting lattice or guyed towers shall be enclosed within a
security fence or other structure designed to preclude unauthorized access.
Monopole towers shall be designed and constructed in a manner which will
preclude to the extent practical, unauthorized climbing of said structure.
36-177   Exterior Finish, Notice, Signs And Visual Impact
   A.   Exterior Finish . Towers shall have an exterior finish which enhances
compatibility with adjacent land uses, subject to review and approval by the
City Council as part of the application approval process.

shall require notice to surrounding property owners located within two hundred
(200) feet of the legal boundary of the real property where the tower is to be
located. An applicant or its designee shall provide this list to the City.
   C.   Signs . No tower may bear any signage or advertisement(s) other than
signage required by law or expressly permitted or required by the City.
   D.   Visual Impact . All towers are encouraged to be sited and designed to
minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling
public to the greatest extent reasonably possible, consistent with the proper
functioning of the tower.

in existence as a non-conforming structure and may be maintained or repaired
without complying with any of the requirements of this Article. Nonconforming
structures or uses may not be enlarged or the degree of nonconformance
increased without complying with this Article, including applying for and
obtaining a Tower Development Permit. Any modification or reconstruction of a
tower constructed or under construction after February 1, 1998, shall require
compliance with the requirements of this Article including applying for and
obtaining a Tower Development Permit. Said application shall describe and
specify all items which do not comply with this Article and may request,
subject to approval by the Mayor and City Council, an exemption from compliance
as a condition of the Tower Development Permit.
36-180   Inspections
   A.   The City reserves the right to conduct an inspection of towers, antenna
support structures, telecommunications facilities and antennas upon reasonable
notice to the tower owner or operator to determine compliance with this Article

standards set forth in the City Code, federal and state law or applicable
Industry standards.
   B.   If, upon inspection, the City concludes that a tower, antenna support
structure, telecommunications facilities or antennas fail to comply with codes
or standards and constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon written
notice being provided to the owner, the owner shall have sixty (60) days to
bring such into compliance with the codes and standards. Failure to bring such
into compliance within said sixty (60) days shall constitute grounds for
removal at the owner’s expense.
36-181   Maintenance
The towers, antenna support structures, telecommunications facilities and
antennas shall at all times be kept and maintained in good condition, order and
repair so that the same do not constitute a nuisance to or a danger to the life
or property of any person or the public.

If any tower shall cease to be used for a period of three hundred sixty-five
(365) days, the Building Department shall notify the tower owner that the site
will be subject to a determination by the Building Department Director that the
site has been abandoned. Upon issuance of a Notice to Show Cause by the
Building Department Director, the tower owner shall have thirty (30) days to
show by a preponderance of the evidence that the tower has been in use or under
repair during the period of apparent abandonment. In the event the tower owner
fails to show that the tower has been in use or under repair during the
relevant period, the Building Department Director shall issue a final
determination of abandonment of the site and the tower owner shall have seventy
five (75) days thereafter to dismantle and move the tower. In the event the
tower is not dismantled and removed, the tower shall be declared a public
nuisance by the Building Department Director, or his/her designee and a written
request shall be directed to the City Attorney to proceed to abate said public
nuisance pursuant to §
20-15 of the Grand Island City Code, and charge the costs thereof against the
real estate on which the tower is located or the owner of record of the said
real estate.

   A.   A certificate of completion will only be granted upon satisfactory
evidence that the tower was installed in substantial compliance with the
approved plans and photo simulations.
   B.   If it is found that the tower does not substantially comply with the
approved plans and photo simulations, the applicant shall make any and all such
changes required to bring the tower into compliance promptly.
   C.   The site and tower, including all landscaping, fencing and related
transmission equipment must be maintained at all times in a neat and clean
manner and in accordance with all approved plans.
   D.   All graffiti at a tower site must be removed at the sole expense of the
permittee after notification by the City to the owner or operator of the tower.

37-36   Grand Island PACE (GI-PACE) District; Creation
The City of Grand Island desires to create a clean energy assessment district
to enable property assessed clean energy financing for its property owners
while; to authorize the clean energy assessment district to enable third-party
lenders to accept applications and enter into financing agreements with
property owners within the boundaries of the district; and to create a clean
energy assessment district, which shall be known as the Grand Island PACE
District (“GI-PACE”), as authorized by Nebraska Revised Statute Sections 13-
3203 and 13-3204(3), which boundaries shall be the corporate boundaries of the
City of Grand Island and its extraterritorial jurisdiction.
37-37   Findings And Determinations
That the City Council of the City of Grand Island, Nebraska (the “City”),
hereby finds and determines as follows:
Pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §§13-3201 to 13-3211, inclusive, the Property
Assessment Clean Energy Act (the “Act”), energy efficiency and the use of
renewable energy are important for preserving the health and economic well-
being of Nebraska’s citizens. Using less energy decreases the cost of living
and keeps the cost of public power low by delaying the need for additional
power plants. To further these goals, it is necessary for the City to promote
energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems. Upfront costs for
energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems may prohibit or
deter many property owners from making improvements. It is necessary for the
City to implement an alternative financing method through the creation of a
clean energy assessment district.
Financing energy projects to further these goals is a valid purpose and can be
accomplished through Property Assessed Clean Energy (“PACE”) financing, which
is used to overcome the upfront costs for energy efficiency improvements and
renewable energy systems by using private capital and equity, rather than
public debt.
Pursuant to the Act and Neb. Rev. Stat. §13-3204, the City of Grand Island is
authorized to establish a clean energy assessment district so that owners of
qualifying property can access PACE financing for energy efficiency
improvements or renewable energy improvements to their properties located in
the City. The City also may enter into an agreement with one or more other
municipalities pursuant to the Interlocal Cooperation Act, Neb. Rev. Stat.
§§13-801, et seq., for the joint creation, administration, or creation and
administration of clean energy assessment districts, pursuant to Neb. Rev.
Stat. §13-3210. The City declares its intent that the provisions of this
Chapter shall be in conformity with federal and state laws. The City enacts
this Chapter pursuant to the Act, as amended.
37-38   Title And Definitions
Except the words and phrases specifically defined below or in Neb. Rev. Stat.
§13-3203, as amended, words and phrases used in this Article shall have their
customary meanings. As used in this Chapter, the following words and phrases

   The Mayor and City Council having been so authorized by the voters of the
City of Grand Island hereby establish a Good Life District Economic Development
Program as authorized by the Good Life District Economic Development Act.
   The purpose of this chapter is to effectuate and implement the voter
authorized program which will fulfil the purposes set forth in the Good Life
District Economic Development Act (“Act”), as may be amended from time to time,
within the boundaries of any approved Good Life District in the City of Grand
Island.
   The Program shall leverage the authorities contained in the Act, as may be
amended from time to time, to promote and develop the general and economic
welfare of the City of Grand Island and the State of Nebraska by providing
support for unique and transformational projects that will strengthen our
community, grow our economy, and strengthen our retail, entertainment, and
tourism industries.
   The Program recognizes the ability to use transformational development to
improve the economic well-being of our citizens and our community through job
creation, infrastructure, and other improvements that attract and retain
tourists and college graduates from around the state.
   The Program will focus on transformational and unique projects that generate
new economic activity, expand the tax base and generate additional state and
local taxes, create new economic opportunities, housing and jobs for residents,
and promote retail, entertainment, and dining attractions.
   This Program shall remain in effect until June 5, 2054, or until terminated
by the City as permitted by Neb. Rev. Stat. § 77-4412(7), whichever occurs
first.
   The City of Grand Island, by passage of this Article and establishment of
the Program, recognizes the promises made by the Nebraska Legislature in
LB1317, as codified in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 77-4429, that the State of Nebraska
has pledged that the State will not alter, impair, or limit the rights vested
in the Act until such time as any authorized bond, together with applicable
interest, are fully met and discharged and such contracts are fully performed
in accordance with the Act, and the City acts in reliance on this assurance in
so establishing the Program.

fund as such funds are received.
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Act, any bonds, contracts,
or other obligations which remain outstanding or unpaid upon expiration of the
Program on June 5, 2054, shall be deemed canceled and extinguished after all
remaining amounts held in the Fund have been depleted to pay such bonds,
contracts, or other obligations, and the City shall have no continued
liability, express or implied, with respect to such bonds, contracts, or other
obligations.
   The Fund shall remain open after termination of the Program until such time
as all bonds, contracts, and other obligations payable from such Fund are no
longer outstanding or are extinguished as provided in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 77-
4418, and such funds related to them fully accounted for, with no further City
action required, and after the completion of a final audit pursuant to Neb.

38-20   Compliance, Modifications, and Program Restrictions
   No Projects shall be eligible if the project includes a licensed racetrack
enclosure or an authorized gaming operator as such terms are defined in Neb.
Rev. Stat. § 9-1103, except for infrastructure or facilities that are publicly
owned or are used by or at the direction of the Nebraska State Fair Board, so
long as no gaming devices or games of chance are expected to be operated by an
authorized gaming operator within any such facilities;
   No Projects shall be eligible if the project received funds pursuant to the
Shovel-Ready Capital Recovery and Investment Act or the Economic Recovery Act.
   No Project shall be eligible if the project includes any portion of a public
or private university.
   Pursuant to the Act and, Chapter 38,
Article II of the Grand Island City Code shall serve as notice to the
Department of Economic Development that the City intends to fully preserve its
right to pledge any or all local sources of revenue for the payment of bonds
issued pursuant to the Good Life District Economic Development Act and that the
City believes removal of any property from the boundaries of an approved Good
Life District would not be in the best interest of the City, would be contrary
to the goals and purposes of the approved application for the Good Life
District, and would jeopardize the City’s ability to honor the voter’s
directive that transformational growth be pursued as allowed by the Act.
   Should City Council identify parcel(s) of land which are appropriate for
removal from the District it may pass a resolution determining that said
removal is in the best interest of the City by a two-thirds vote of its
Members.
   As the City of Grand Island and its citizens have relied on the local
sources of revenue needed to fund this Program, any property owner, applicant,
or other entity, other than the City of Grand Island, wishing to remove
property from the District as approved shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses incurred by the City of Grand Island including all administrative and
legal expenses, the cost of removing or modifying any infrastructure funded in
whole or in part by the Program, the cost of any necessary bond refinancing,
shall secure the consent of the City Council prior filing an amended map with
the State, and shall remain obligated to impose and collect the Good Life
District Occupation Tax, or any other source of local revenue including any
allocated tax, so long as the subject property would have been within the
approved boundaries of the District but for the modification of the District as
approved. Should any costs be so attributed, the City Council shall certify the
amount due and owed each quarter and shall cause the same to be levied as an
assessment against any real property and may pursue other legal actions as
needed to enforce this section.

costs have been met will include demonstration made by evidence submitted by
the District applicant or the City of Grand Island, or any other person who
submits satisfactory evidence to the Department of Economic Development.
   The Good Life District Applicant, or any other recipient of allocated sales
taxes or reduced sales taxes, or of any Program Funds must submit an annual
report to the State pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. § 77-4405(4) et seq. no later
than December 31 of each year that the good life district is in existence. This
report must also be submitted to the City of Grand Island. Persons or entities
who sell or transfer property subject to this reporting obligation must
transfer this reporting obligation with the property.
   The Good Life District Applicant, and all persons or entities receiving Good
Life District Funds or other financial assistance under this Program shall
certify to the City of Grand Island annually the amount they have committed for
investment within the District and the amount they have actually expended. This
sworn certification shall be due no later than October 31st of each year. This
certification shall include all evidence of Commitments or expenditures since
the later of the creation of the District or the last submitted annual report.
This report shall include all evidence reasonably available to substantiate
these amounts. Evidence may include proof of actual expenditures, executed
contracts, promissory notes, or other reliable, verifiable, or certified
evidence. Any person or entity failing to make said sworn certification or
failing to provide sufficient evidence of expenditures or commitments shall be
ineligible to receive additional Program funds and will be considered in breach
of any funding agreements. The Good Life District Applicant, any related
parties, and/or any party to which the Applicant has assigned, sold, or
transferred its rights or obligations, must provide this certification whether
or not funds are received by the Applicant or related parties.
   The City may, at the request of the Good Life District Applicant, or on its
own initiative, certify the evidence of commitments and expenditures as set
forth in Neb. Rev. Stat § 77-4406(2) and Grand Island City Code § 38-21 and
remit the same to the State. Such certification must be supported by sufficient
evidence and Council may compel the production of any evidence it reasonably
believes may be available or necessary to make said certification.
   The City shall be authorized to pass any actions necessary to impose and
enforce any Local Sources of Revenue as needed to develop and fund the Program
Fund.

exchange system in the building. The pipes form a “closed loop” and are filled
with a heat transfer fluid. The fluid is circulated through the piping from the
opening into the heat exchanger and back. The system functions in the same
manner as the open loop system except there is no pumping of well or surface
water.
Geothermal System (Open Loop). Water is pumped from a well or surface water
into a heat exchanger located in a surface building. The water drawn from the
Earth is then pumped back into the aquifer through a different well or in some
cases the same well, otherwise known as re-injection. Alternatively, the ground
water could be discharged the Earth’s surface or a surface water body, also
known as pump & dump. In the heating mode, cooler water is returned to the

40-12   Post-Construction
The purpose of this section is to provide requirements and criteria to prevent
and manage stormwater pollution and to diminish adverse impacts to health,
safety, property, and the general welfare of the citizens of the City of Grand
Island through regulating stormwater runoff from areas of development and
redevelopment to the maximum extent practicable as required by the Federal
Clean Water Act, 33.U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. (as amended to date), the Nebraska
Environmental Protection Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. § 81-1501 et seq. (as amended to
date) and the rules and regulations promulgated under such Acts. This chapter
will also promote the public welfare by guiding and regulating the design,
construction, and maintenance of areas of development and redevelopment.
Additional criteria can be found in the City of Grand Island Post-Construction
Stormwater Guidance Manual.
   A.   Post-Construction Requirement of Permanent BMPs/STFs.
      1.   Land development that meets the requirements of Section
40-11 (A)(1) must address stormwater runoff quality through the use of
permanent BMPs/STFs. Permanent BMPs/STFs shall be provided for in the drainage
plan for any subdivision plat, annexation plat, development agreement,
subdivision agreement or other local development plan.
      2.   Structural BMPs/STFs located on private property shall be owned and
operated by the owner(s) of the property on which the BMP is located; unless
the City of Grand Island agrees in writing that a person or entity other than
the owner shall own or operate such BMP/STF. As a condition of approval of the
BMP/STFs, the owner shall also agree to maintain the BMP/STF in perpetuity to
its design capacity unless or until the City of Grand Island shall relieve the
property owner of that responsibility in writing. The obligation to maintain
the BMP/STF shall be memorialized on the subdivision plat, annexation plat,
development agreement, subdivision agreement or other form acceptable to the
City of Grand Island and shall be recorded with the City of Grand Island Public
Works Department.
      3.   The preferred Structural BMPs/STFs that are acceptable in the City
of Grand Island and its 2 mile jurisdictional boundary without additional
review by the Public Works Director are: Bioswales, Rain Gardens, Permeable
Pavement, Green Roofs, Retention Ponds, and Detention Ponds (Provided the
detention Ponds include treatment areas to improve water quality; i.e. a
treatment forebay and filtration strip). If there are other stormwater
treatment measures a developer would like to use, plans for those measures will
need to be submitted to and approved in writing by the Director of Public
Works, prior to construction and development.
      4.   A Post Construction Stormwater Management Plan (PCSWMP) shall be
submitted to the planning department for transmittal to the Public Works
Director on a form or format specified by the director, as part of any
preliminary plat application required under Sec.
33-7; if not already submitted as part of a preliminary plat process. For any
significant redevelopment, a post-construction stormwater management plan shall
be submitted along with the permit application for any activity requiring a
building permit under Sec.
33-6.
(1)   For all developments that have not had a preliminary plat approved prior
to January 1, 2019, the post-construction stormwater management plan, at a
minimum, shall include Low Impact Development (LID) STFs to provide for water
quality control of the first one-half inch of runoff from the site. The
director may also require this minimum control level for replats that
significantly increase the amount of impervious area in a preliminarily platted
subdivision, which was approved prior to July 1, 2018.
(2)   For all developments with plats preliminarily approved after July 1, 2018
and for significant redevelopment projects, the post-construction stormwater
management plan, at a minimum shall include the STF or STFs selected, the STF
design, schedules and procedures for inspection and maintenance of the STFs,
and where it is reasonably practicable, include STFs for water quality control
of the first one-half inch of runoff from the site. Provisions for STFs are set
forth in the Grand Island Post-Construction Stormwater Management Guide. For
significant redevelopment projects that involve replacement of building
structures without significant disturbance of existing parking or other
pervious areas, BMPs for water quality control of the first one-half inch of
runoff from the site shall not be required. For significant redevelopment
projects involving an outlot parcel that is part of a greater existing
development, the calculation of the area requiring control of the first one-
half inch of runoff shall be based only on the impervious area of the project
site that is being added or disturbed within the out lot parcel.
   B.   Exemptions from the Post-Construction Storm Water Management Plan.
Systems designed to accommodate only one single family dwelling unit, duplex,
triplex, or quadraplex, provided the single unit is not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale, are exempt from the requirements in this Ordinance
to submit a Post-Construction Storm Water Management Plan. Additional policies
and procedures for the development and implementation requirements for BMPs/
STFs can be found in the City of Grand Island Post-Construction Stormwater
Management Guide.
   C.   Completion of Permanent BMPs/STFs. Upon completion of a project, the
City of Grand Island shall be provided a written certification stating that the
completed project is in compliance with the approved Final Drainage Plan. All
applicants are required to submit “as built” plans for any permanent BMPs once
final construction is completed and must be signed by a professional engineer
licensed in the State of Nebraska.
   D.   Ongoing Inspection and Maintenance of Permanent BMPs/STFs.
      1.   The owner of site must, unless an on-site stormwater management
facility or practice is dedicated to and accepted by the City of Grand Island,
execute an inspection and maintenance agreement, that shall be binding on all
subsequent owners of the permanent BMPs/STFs.
      2.   Permanent BMPs/STFs included in a Drainage Plan which is subject to
an inspection and maintenance agreement must undergo ongoing inspections to
document maintenance and repair needs and to ensure compliance with the
requirements of the agreement, the plan and this Ordinance.
         (1)   All BMPs/STFs must be inspected by the owner, using an approved
inspection form, (Appendix B of the Grand Island Post-Construction Guidance
Manual), for maintenance and repair requirements at a minimum, once per
quarter.
         (2)   All BMPs/STFs shall be inspected, by a qualified employee of the
City of Grand Island, twice per year to ensure owner compliance with the design
of the BMP/STF and to ensure maintenance and repair actions are adequately
monitored.
      3.   The maintenance agreement shall also provide that if, after notice
by the City to correct a violation requiring maintenance work, satisfactory
corrections are not made by the owner(s) or occupant within a reasonable period
of time (30 days maximum), and the City may perform all necessary work to place
the facility in proper working condition. The owner(s) or occupant of the
facility shall be assessed the cost of the work and any lawful penalties.
40-13   Technical Standards, Specifications, And Guidance
All BMPs/STFs designed to meet the requirements of this Ordinance shall
reference the appropriate technical standards, specifications and guidance as
follows:

activity.
   B.   Access to premises.
      1.   The City of Grand Island’s designees shall be permitted to enter and
inspect premises and facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the City.
      2.   The City’s designees shall be given access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of: inspection; sampling; examination and copying of
records that must be kept under the conditions of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit to discharge storm water; and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      3.   The City may place upon the premises such devices as deemed
necessary to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of discharges from the
premises.

at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at no expense to the
City. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure accuracy.
      5.   Any obstruction to safe and easy access to the premises to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed at the request of the City
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall not be paid
by the City.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing Grand Island City designees access
to premises is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility or premises with a
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to discharge storm water
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
City reasonable access for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this ordinance.
      7.   If a City of Grand Island designee has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, the City of Grand
Island may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.

The City of Grand Island may adopt requirements identifying Best Management
Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drainage
system, or waters of the United States of America. The owner or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at the owner or
operator’s expense, reasonable protection from discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drainage system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural Best
Management Practices. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and non-
structural Best Management Practices to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. These Best Management
Practices shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan as necessary
for compliance with requirements of any National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit.
40-16   Watercourse Protection
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, and such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
40-17   Notification Of Discharges And Spills
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility, premises, or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which result or may result in illegal discharges
or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drainage system, or
waters of the United States of America, said person shall take all necessary
steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the
event of such release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies and the City of Grand Island of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-
hazardous materials, said person shall notify the City of Grand Island in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person, by phone, or by facsimile shall be confirmed by
written notice addressed and mailed to the City of Grand Island within three
business days of the prior notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three years.
40-18   Geothermal Water Source Heat Pump Systems
Geothermal Water Source Heat Pump Systems may be installed and operated within
