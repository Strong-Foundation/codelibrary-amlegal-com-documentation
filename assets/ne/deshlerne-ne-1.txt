§ 1-101 CITY MAYOR; POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (A)   (1)   The Mayor shall preside at all meetings of the City Council. The
Mayor may vote on any matter that requires either a majority vote of the City
Council or a majority vote of all the elected members of the City Council if
the Mayor’s vote is required due to the City Council members being equally
divided or a majority of the City Council members or majority vote of all the
elected members cannot be reached due to absence, vacancy or abstention of one
or more City Council members. For purposes of such vote, the Mayor is deemed to
be a member of the City Council.
      (2)   The Mayor shall have superintendence and control of all the
officers and affairs of the city and shall take care that the ordinances of the
city and all laws governing cities of the second class are complied with.
(Neb. RS 17-110)
   (B)   The Mayor shall have the power to veto or sign any ordinance passed by
the City Council and to approve or veto any order, bylaw, resolution, award of
or vote to enter into any contract or the allowance of any claim. If the Mayor
approves the ordinance, order, bylaw, resolution, contract or claim, he or she
shall sign it, and it shall become effective. If the Mayor vetoes the
ordinance, order, bylaw, resolution, contract or any item or items of
appropriations or claims, he or she shall return it to the City Council stating
that the measure is vetoed. The Mayor may issue the veto at the meeting at
which the measure passed or within seven calendar days after the meeting. If
the Mayor issues the veto after the meeting, the Mayor shall notify the City
Clerk of the veto in writing. The Clerk shall notify the City Council in
writing of the Mayor’s veto. Any order, bylaw, resolution, award of or vote to
enter into any contract or the allowance of any claim vetoed by the Mayor may
be passed over his or her veto by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the
Council. If the Mayor neglects or refuses to sign any ordinance, order, bylaw,
resolution, award of or vote to enter into any contract or the allowance of any
claim, but fails to veto the measure within the time required by this section,
the measure shall become effective without his or her signature. The Mayor may
veto any item or items of any appropriation bill or any claims bill, and
approve the remainder thereof, and the item or items vetoed may be passed by
the Council over the veto as in other cases.
(Neb. RS 17-111)
   (C)   The Mayor shall, from time to time, communicate to the City Council
such information and recommend such measures as, in his or her opinion, may
tend to the improvement of the finances, the police, health, security,
ornament, comfort and general prosperity of the city.
(Neb. RS 17-112)
   (D)   The Mayor shall have the power, when he or she deems it necessary, to
require any officer of the city to exhibit his or her accounts or other papers
and to make reports to the Council, in writing, touching any subject or matter
pertaining to his or her office.
(Neb. RS 17-113)
   (E)   The Mayor shall have such jurisdiction as may be vested in him or her
by ordinance, over all places within five miles of the corporate limits of the
city for the enforcement of any health or quarantine ordinance and regulation
thereof and shall have jurisdiction in all matters vested in him or her by
ordinance, excepting taxation, within the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction
of the city.
(Neb. RS 17-114)
   (F)   The Mayor shall have the power to remit fines and forfeitures and to
grant reprieves and pardons for all offenses arising under the ordinances of
the city.
(Neb. RS 17-117)
   (G)   The Mayor shall hold no other elective or appointive office or
employment with the city.
   (H)   The Mayor shall sign the City Clerk’s minutes of all meetings of the
City Council, and he or she shall sign all resolutions that have been passed
and warrants for the payment of money when ordered by the Council.
   (I)   The Mayor shall have such other duties as are reposed in the Mayor by
the laws of the state or as the Council may by resolution confer upon the
Mayor.

city, in the opinion of the City Council, become insufficient, the Council may,
by resolution, fix a reasonable time within which the officer may give a new

become vacant and it shall be the duty of the Council to appoint a competent
and qualified person to fill the office.

majority of the legal votes favor the establishment of the sinking fund, the
planned improvement shall not be made, no annual tax shall be levied therefor,
and no sinking fund or sinking funds shall be established in connection
therewith, but such resolution of submission shall immediately be repealed. If
the proposition shall carry at such election in the manner prescribed in this
subsection (C), the City Council and its successors in office shall proceed to

provided in this article. Whenever investments of such sinking fund or funds
are made, as aforesaid, the nature and character of the same shall be reported
to the City Council, and the investment report shall be made a matter of record
by the City Clerk in the proceedings of the City Council. The sinking fund, or
sinking funds, accumulated under the provisions of this section, shall
constitute a special fund, or funds, for the purpose or purposes for which the
same was authorized and shall not be used for any other purpose unless
authorized by 60% of the qualified electors of the city voting at a general
election favoring such change in the use of the sinking fund or sinking funds.

failure of any such depository so designated and approved.

in its municipal budget statement, a proposed proprietary statement shall be
prepared in writing on forms provided by the State Auditor and filed with the

proprietary budget statement is available for public review with the Municipal
Clerk during normal business hours, shall be published at least five days prior
to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the governing
body’s jurisdiction or by mailing each resident within the governing body’s
jurisdiction.
      (2)   After such hearing, the proposed proprietary budget statement shall

change from the proposed proprietary statement presented at the hearing, a copy
of the adopted proprietary budget statement shall be filed with the Municipal
Clerk within 20 days after its adoption and published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the governing body’s jurisdiction or by mailing to each
resident within the governing body’s jurisdiction.
   (E)   If the actual expenditures for a proprietary function exceed the
estimated expenditures in the proprietary budget statement during its fiscal
year, the governing body shall adopt a proprietary function reconciliation
statement within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year which reflects any
difference between the adopted proprietary budget statement for the previous
fiscal year and the actual expenditures and revenue for such fiscal year. After
the adoption of a proprietary function reconciliation statement, it shall be
filed with the Municipal Clerk and published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the governing body’s jurisdiction or by mailing to each
resident within the governing body’s jurisdiction. If the difference between
the adopted proprietary budget for the previous fiscal year and the actual
expenditures and revenues for such fiscal year is greater than 10%, the
proprietary function reconciliation statement shall only be adopted following a
public hearing.
   (F)   Any income from a proprietary function which is transferred to the
General Fund of the municipality shall be shown as a source of revenue in the
municipal budget statement created pursuant to the State Budget Act.

§ 1-624 CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT; TIME DEPOSITS; CONDITIONS.
   (A)   The Municipal Treasurer may, upon resolution of the governing body
authorizing the same, purchase certificates of deposit from and make time
deposits in any bank or capital stock financial institution in the state to the
extent that such certificates of deposit or time deposits are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposits may be made in excess of the
amounts so secured by the corporation, and the amount of the excess deposit
shall be secured by a bond or by security given in the manner provided in this
section. The provisions of Neb. RS 77-2366 shall apply to deposits in capital
stock financial institutions.
   (B)   For the security of the fund so deposited, the Municipal Treasurer
shall require each depository to give bond for the safekeeping and payment of
such deposits and the accretions thereof, which bond shall run to the
municipality and be approved by the Chairperson. The bond shall be conditioned
that such a depository shall, at the end of every quarter, render to the
Treasurer a statement in duplicate, showing the several daily balances, the
amount of money of the municipality held by it during the quarter, the amount
of the accretion thereto and how credited. The bond shall also be conditioned
that the depository shall generally do and perform whatever may be required by
the provisions of this section and all regulations imposed by law or adopted by
the governing body for the receiving and holding thereof and shall faithfully
discharge the trust reposed in the depository. The bond shall be as nearly as
practicable in the form provided in Neb. RS 77-2304. No person in any way
connected with any depository as an officer or stockholder shall be accepted as
a surety on any bond given by the depository of which he or she is an officer
or stockholder. The bond shall be deposited with the Municipal Clerk.
   (C)   In lieu of the bond required by subsection (B) above, any bank or
capital stock financial institution making application to become a depository
may give security as provided in the Public Funds Deposit Security Act, being
Neb. RS 77-2386 et seq. to the Municipal Clerk. The penal sum of such bond
shall be equal to or greater than the amount of the deposit in excess of that
portion of such deposit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
   (D)   The Treasurer shall not have on deposit in any bank or capital stock
financial institution at any time more than the amount insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation plus the maximum amount of the bond given by the
bank or capital stock financial institution if the bank or capital stock
financial institution gives a surety bond, nor in any bank or capital stock
financial institution giving a personal bond, more than the amount insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation plus one-half of the amount of the
bond of such bank or capital stock financial institution, and the amount so on
deposit any time with any such bank or capital stock financial institution
shall not in either case exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation plus the paid-up capital stock and surplus of such bank
or capital stock financial institution. The Treasurer shall not be liable for
any loss sustained by reason of the failure of any such bonded depository whose
bond has been duly approved by the Chairperson as provided in subsection (B)
above or which has, in lieu of a surety bond, given security as provided in
subsection (C) above.

AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT.
   (A)   The governing body may authorize municipal officials to accept credit

any tax, levy, excise, duty, custom, toll, interest, penalty, fine, license,
fee or assessment of whatever kind or nature, whether general or special, as
provided by Neb. RS 77-1702.
   (B)   The total amount of such taxes, levies, excises, duties, customs,
tolls, interest, penalties, fines, licenses, fees or assessments of whatever

card, debit card or electronic funds transfer shall be collected by the
municipal official.
   (C)   With respect to a facility which it operates in a proprietary
capacity, the governing body may choose to accept credit cards, charge cards or
debit cards, whether presented in person or electronically, or electronic funds
transfers as a means of cash payment and may adjust the price for services to
reflect the handling and payment costs.
   (D)   The municipal official shall obtain, for each transaction,
authorization for use of any credit card, charge card or debit card used
pursuant to this section from the financial institution, vending service
company, credit card or charge card company or third-party merchant bank
providing such service.
   (E)   The governing body may choose to participate in the state contract for
such payment services. If the governing body chooses not to participate in the
state contract, it may choose types of credit cards, charge cards and debit
cards and may negotiate and contract independently or collectively as a
governmental entity with one or more financial institutions, vending service
companies, credit card, charge card or debit card companies or third-party
merchant banks for the provision of such services.
   (F)   When authorizing acceptance of credit card or charge card payments,
the governing body shall be authorized but not required to impose a surcharge
or convenience fee upon the person making a payment by credit card or charge
card so as to wholly or partially offset the amount of any discount or
administrative fees charged to the municipality, but the surcharge or
convenience fee shall not exceed the surcharge or convenience fee imposed by
the credit card or charge card companies or third-party merchant banks which
have contracted with the state or under subsection (E) above. The surcharge or
convenience fee shall be applied only when allowed by the operating rules and
regulations of the credit card or charge card involved or when authorized in
writing by the credit card or charge card company involved. When a person
elects to make a payment to the municipality by credit card or charge card and
such a surcharge or convenience fee is imposed, the payment of such surcharge
or convenience fee shall be deemed voluntary by such person and shall be in no
case refundable. If a payment is made electronically by credit card, charge
card, debit card or electronic funds transfer as part of a system for providing
or retrieving information electronically, the municipal official shall be
authorized but not required to impose an additional surcharge or convenience
fee upon the person making a payment.
   (G)   For the purpose of this section, ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER means the
movement of funds by non-paper means, usually through a payment system,
including, but not limited to, an automated clearinghouse or the Federal
Reserve’s Fedwire system.

anticipated at the time the budget for the current year was adopted;
         (b)   The budget adopted violated Neb. RS 13-518 through 13-522, such

13-522; or
         (c)   The City Council has been notified by the Auditor of Public
Accounts of a mathematical or accounting error or noncompliance with the State

day of hearing. This published notice shall set forth:
      (1)   The time and place of the hearing;
      (2)   The amount in dollars of additional or reduced money required and
for what purpose;
      (3)   A statement setting forth the nature of the unanticipated
circumstances and, if the budget requirements are to be increased, the reasons

remainder of the current year to meet the need for additional money in that
manner;
      (4)   A copy of the summary of the originally adopted budget previously
published; and
      (5)   A copy of the summary of the proposed revised budget.

protesting any application for additional money. A written record shall be kept
of all such hearings.
   (D)   Upon conclusion of the public hearing on the proposed revised budget
and approval of the proposed revised budget by the City Council, the Council
shall file with the County Clerk of the county or counties in which the City
Council is located, and with the Auditor of Public Accounts, a copy of the
revised budget, as adopted. The City Council may then issue warrants in payment
for expenditures authorized by the adopted revised budget. These warrants shall
be referred to as registered warrants and shall be repaid during the next
fiscal year from funds derived from taxes levied therefor.
   (E)   Within 30 days after the adoption of the budget under § 1-603, the
City Council may, or within 30 days after notification of an error by the
Auditor of Public Accounts, the Council shall correct an adopted budget which

with the County Clerk of the county or counties in which the City Council is
located and with the Auditor of Public Accounts. The City Council may then
issue warrants in payment for expenditures authorized by the budget.

§ 1-1001 CLOSED SESSIONS.
   (A)   (1)   Any public body may hold a closed session by the affirmative
vote of a majority of its voting members if a closed session is clearly
necessary for the protection of the public interest or for the prevention of
needless injury to the reputation of an individual and if such individual has
not requested a public meeting.
      (2)   Closed sessions may be held for, but shall not be limited to, such
reasons as:
         (a)   Strategy sessions with respect to collective bargaining, real
estate purchases, pending litigation or litigation which is imminent as
evidenced by communication of a claim or threat of litigation to or by the
public body;
         (b)   Discussion regarding deployment of security personnel or
devices;
         (c)   Investigative proceedings regarding allegations of criminal

      (3)   Nothing in this section shall permit a closed meeting for

shall be recorded in the minutes. The public body holding such a closed session
shall restrict its consideration to matters during the closed portions to only
those purposes set forth in the minutes as the reason for the closed session.

taken. For the purpose of this section, FORMAL ACTION shall mean a collective
decision or a collective commitment or promise to make a decision on any
question, motion, proposal, resolution, order or ordinance or formation of a
position or policy but shall not include negotiating guidance given by members
of the public body to legal counsel or other negotiators in closed sessions
authorized under subsection (A)(2)(a) above.
   (C)   Any member of the public body shall have the right to challenge the
continuation of a closed session if the member determines that the session has
exceeded the reason stated in the original motion to hold a closed session or
if the member contends that the closed session is neither clearly necessary for

§ 2-107 JOINT HOUSING AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Any two or more cities, villages or counties, or any combination
thereof, may, by resolution of their separate governing bodies, determine that
there is a need for a Joint Housing Authority to provide decent, safe and
sanitary housing for persons of low income living in a multi-jurisdictional
area, and that this need would be more efficiently served by the establishment
of such Joint Housing Authority. Such Joint Housing Authority shall have
perpetual existence; except that any city, village or county, as the case may
be, may withdraw from participation in the Joint Housing Authority by
resolution of its governing body only under the conditions set out in state
law. The area of operation of such Joint Housing Authority would be an area
equivalent to the total areas of operation which the housing authorities, if
created separately by the cities, villages or counties establishing the Joint
Authority would have. The creation of subsequent housing authorities shall not
affect the area of operation or territorial jurisdiction of any existing
Housing Authority. Whenever a Joint Housing Authority is created, it shall bear
such name as the political subdivision or subdivisions creating it shall
choose, and such name shall include the words Joint Housing Authority.
   (B)   (1)   When it is determined by resolution of the governing bodies of
two or more cities, villages or counties, or any combination thereof, that it
is expedient to create a Joint Housing Authority and to participate therein,
the governing bodies shall appoint persons who shall be residents of the area
of operations of the Authority and who shall constitute the Joint Housing
Authority, and such persons shall be called Commissioners.
      (2)   The Commissioners shall be appointed as follows:
         (a)   When two political subdivisions constitute the participating
members in such Joint Authority, each shall appoint two persons to act as
Commissioners, and such Commissioners shall elect a fifth person to act as a
Commissioner;
         (b)   When three political subdivisions constitute the participating
members in such Joint Authority, each shall appoint one person to act as a
Commissioner and such Commissioners shall elect a fourth and fifth person to
act as Commissioners;
         (c)   When four political subdivisions constitute the participating
members in such Joint Authority, each shall appoint one person to act as
Commissioner and such Commissioners shall elect a fifth person to act as a
Commissioner; and
         (d)   When five or more political subdivisions constitute the
participating members in the Joint Authority, each shall appoint one person to
act as Commissioner.
   (C)   Each Commissioner shall serve a term of five years from the date of
his or her appointment. All vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term by
the entity originally appointing such Commissioner. Tenancy in a project
established by a Joint Housing Authority shall not preclude the appointment of
any person to serve as a Commissioner of such Joint Housing Authority. After a
Joint Housing Authority has been created, additional political subdivisions may
elect to participate as members of such Joint Housing Authority after
compliance with Neb. RS 71-1598, if the majority of existing Commissioners in
such Joint Housing Authority and all participating political subdivisions by
their respective governing bodies consent to such additional member. A Joint
Housing Authority having 12 or more Commissioners may by resolution establish
an executive committee of at least five but not more than seven Commissioners.
The committee shall have such powers over the management and operation of such
Joint Housing Authority as the Commissioners of such Joint Housing Authority
shall specify and shall declare in the resolution. No person shall serve as a
Commissioner unless he or she resides within the area of operation of the Joint
Housing Authority involved.

§ 2-108 PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   (1)   If the City Council adopts zoning or other regulations pursuant
to Neb. RS 19-901 et seq., the Planning Commission shall consist of five, seven
or nine regular members, as specified by the City Council by ordinance, who
shall represent, insofar as is possible, the different professions or
occupations in the city and shall be appointed by the Mayor by and with the
approval of a majority vote of the members elected to the City Council. Two of
the regular members may be residents of the area over which the city is
authorized to exercise extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation. When
there are 500 residents in the area over which the city exercises
extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation, one regular member of the
Commission shall be a resident from such area. If it is determined by the City
Council that 500 residents reside in the area subject to extraterritorial
zoning or subdivision regulation, and no such resident is a regular member of
the Commission, the first available vacancy on the Commission shall be filled
by the appointment of such an individual. A number of Commissioners equal to a
majority of the number of regular members appointed to the Commission shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. All regular members of
the Commission shall serve without compensation. The term of each regular
member shall be three years, except that one-third or fewer of the regular
members of the first Commission to be so appointed shall serve for terms of one
year, one-third or fewer for terms of two years, and the remaining members for
terms of three years. All regular members shall hold office until their
successors are appointed. Any member may, after a public hearing before the
Council, be removed by the Mayor with the consent of a majority vote of the
members elected to the Council for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance
in office or other good and sufficient cause. Vacancies occurring otherwise
than through the expiration of term shall be filled for the unexpired portion
of the term by the Mayor.
      (2)   The Mayor may, with the approval of a majority vote of the elected
members of the Council, appoint one alternate member to the Planning
Commission. The alternate member shall serve without compensation. The term of
the alternate member shall be three years, and he or she shall hold office
until his or her successor is appointed and approved. The alternate member may
be removed from office in the same manner as a regular member. If the alternate
member position becomes vacant other than through the expiration of the term,
the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the Mayor
with the approval of a majority vote of the elected members of the Council. The
alternate member may attend any meeting and may serve as a voting and
participating member of the Commission at any time when less than the full
number of regular Commission members is present and capable of voting.
      (3)   A regular or alternate member of the Planning Commission may hold
any other municipal office except:
         (a)   Mayor;
         (b)   A member of the City Council;
         (c)   A member of any community redevelopment authority or limited
community redevelopment authority created under Neb. RS 18-2102.01; or
         (d)   A member of any citizen advisory review committee created under
Neb. RS 18-2715.
(Neb. RS 19-926)
   (B)   The Commission shall elect its Chairperson from its members and create
and fill such other of its offices as it may determine. The term of the
Chairperson shall be one year, and he or she shall be eligible for reelection.
The Commission shall hold at least one regular meeting in each calendar
quarter, except as provided in this section. The City Council may require the
Commission to meet more frequently and the Chairperson of the Commission may
call for a meeting when necessary to deal with business pending before the
Commission. If no business is pending before the Commission, the Chairperson
may cancel a quarterly meeting, but no more than three quarterly meetings may
be cancelled per calendar year. The Commission shall adopt rules and
regulations for the transaction of business and shall keep a record of its
resolutions, transactions, findings and determinations, which shall be a public
record.
(Neb. RS 19-927)
   (C)   No member of the Commission shall serve in the capacity of both the
Chairperson and secretary of the Commission. The secretary shall keep the full
and correct minutes and records of all meetings and file them with the City
Clerk where they shall be available for public inspection during office hours.
   (D)   The City Council may provide the funds, equipment and accommodations
necessary for the work of the Commission, but the expenditures of the
Commission, exclusive of gifts, shall be within the amounts appropriated for
that purpose by the Council; and no expenditures nor agreements for
expenditures shall be valid in excess of such amounts.
(Neb. RS 19-928)
   (E)   (1)   (a)   Except as provided in Neb. RS 19-930 through 19-933, the
Planning Commission shall:
            1.   Make and adopt plans for the physical development of the city,
including any areas outside its boundaries which in the Commission’s judgment
bear relation to the planning of such city and including a comprehensive
development plan as defined by Neb. RS 19-903;
            2.   Prepare and adopt such implemental means as a capital
improvement program, subdivision regulations, building codes and a zoning
ordinance in cooperation with other interested city departments; and
            3.   Consult with and advise public officials and agencies, public
utilities, civic organizations, educational institutions and citizens with
relation to the promulgation and implementation of the comprehensive
development plan and its implemental programs. The Commission may delegate
authority to any such group to conduct studies and make surveys for the
Commission, make preliminary reports on its findings and hold public hearings
before submitting its final reports.
         (b)   The City Council shall not take final action on matters relating
to the comprehensive development plan, capital improvements, building codes,
subdivision development, the annexation of territory or zoning until it has
received the recommendation of the Planning Commission, provided that the
Planning Commission shall make its recommendation so that it is received by the
City Council within 60 days after the Commission begins consideration of a
matter or within such other number of days as the City Council has set by
ordinance.
         (c)   A recommendation from the Planning Commission shall not be
required for subdivision of existing lots and blocks whenever all required
public improvements have been installed, no new dedication of public rights-of-
way or easements is involved, and such subdivision complies with the ordinance
requirements concerning minimum areas and dimensions of such lots and blocks,
if the City Council has designated, by ordinance, an agent pursuant to Neb. RS
19-916.
      (2)   (a)   The Commission may, with the consent of the City Council, in
its own name, make and enter into contracts with public or private bodies,
receive contributions, bequests, gifts or grant funds from public or private
sources, expend the funds appropriated to it by the city, employ agents and
employees and acquire, hold and dispose of property.
         (b)   The Commission may on its own authority make arrangements
consistent with its program, conduct or sponsor special studies or planning
work for any public body or appropriate agency, receive grants, remuneration or
reimbursement for such studies or work and, at its public hearings, summon
witnesses, administer oaths and compel the giving of testimony.
      (3)   (a)   The Commission may grant conditional uses or special
exceptions to property owners for the use of their property if the City Council
has, through a zoning ordinance or special ordinance, generally authorized the
Commission to exercise such powers and has approved the standards and
procedures adopted by the Commission for equitably and judiciously granting
such conditional uses or special exceptions. The granting of a conditional use
permit or special exception shall only allow property owners to put their
property to a special use if it is among those uses specifically identified in
the zoning ordinance as classifications of uses which may require special
conditions or requirements to be met by the owners before a use permit or
building permit is authorized.
         (b)   The power to grant conditional uses or special exceptions shall
be the exclusive authority of the Commission, except that the City Council may
choose to retain for itself the power to grant conditional uses or special
exceptions for those classifications of uses specified in the zoning ordinance.
The Council may exercise such power if it has formally adopted standards and
procedures for granting such conditional uses or special exceptions in a manner
that is equitable and will promote the public interest.
         (c)   An appeal of a decision by the Commission or Council regarding a
conditional use or special exception shall be made to the District Court.

§ 2-110 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   The Mayor shall appoint, with the consent of the City Council, a Board
of Adjustment, which shall consist of five regular members plus one additional
member designated as an alternate who shall attend and serve only when one of
the regular members is unable to attend for any reason. Each member shall be
appointed for a term of three years and shall be removable for cause by the
Mayor upon written charges and after public hearings. Vacancies shall be filled
for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant. One member only
of the Board of Adjustment shall be appointed from the membership of the
Planning Commission, and the loss of membership on the Planning Commission by
such member shall also result in his or her immediate loss of membership on the
Board of Adjustment and the appointment of another Planning Commissioner to the
Board of Adjustment. If the Board does not include a member who resides in the
extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction of the city, the first vacancy occurring
on the Board of Adjustment after the effective date of this section shall be
filled by the appointment of a person who resides in the extraterritorial
zoning jurisdiction of the city at such time as more than 200 persons reside
within such area. Thereafter, at all times, at least one member of the Board of
Adjustment shall reside outside the corporate boundaries of the city but within
its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction. Neither the Mayor nor any member of
the City Council shall serve as a member of the Board of Adjustment.
   (B)   The members of the Board shall serve without compensation and may be
required, in the discretion of the City Council, to give a bond in a sum set by
resolution of the City Council and conditioned upon the faithful performance of
their duties. The Board shall organize at its first meeting each year after the
City Council meeting when appointments are regularly made and shall elect from
its membership a Chairperson and secretary. No member of the Board of
Adjustment shall serve in the capacity of both Chairperson and secretary of the
Board.
   (C)   The Board shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of this
section and Neb. RS 19-901 through 19-914. Meetings of the Board shall be held
at the call of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may
determine. Special meetings may be also held upon the call of any three members
of the Board. A majority of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the purpose
of doing business. The Chairperson, or in his or her absence the Acting
Chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All
meetings of the Board shall be open to the public. It shall be the duty of the
secretary to keep complete and accurate minutes of the Board’s proceedings,
showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to
vote, indicating such fact, and to keep records of the Board’s examinations and
other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office
of the Board and shall be public record. The Board shall be responsible for
making such reports and performing such other duties as the Mayor and City
Council may designate.
   (D)   Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any
officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected by any decision of
the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable
time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the officer from
whom the appeal is taken and with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken
certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with
him or her, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in
his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application on notice to the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. The Board shall
fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice
thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same
within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or
by agent or by attorney.
   (E)   The Board shall have only the following powers:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative
official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation
or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures, except
that the authority to hear and decide appeals shall not apply to decisions made
by the City Council or Planning Commission regarding a conditional use or
special exception;
      (2)   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of any zoning
regulation, requests for interpretation of any map; and
      (3)   When by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a
specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning
regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property,
the strict application of any zoning regulation would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardships upon
the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an appeal relating to the
property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such
difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and
purpose of any ordinance or resolution.
   (F)   (1)   No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it
finds that:
         (a)   The strict application of the zoning regulation would produce
undue hardship;
         (b)   Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the
same zoning district and the same vicinity;
         (c)   The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be
changed by the granting of the variance; and
         (d)   The granting of such variance is based upon reason of
demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit or caprice.
      (2)   No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the
condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the
property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably
practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an
amendment to the zoning regulations.
   (G)   In exercising the powers granted in this section, the Board may, in
conformity with Neb. RS 19-901 through 19-915, reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed
from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought
to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom
the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any
such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any
matter upon which it is required to pass under any such regulation or to effect
any variation in such regulation.
   (H)   Appeals from a decision by the Board may be taken as provided in Neb.
RS 19-912.

§ 2-111 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.
   (A)   Administration. The city has adopted an Economic Development Program.
To administer the program, there are established and identified the following
components and responsibilities.
      (1)   Program Administrator. The Program Administrator shall be appointed
by the Mayor and approved by the City Council. The Program Administrator shall
be responsible for the day-to-day activities of administering the program. The
Program Administrator shall be the primary point of contact for applicants on
the program, the application process and additional financial documents needed
for the application process. The Program Administrator shall coordinate with
applicants, Citizen Advisory Review Committee, Application Review Committee and
City Council to ensure timely review of completed applications.
      (2)   Citizen Advisory Review Committee. The Citizen Advisory Review
Committee shall consist of five members appointed by the Mayor and approved by
the City Council. No member may be an elected or appointed official, employee
of the city or any person who participates in the decision-making process
regarding expenditures of program funds. At least one member on the Committee
must have expertise or experience in the field of business, finance or
accounting. The Program Administrator will serve as ex officio member. The
Citizen Advisory Review Committee shall meet regularly as required to review
the program and shall report to the City Council at least once in every six-
month period on its findings and suggestions at a public hearing called for
that purpose.
      (3)   Application Review Committee. The Application Review Committee
shall consist of three to seven members appointed by the Mayor and approved by
the City Council. Members shall have some level of economic development,
lending, business and/or accounting expertise. No member may be an elected or
appointed official, employee of the city, nor anyone who is an applicant,
employee agent, shareholder or officer of an applicant for program funds.
Members are not required to live within the city limits. The Application Review
Committee shall review and analyze program applications, including confidential
financial information, to make an educated evaluation of the viability of the
project and recommendation to the City Council. The Committee shall meet
regularly to ensure applications are processed, reviewed and brought before the
City Council in a timely manner.
      (4)   City Council. The City Council shall exercise final authority on
expenditure of funds in support of the economic development program. The City
Council shall provide ultimate responsibility and oversight for the program.
   (B)   Confidentiality. The Program Administrator and members of the
Application Review Committee, Citizen Advisory Review Committee, City Council
and city staff may receive information about businesses that is confidential
and, if released, could harm businesses or give an unfair advantage to
competitors. Information received and reviewed through the Economic Development
Program is therefore considered confidential. State law authorizes the city to
maintain the confidentiality of business information which comes into its
possession for use in the Economic Development Program. Unauthorized disclosure
of any confidential business information shall be a misdemeanor.

   The municipality owns and operates the Municipal Water Department through
the Utilities Superintendent. The governing body, for the purpose of defraying
the cost of the care, management and maintenance of the Municipal Water
Department may each year levy a tax, not exceeding the maximum limit prescribed
by state law, on the actual valuation of all real estate and personal property
within the corporate limits that is subject to taxation. The revenue from said
tax shall be known as the Water Fund and shall remain in the custody of the
Municipal Treasurer. The Utilities Superintendent shall have the direct
management and control of the Municipal Water Department and shall faithfully
carry out the duties of his or her office. The Utilities Superintendent shall
have the authority to adopt rules and regulations for the sanitary and
efficient management of the Water Department subject to the supervision and
review of the governing body. The governing body shall set the rates to be
charged for services rendered by ordinance and shall file a copy of the rates
in the office of the Municipal Clerk for public inspection at any reasonable
time.

§ 3-102 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this article, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   MAIN. Any pipe other than a supply or service pipe that is used for the
purpose of carrying water to and dispersing the same in the municipality.
   SEPARATE PREMISES. More than one consumer procuring water from the same
service or supply pipe. The second premises may be a separate dwelling,
apartment, building or structure used for a separate business.
   SERVICE PIPE. Any pipe extending from the shut-off, stop box or curb cock at
or near the lot line to and beyond the property line of the consumer to the
location on the premises where the water is to be dispersed.
   SUPPLY PIPE. Any pipe tapped into a main and extending from there to a point
at or near the lot line of the consumer’s premises where the shut-off, stop box
or curb cock is located.
§ 3-103 WATER CONTRACT.
   The municipality, through its Water Department, shall furnish water to
persons within its corporate limits whose premises abut a street or alley in
which a commercial main now is or may hereafter be laid. No water service shall
be provided to individuals, businesses or any entity whatsoever without
installation of a water flow meter, selected by the municipality, to accurately
determine water usage. The municipality may furnish water to persons within its
corporate limits whose premises do not abut a street or alley in which a
municipal commercial main is now or may hereafter be laid and may also furnish
water to persons whose premises are situated outside the corporate limits of
the municipality, as and when, according to law, the governing body may see fit
to do so. The rules, regulations and water rates hereinafter named in this
article shall be considered a part of every application hereafter made for
water service and shall be considered a part of the contract between every
consumer now or hereafter served. Without further formality, the making of
application on the part of any applicant or the use or consumption of water
service by present consumers thereof and the furnishing of water service to
said consumer shall constitute a contract between the consumer and the
municipality to which said contract both parties are bound. If the consumer
shall violate any of the provisions of said contract or any reasonable rules
and regulations that the governing body may hereafter adopt, the Utilities
Superintendent, or his or her agent, may cut off or disconnect the water
service from the building or premises or place of such violation. No further
connection for water service to said building, premises or place shall again be
made save or except by order of the Utilities Superintendent or his or her
agent.

§ 3-104 INSTALLATION PROCEDURE.
   In making excavations in streets, alleys or sidewalks for the purpose of
installing pipe or making repairs, the paving, stones and earth must be removed
and deposited in a manner that will occasion the least inconvenience to the
public and provide for adequate drainage. No person shall leave an excavation
made in the street, alley or sidewalk open at any time without a barricade, and
during the night, warning lights. After service pipes are laid, the streets,
alleys and sidewalks shall be restored to good condition. If the excavation in
any street, alley or sidewalk is left open or unfinished for a period of 24
hours or more, the Utilities Superintendent shall have the duty to finish or
correct the work, and all expenses so incurred shall be charged to the
consumer. All installations or repairs of pipes require two inspections by the
Utilities Superintendent. The first inspection shall be made when connections
or repairs are completed and before the pipes are covered. The second
inspection shall be made after the dirt work is completed and the service is
restored. It is the customer’s responsibility to notify the Superintendent at
the time the work is ready for each inspection. All installation shall be done
under the supervision and strictly in accordance with the rules, regulations
and specifications prescribed for such installation by the Utilities
Superintendent; provided, however, that in all cases service lines from the
main to the stop box must be of copper and, provided further, that said rules,
regulations and specifications have been reviewed and approved by the governing
body.

own expense shall replace and keep in repair all service pipe from the stop box
to the place of disbursement. When leaks occur in service pipes, the Utilities
Superintendent shall shut off water service until the leak is repaired at the
expense of the customer to the satisfaction of the Utilities Superintendent.
All water meters shall be kept in repair by the municipality at the expense of
the municipality. When meters are worn out, they shall be replaced and reset by
the municipality at the expense of the municipality; provided, that if the
customer permits or allows a water meter to be damaged, injured or destroyed
through his or her own recklessness, carelessness or neglect so that the meter
must be repaired or replaced, the Utilities Superintendent shall bill and
collect from the customer the cost of such meter repair or replacement in the
same manner as water rent is collected. Permitting a water meter to be damaged
or destroyed by freezing shall always be considered negligence on the part of
the customer. All meters shall be tested at the customer’s request at the
expense of the customer any reasonable number of times; provided, that if the
test shows the water meter to be running 2% or more fast, the expense of such
test shall be borne by the municipality. The municipality reserves the right to
test any water service meter at any time, and, if said meter is found to be
beyond repair, the municipality shall always have the right to place a new
meter on the customer’s water service fixtures at municipal expense. Should a
consumer’s meter fail to register properly, the customer shall be charged for
water during the time the meter is out of repair on the basis of the monthly
consumption during the same month of the preceding year; provided, that if no
such basis for comparison exists, the customer shall be charged such amount as
may be reasonably fixed by the Utilities Superintendent. It shall be unlawful
for any person to tamper with any water meter, or by any means or device to
divert water from the service pipe so that the same shall not pass through said
meter, or, while passing through said meter, to cause the same to register
inaccurately.

      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply of the city water system
from contamination or pollution by containing within the consumer’s internal
distribution system or private water system contaminants or pollutants which
could backflow through the service connection into the public potable water
supply system;
      (2)   To promote the elimination, containment, isolation or control of
existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public or
consumer’s potable water systems and nonpotable water systems, plumbing
fixtures and industrial process systems; and
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
   (B)   Application. Sections
3-118 through
3-125 shall apply to all premises served by the public potable water system of
the city.
   (C)   Policy. Sections
3-118 through

otherwise provided, the procedures in this section shall apply to abatement of
nuisances.
   (B)   Upon determination by the Board of Health or designated official that
the owner or occupant of any such real estate has failed to keep the real
estate free of nuisances, notice to abate and remove such nuisance and notice
of the right to a hearing before the City Council and the manner in which it
may be requested shall be given to each owner or owner’s duly authorized agent
and to the occupant, if any, by personal service or by certified mail. If
notice by personal service or certified mail is unsuccessful, notice shall be
given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or by
conspicuously posting the notice on the real estate upon which the nuisance is
to be abated and removed. The notice shall describe the condition as found by
the Board of Health or designated official and state that the condition has
been declared a nuisance and must be remedied at once.
   (C)   If, within five days after receipt of such notice or publication or
posting, whichever is applicable, the owner or occupant of the real estate does
not request a hearing with the city or fails to comply with the order to abate
and remove the nuisance, the city may have such work done.
   (D)   If, within five days after receipt of such notice or publication or
posting, whichever is applicable, the owner or occupant requests in writing a
hearing with the City Council, the Council shall fix a time and place at which
a hearing will be held. Notice of the hearing shall be given by personal
service or certified mail and require the owner or occupant to appear before
the Council to show cause why such condition should not be found to be a
nuisance and remedied. The notice shall be given not less than seven nor more
than 14 days before the time of the hearing. Upon the date fixed for the
hearing and pursuant to the notice, the Council shall hear all objections made
by the owner or occupant and shall hear evidence submitted by the Board of
Health or designated official. If, after consideration of all the evidence, the
City Council finds that the condition is a nuisance, it shall by resolution
order and direct the owner or occupant to remedy the nuisance at once. If the
owner or occupant refuses or neglects to promptly comply with the order to
abate and remove the nuisance, the Council may have such work done.
   (E)   The costs and expenses of any such work shall be paid by the owner. If
unpaid for two months after such work is done, the city may either:
      (1)   Levy and assess the costs and expenses of the work upon the real
estate so benefitted as a special assessment in the same manner as other
special assessments for improvements are levied and assessed; or
      (2)   Recover in a civil action the costs and expenses of the work upon
the real estate and the adjoining streets and alleys.

not request a hearing with the city within five days after receipt of such
notice or fails to comply with the order to abate and remove the nuisance, the
city may have such work done. The city may levy and assess all or any portion
of the costs and expenses of the work upon the lot or piece of ground so
benefitted as a special assessment.

amended from time to time, closer to a municipal water well than the
limitations set forth in §
4-603.
      (2)   Closer placement shall be allowed only under the following
conditions: An application must first be filed with the city showing the type
of water well to be installed, the materials used, the operation of the

water well. Preference, for approval, will be given to installations that do
not disturb any bearing strata.
   (B)   (1)   The city shall refer the application to its engineer for
evaluation and report. The estimated cost of the engineer’s fees must be paid

reasonably incurred by the engineer in making his or her examination and report
shall be paid by the applicant, in addition to any previously paid estimated
costs.
      (2)   The governing body shall consider the engineer’s report and any
additional information submitted by the applicant. In reaching its decision on
whether to allow the placement of a water well, as above defined, the governing
body must act to prevent all sources of possible or likely water contamination.
   (C)   If the governing body approves the installation, it shall submit the
application, together with the engineer’s report to the State Department of
Health for final approval or denial.
   (D)   No installation shall be made without the approval of both the
governing body and the State Department of Health.
§ 4-605 EXISTING WELLS.

presents a hazard to the quality or quantity of the drinking water for public
use. The owner of any water well shall have the burden of establishing the
existence and use of such well at the time of effective date of this article.
§ 4-606 VIOLATION; PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person found violating any provision of this article shall be
subject to a fine, not to exceed $100. The continuation of a violation of this
article shall be deemed an additional offense for every 24 hours of such
continued violation.

§ 8-103 SALE AND CONVEYANCE OF REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in subsection (G) below, the power of the city to
convey any real property owned by it, including land used for park purposes and
public squares, except real property used in the operation of public utilities,
shall be exercised by resolution, directing the sale at public auction or by
sealed bid of such property and the manner and terms thereof, except that such
property shall not be sold at public auction or by sealed bid when:
      (1)   Such property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of
federal or state grants or programs;
      (2)   Such property is being conveyed to another public agency; or
      (3)   Such property consists of streets and alleys.
   (B)   The City Council may establish a minimum price for real property at
which bidding shall begin or shall serve as a minimum for a sealed bid.
   (C)   After the passage of the resolution directing the sale, notice of all
proposed sales of property described in subsection (A) above and the terms
thereof shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks in a
legal newspaper published in or of general circulation in the city.
   (D)   (1)   If within 30 days after the third publication of the notice a
remonstrance against such sale is signed by registered voters of the city equal
in number to 30% of the registered voters of the city voting at the last
regular municipal election held therein and is filed with the City Council,
such property shall not then, nor within one year thereafter, be sold. If the
date for filing the remonstrance falls upon a Saturday, Sunday or legal
holiday, the signatures shall be collected within the 30-day period, but the
filing shall be considered timely if filed or postmarked on or before the next
business day.
      (2)   Upon the receipt of the remonstrance, the City Council, with the
aid and assistance of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk, shall
determine the validity and sufficiency of signatures on the remonstrance. The
City Council shall deliver the remonstrance to the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials or by
certified mail, return receipt requested.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the remonstrance, the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk shall issue to the City Council a written receipt that the
remonstrance is in the custody of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk.
The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall compare the signature of each
person signing the remonstrance with the voter registration records to
determine if each signer was a registered voter on or before the date on which
the remonstrance was filed with the City Council. The Election Commissioner or
County Clerk shall also compare the signer’s printed name, street and number or
voting precinct and city or post office address with the voter registration
records to determine whether the signer was a registered voter. The signature
and address shall be presumed to be valid only if the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk determines that the printed name, street and number or voting
precinct and city or post office address matches the registration records and
that the registration was received on or before the date on which the
remonstrance was filed with the City Council. The determinations of the
Election Commissioner or County Clerk may be rebutted by any credible evidence
which the City Council finds sufficient. The express purpose of the comparison
of names and addresses with the voter registration records, in addition to
helping to determine the validity of the remonstrance, the sufficiency of the
remonstrance and the qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent fraud,
deception and misrepresentation in the remonstrance process.
      (4)   Upon completion of the comparison of names and addresses with the
voter registration records, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
prepare in writing a certification under seal setting forth the name and
address of each signer found not to be a registered voter and the signature
page number and line number where the name is found, and if the reason for the
invalidity of the signature or address is other than the non-registration of
the signer, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall set forth the
reason for the invalidity of the signature. If the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk determines that a signer has affixed his or her signature more
than once to the remonstrance and that only one person is registered by that
name, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in writing a
certification under seal setting forth the name of the duplicate signature and
shall count only the earliest dated signature.
      (5)   The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall certify to the City
Council the number of valid signatures necessary to constitute a valid
remonstrance. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall deliver the
remonstrance and the certifications to the City Council within 40 days after
the receipt of the remonstrance from the City Council. The delivery shall be by
hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials or by certified mail, return
receipt requested. Not more than 20 signatures on one signature page shall be
counted.
      (6)   The City Council shall, within 30 days after the receipt of the
remonstrance and certifications from the Election Commissioner or County Clerk,
hold a public hearing to review the remonstrance and certifications and receive
testimony regarding them. The City Council shall, following the hearing, vote
on whether or not the remonstrance is valid and shall uphold the remonstrance
if sufficient valid signatures have been received.
   (E)   Real estate now owned or hereafter owned by the city may be conveyed
without consideration to the state for state armory sites or, if acquired for
state armory sites, shall be conveyed strictly in accordance with the
conditions of Neb. RS 18-1001 through 18-1006.
   (F)   Following passage of the resolution directing a sale, publishing of
the notice of the proposed sale and passing of the 30-day right-of-remonstrance
period, the property shall then be sold. Such sale shall be confirmed by
passage of an ordinance stating the name of the purchaser and terms of the
sale.
   (G)   Subsections (A) through (F) above shall not apply to the sale of real
property if the authorizing resolution directs the sale of real property, the
total fair market value of which is less than $5,000. Following passage of the
resolution directing the sale of the property, notice of the sale shall be
posted in three prominent places within the city for a period of not less than
seven days prior to the sale of the property. The notice shall give a general
description of the property offered for sale and state the terms and conditions
of sale. Confirmation of the sale by passage of an ordinance may be required.

thereof. Following passage of the resolution directing the sale of the
property, notice of the sale shall be posted in three prominent places within
the city for a period of not less than seven days prior to the sale of the
property. If the fair market value of the property is greater than $5,000,
notice of the sale shall also be published once in a legal newspaper published
in or of general circulation in the city at least seven days prior to the sale
of the property. The notice shall give a general description of the property
offered for sale and state the terms and conditions of sale.
   (B)   Personal property may be conveyed notwithstanding the procedure in
subsection (A) above when:
      (1)   Such property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of
federal or state grants or programs; or
      (2)   Such property is being conveyed to another public agency.

   (B)   If the abutting property owner refuses or neglects, after five days’
notice by publication or, in place thereof, personal service of such notice, to
remove all encroachments from sidewalks, as provided in subsection (A), the
city through the proper officers may cause such encroachments to be removed,
and the cost of removal shall be paid out of the street fund. The City Council
shall assess the cost of the notice and removal of the encroachment against the
abutting property as a special assessment. The special assessment shall be
known as a special sidewalk assessment and, together with the cost of notice,
shall be levied and collected as a special assessment in addition to the
general revenue taxes and shall be subject to the same penalties as other
special assessments and shall draw interest from the date of the assessment.

fund.

   (A)   For the purpose of this section, SPECIAL DAMAGES shall mean only those
losses or damages or injuries which a property owner suffers that are peculiar
or special or unique to his or her property and which result from the City
Council vacating a street, avenue, alley, lane or similar public way. SPECIAL
DAMAGES shall not mean those losses or damages or injuries that a property
owner suffers that are in common with the rest of the city or public at large,
even though those losses or damages or injuries suffered by the property owner
are greater in degree than the rest of the city or public at large.
   (B)   Whenever the City Council decides that it would be in the best
interests of the city to vacate a street, avenue, alley, lane or similar public
way, the City Council shall comply with the following procedure.
      (1)   Notice. Notice shall be given to all abutting property owners
either by first-class mail to their last known address or if there is no known
address then by publishing the notice in a newspaper that is of general
circulation in the city. The content of the notice shall advise the abutting
property owners that the City Council will consider vacating such street,
avenue, alley, lane or similar public way at its next regular meeting or, if a
special meeting is scheduled for such discussion, then the date, time and place

property owners sign a form stating that they consent to the action being taken
by the City Council and waive their right of access. The signing of such form
shall have no effect on claims for special damages by the abutting property
owners but shall create the presumption that the City Council’s action was
proper. If the abutting property owners do not sign the consent/waiver form,
the City Council may still proceed with vacating the street, avenue, alley,
lane or similar public way under the authority granted by Neb. RS 17-558 and
17-559.
      (3)   Ordinance. The City Council shall pass an ordinance that includes

all utilities; and

years continuously prior to making of application for license;
      (2)   To hotels offering restaurant service, to regularly organized clubs

not the principal business carried on, if such place of business so exempted

      (3)   To a college or university in the state which is subject to Neb. RS
53-177.01.
   (B)   If a proposed location for the sale at retail of any alcoholic liquor
or for a bottle club is within 150 feet of any church, a license may be issued

(Neb. RS 53-177)
   (C)   No alcoholic liquor shall be sold for consumption on the premises

contracting with an individual or corporation holding a license to sell
alcoholic liquor at retail for the purpose of selling alcoholic liquor at
retail on the campus of such college or university at events sanctioned by such
college or university but does prohibit the sale of alcoholic liquor at retail
by such licensee on the campus of such nonpublic college or university at
student activities or events; and
      (2)   Does not prohibit sales of alcoholic liquor by a community college
culinary education program pursuant to Neb. RS 53-124.15.

the premises on the academic mission of the college or university;
      (2)   The impact on students and prospective students if such sales were
permitted on or near campus;
      (3)   The impact on economic development opportunities located within or
in proximity to the campus; and

special designated licenses requested by the college or university or its
designee.

written application to the Commission. The Commission shall notify the
governing body of the affected college or university when the Commission

      (1)   The address of the location for which the waiver is requested;
      (2)   The name and type of business for which the waiver is requested;

(C) above without written approval from the governing body of the college or
university or its designee if the physical location of the property which is
the subject of the requested waiver is:
      (1)   Surrounded by property owned by the college or university including
any public or private easement, street or right-of-way adjacent to the property
owned by the college or university; or
      (2)   Adjacent to property on two or more sides owned by the college or
university, including any public or private easement, street or right-of-way
adjacent to the property owned by the college or university.

spouse is ineligible under this section to receive and hold a liquor license.
Such an applicant shall become eligible for a liquor license only if the State

areas of the city are subject to inundation that results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
      (2)   General causes of the flood losses. These flood losses are caused
by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in
flood heights and velocities as well as the occupancy of flood hazard areas by
uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others that are inadequately elevated
or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses
described in subsection (B) above by applying the provisions of this article
to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or
velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
that service such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of
initial construction;
      (3)   Reduce financial burdens from flood damage borne by the community,
its governmental units, is residents and its businesses by preventing excessive
and unsafe development in areas subject to flooding; and
      (4)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   (D)   Adherence to regulations. The regulations of this article are in
compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations as published
in 44 C.F.R. and the State Minimum Standards for Floodplain Management Programs
as published in the 455 NAC, Chapter 1.

§ 11-315 VARIANCE AND APPEALS PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The City Planning and Zoning Committee, as established by the city,
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements
of this article.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Committee shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this article.
      (3)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Planning and Zoning
Committee, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the District Court as
provided in Neb. RS 19-2202 through 19-2204.
      (4)   In evaluating such appeals and requests, the Planning and Zoning
Committee shall consider technical evaluation, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this article, and:
         (a)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (b)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner, future
owners and neighboring properties;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The necessity of the facility to have a waterfront location,
where applicable;
         (f)   The availability of alternative locations that are not subject
to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and the floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing government services during and after
flood conditions including emergency management services and maintenance and
repair of public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical,
water systems, streets and bridges.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause and also upon a determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued based upon a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued based upon a determination that the
granting of a variance will not result in additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (4)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures,
constructed below the base flood level, providing the provisions in subsections
(B)(5) through (B)(8) below have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      (5)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
historic structure on the National Register of Historic Places and the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (6)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (7)   The applicant shall be given a written notice over the signature of
a community that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and also that such
construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required by this article.
      (8)   All requests for variances and associated actions and documents,
including justification for their issuance, shall be maintained by the
community.

Department shall notify the Floodplain Administrator in writing of instances of
nonconforming uses where utility services have been discontinued for a period
of 24 months.
      (2)   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   (B)   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred except that if it
is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this article. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code or regulations or the cost of
any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic
Places; provided, that the alteration shall not preclude its continued
designation.
(Ord. 964, passed 6-7-2022)
§ 11-317 ENFORCEMENT.

failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
provisions of this article shall constitute a violation. A structure or other
development without a floodplain development permit, elevation certificate,
certification by a licensed professional engineer of compliance with these
regulations or other evidence of compliance is presumed to be in violation
until such time as documentation is provided.
   (B)   Notices. When the Floodplain Administrator or other authorized
community representative determines, based on reasonable grounds, that there
has been a violation of the provisions of this article, the Floodplain
Administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter

      (1)   Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply
with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with grants of variances or special exceptions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person, firm, corporation or other entity that
violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $500 and, in addition, shall
pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense.
      (2)   The imposition of such fines or penalties for any violation or
noncompliance with this article shall not excuse the violation or non-
compliance or allow it to continue. All such violations or noncompliant actions
shall be remedied within an established and reasonable time.

   (B)   The legislature found and declared in the Small Wireless Facilities
Deployment Act, being Neb. RS 86-1201 et seq. that:
      (1)   The deployment of small wireless facilities and other next-
generation wireless facilities is a matter of statewide concern and interest
and public policy;
      (2)   Wireless products and services are a significant and continually
growing part of the state’s economy and that encouraging the development of
strong and robust wireless communications networks throughout the state is
necessary to address public need and policy and is integral to the state’s
economic competitiveness;
      (3)   Rapid deployment of small wireless facilities will serve numerous
important statewide goals and public policy, including meeting growing consumer
demand for wireless data, increasing competitive options for communications
services available to the state’s residents, improving the ability of the
state’s residents to communicate with other residents and with their state and
local governments and promoting public safety;
      (4)   Small wireless facilities, including facilities commonly referred
to as small cells and distributed antenna systems, are deployed most
effectively in public rights-of-way;
      (5)   To meet the public need and policy and the key objectives of the
Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act that wireless providers must have
access to the public rights-of-way to densify their networks and provide next-
generation wireless services;
      (6)   Uniform procedures, rates and fees for permit issuance and
deployment of small wireless facilities in public rights-of-way and on
authority infrastructure, including poles, throughout the state that are
reasonable and will encourage the development of robust next-generation
wireless networks for the benefit of residents throughout the state; and
      (7)   The procedures, rates and fees in the Small Wireless Facilities
Deployment Act, together with any taxes, fees or charges imposed under Neb. RS
86-704, are fair and reasonable when viewed from the perspective of the state’s
residents and the state’s interest in having robust, reliable and
technologically advanced wireless networks and reflect a balancing of the
interests of the wireless providers deploying new facilities and the interests
of authorities in receiving fair value by recovering their costs of managing
access to the public rights-of-way and provide for the attachment space on
authority infrastructure and enable the reviewing and processing of
applications for the installation of small wireless facilities within the
rights-of-way.
