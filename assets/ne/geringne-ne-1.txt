cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
of Adjustment or by a court of record on application on notice to the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. The Board of Adjustment
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice
thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same
within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or
by agent or by attorney.
(Neb. RS 19-909)
   (F)   (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall, subject to such appropriate
conditions and safeguards as may be established by the City Council, have only
the following powers:
         (a)   To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is error in
any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation
or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures, except
that the authority to hear and decide appeals shall not apply to decisions made
by the City Council or Planning Commission regarding a conditional use or
special exception under Neb. RS 19-929(3);
         (b)   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of any
zoning regulation, requests for interpretation of any map; and
         (c)   When by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape
of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning
regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property,
the strict application of any enacted regulation under Neb. RS 19-901 and 19-
903 to 19-904.01 and division (C) above and this division (F) would result in
peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue
hardships upon the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an appeal
relating to the property, a variance from such strict application so as to
relieve such difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing
the intent and purpose of any ordinance or resolution.
      (2)   (a)   No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it
finds that:
            1.   The strict application of the zoning regulation would produce
undue hardship;
            2.   Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in
the same zoning district and the same vicinity;
            3.   The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be
changed by the granting of the variance; and
            4.   The granting of such variance is based upon reason of
demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit, or caprice.
         (b)   No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the
condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the
property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably
practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an
amendment to the zoning regulations.
      (3)   In exercising the powers granted in this division (F), the Board
may, in conformity with Neb. RS 19-901 to 19-915, reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination
as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer
from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of the Board
shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of any such administrative official or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such
regulation or to effect any variation in such regulation.
(Neb. RS 19-910)
   (G)   Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision
of the Board of Adjustment, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board,
or bureau of the city, may present to the district court a petition duly
verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and
specifying the grounds of such illegality. Such petition must be presented to
the court within 15 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the
Board. Upon the filing of such petition a summons shall be issued and be served
upon the Board of Adjustment, together with a copy of the petition. Return of
service shall be made within four days after the issuance of the summons.
Within ten days after the return day of such summons, the Board of Adjustment
shall file an answer to the petition which shall admit or deny the substantial
averments of the petition and shall state the contentions of the Board with
reference to the matters in dispute as disclosed by the petition. The answer
shall be verified in like manner as required for the petition. At the
expiration of the time for filing answer, the court shall proceed to hear and
determine the cause without delay and shall render judgment thereon according
to the forms of law. If, upon the hearing, it appears to the court that
testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take
evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report
the same to the court with his or her findings of fact and conclusions of law,
which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination
of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly,
or may modify the decision brought up for review. The appeal to the district
court shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court
may, on application, on notice to the Board and on due cause shown, grant a
restraining order. Any appeal from such judgment of the district court shall be
prosecuted in accordance with the general laws of the state regulating appeals
in actions at law.

probable amount of money necessary for all purposes to be raised by taxation in

shall pass, approve, record, and publish an ordinance, to be termed, “The
Annual Appropriation Bill,” in which such corporate authorities may appropriate
such sums of money as may be deemed necessary to defray all necessary expenses
and liabilities of the city, not exceeding in the aggregate the amount of tax
authorized to be levied during that year. In such ordinance, the Mayor and
Council shall specify the objects and purposes for which such appropriations
are made, and the amount appropriated for each object or purpose. No further
appropriation shall be made at any other time within such fiscal year, unless
the proposition to make such appropriation has been first sanctioned by a

fiscal year or biennial period, it becomes apparent to the City Council that
there are circumstances which could not reasonably have been anticipated at the
time the budget for the current year or biennial period was adopted; the budget
adopted violated Neb. RS 13-518 to 13-522, that the revenue of the current
fiscal year or biennial period for any fund thereof will be insufficient,
additional expenses will be necessarily incurred, or there is a need to reduce
the budget requirements to comply with Neb. RS 13-518 to 13-522; or the City
Council has been notified by the auditor of a mathematical or accounting error
or noncompliance with the Nebraska Budget Act, being Neb. RS 13-501, the City
Council may propose to revise the previously adopted budget statement and shall
conduct a public hearing on such proposal.
      (2)   Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published at
least four calendar days prior to the date set for hearing in a newspaper of
general circulation within the city. For purposes of such notice, the four
calendar days shall include the day of publication but not the day of hearing.
The published notice shall set forth the time and place of the hearing, the
amount in dollars of additional or reduced money required and for what purpose,
a statement setting forth the nature of the unanticipated circumstances, and,
if the budget requirements are to be increased, the reasons why the previously
adopted budget of expenditures cannot be reduced during the remainder of the
current year or biennial period to meet the need for additional money in that
manner, a copy of the summary of the originally adopted budget previously
published, and a copy of the summary of the proposed revised budget.
      (3)   At such hearing, any taxpayer may appear or file a written
statement protesting any application for additional money. A written record
shall be kept of all such hearings.
      (4)    Upon conclusion of the public hearing on the proposed revised
budget and approval of the proposed revised budget by the City Council, the
City Council shall file with the Clerk and with the Auditor, a copy of the
revised budget, as adopted. The City Council may then issue warrants in payment
for expenditures authorized by the adopted revised budget. Such warrants shall
be referred to as registered warrants and shall be repaid during the next
fiscal year or biennial period from funds derived from taxes levied therefor.
      (5)   Within 30 calendar days after the adoption of the budget under Neb.
RS 13-506, the City Council may, or within 30 calendar days after notification
of an error by the auditor, the City Council shall, correct an adopted budget
which contains a clerical, mathematical, or accounting error which does not
affect the total amount budgeted by more than 1% or increase the amount
required from property taxes. No public hearing shall be required for such a
correction. After correction, the City Council shall file a copy of the
corrected budget with the Clerk and with the Auditor. The City Council may then
issue warrants in payment for expenditures authorized by the budget.

§ 35.23 REAPPROPRIATION OF UNEXPENDED BALANCES.
   (A)   At the time of making the annual appropriation bill, the Mayor and
Council may, if notice shall have been given in the annual estimate or yearly
budget, reappropriate any unexpended balance in any fund mentioned in §
35.01 for the use of some other fund if there be no outstanding bonds,
warrants, or claims against such fund whose unexpended balance or portion
thereof is sought to be reappropriated.
   (B)   No sinking funds or interest funds on outstanding bonds or moneys in
any fund required to meet depreciation, replacements or betterments reasonably
contemplated shall ever be reappropriated. In the event that no reappropriation
of funds is authorized, unexpended balances shall be carried forward and placed
to the credit of the funds to which they belong when the books of the Treasurer
are opened at the commencement of each fiscal year on October 1.
(Prior Code, § 35.23)
§ 35.24 EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES.
   (A)   Neither the Mayor and Council nor any department of the city shall add
to the corporate expenditures in any one year anything over and above the
amount provided for in the annual appropriation bill for that year except, as
herein otherwise specifically provided. No expenditures for any improvement, to
be paid out of the General Fund of the city shall exceed in any one year, the
amount provided for such an improvement in the annual appropriation bill;
provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall prevent the Council from
ordering, by a two-thirds’ vote, the repair or restoration of any improvement,
the necessity for which is caused by any casualty or accident happening after
such annual appropriation is made.
   (B)   The Council may, by a two-thirds’ vote of the members, order the Mayor
and the Audit Committee to borrow a sufficient sum to provide for the expense
necessary to be incurred in making any repairs or restorations of improvements,
the necessity of which has arisen, as mentioned in this section, for a space of
time not exceeding the close of the next fiscal year, which sum, and the
interest, shall be added to the amount authorized to be raised in the next
general tax levy, and embraced therein.
(Prior Code, § 35.24)
TAXES
§ 35.35 CERTIFICATION OF TAX LEVY.
   The Mayor and Council shall annually, on or before October 1, certify to the
County Clerk, the several amounts which are shown by the assessment roll for
the year, including all amounts due upon legal and valid bonds outstanding
against such corporation. The certificate shall contain the percentage or
number of mills on the dollars of tax levied for all city purposes on the
taxable property within the corporation for the year ensuing, as shown by the
assessment roll for the year, including all special assessments and other taxes
authorized by law. The amount of other taxes which may be certified, assessed,
and collected shall not exceed five mills on the dollar to defray the general
and incidental expenses thereof, together with any special assessments or
special taxes, or amounts which may be assessed as taxes according to law, and
such sum as may be authorized by law for the payment of outstanding bonds and

including water mains and their appurtenances, water distribution facilities,
including, but not limited to, mains and their appurtenances.
   (C)   The City and the Community Redevelopment Authority of the city have
entered into an interlocal agreement which created a separate administrative
entity (the city’s Community Infrastructure Cooperative) for purposes of the
interlocal agreement, related to public infrastructure projects. The interlocal
agreement contains provisions, including benchmarks, relating to the long-term
development of unified governance of public infrastructure projects with
respect to the parties.
   (D)   The increased sales and use tax shall terminate no more than ten years
after the effective date of the increased sales and use tax or, if bonds are
issued and the local option sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of
such bonds, upon payment of such bonds and any refunding bonds, whichever date
is later, except that the portion of the rate greater than 1.5% imposed for the
purpose of the interlocal agreement referred to above (rounded to the next
higher 0.25%) shall not terminate.

§ 50.03 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE; NOTICE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   The municipality shall have the right to discontinue water and
electrical services and remove its properties if the charges for such services
are not paid within two weeks (including Saturday and Sunday) after the date
that the charges become delinquent. Before any termination, the municipality
shall first give notice by first-class mail, electronic mail, or in person to
any domestic subscriber whose service is proposed to be terminated. If notice
is given by first-class mail, such mail shall be conspicuously marked as to its
importance.
   (B)   The notice shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The reason for the proposed disconnection;
      (2)   A statement of the intention to disconnect unless the domestic
subscriber either pays the bill or reaches an agreement with the municipality
regarding payment of the bill;
      (3)   The date upon which service will be disconnected if the domestic
subscriber does not take appropriate action;

prevented upon presentation of a duly licensed physician’s, physicians
assistant’s, or advanced practice registered nurse’s certificate which shall
certify that the domestic subscriber or a resident within such subscriber’s
household has an existing illness or handicap which would cause such subscriber
or resident to suffer an immediate and serious health hazard by the
disconnection of the municipality’s service to that household. Such certificate
shall be filed with the municipality within five days of receiving notice under
this section, excluding holidays and weekends, and will prevent the
disconnection of the municipality’s service for a period of at least 30 days
from such filing. Only one postponement of disconnection shall be required
under this subsection for each incidence of non-payment of any past-due
account;
      (8)   The cost that will be borne by the domestic subscriber for
restoration of service;
      (9)   A statement that the domestic subscriber may arrange with the
municipality for an installment payment plan;
      (10)   A statement to the effect that those domestic subscribers who are
welfare recipients may qualify for assistance in payment of their utility bill
and that they should contact their caseworker in that regard; and   
      (11)   Any additional information not inconsistent with this section
which has received prior approval from the City Council.
   (C)   The city shall make the service termination information required under
this chapter readily accessible to the public on the website of the city and
available by mail upon request.
   (D)   A domestic subscriber may dispute the proposed discontinuance of
service by notifying the municipality with a written statement that sets forth
the reasons for the dispute and the relief requested. If a statement has been
made by the subscriber, a conference shall be held before the municipality may
discontinue services.
   (E)   The procedures adopted by the City Council for resolving utility
bills, three copies of which are on file in the office of the Clerk, are hereby
incorporated by reference in addition to any amendments thereto and are made a
part of this section as though set out in full.
   (F)   This section shall not apply to any disconnections or interruptions of
services made necessary by the municipality for reasons of repair or
maintenance or to protect the health or safety of the domestic subscriber or of
the general public.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 CONTRACT.
   The rules and regulations and water rates hereinafter named shall be
considered a part of the contract with every person who is supplied with water
through the waterworks of the city, and every such person, by taking water
shall be considered and held to be bound thereby; and whenever any of the rules
of this chapter, or such other rules as the city or its Public Works Director
may hereafter adopt, are violated, the water shall be cutoff from the building
or place of such violation, even though two or more parties may receive water
through the same pipe, and shall not be let on again except by order of the
Public Works Director, and on payment of the expense of shutting it off and
turning it on again; and after the cause for such suspension has been removed,
and upon such other terms as the Public Works Director shall determine, and a
satisfactory understanding with the parties that no further cause of complaint
shall arise. In case of such violation, the city shall have the right to
declare payment made for the water by the person committing such violation to
be forfeited, and the same shall thereupon be forfeited.
(Prior Code, § 51.001)
§ 51.002 APPLICATION.
   Every person desiring a supply of water must make application therefor to
the water office upon blanks to be supplied by the city for that purpose. The
application must state truly and fully for what purpose and all uses to which
the water is to be applied and no different or additional use will be allowed
except by permission of the Public Works Director. Not more than one house
shall be supplied from one tap except by special permission.
(Prior Code, § 51.002)
§ 51.003 WATER; WHEN TURNED ON.
   Water will not be turned on in any house or private service pipe except upon
the order of the Public Works Director or his or her duly authorized agent, nor
until the applicant shall have paid the water rent, if any, due for the current
term. Plumbers are strictly prohibited from turning the water into any service
pipe, except on the order or permission of the Public Works Director or his or
her duly authorized agent. This rule shall not be construed to prevent any
plumber admitting water to test pipes, and for that purpose only.
(Prior Code, § 51.003)
§ 51.004 WATER NOT TO BE SUPPLIED TO OTHERS BY CONSUMER.
   No consumer shall supply water to other families or suffer them to take or
in any manner use the same off his or her premises. After water has been
introduced into any building or upon any premises, no person shall make or
employ any plumber or other person to make any tap or connection with the pipe
upon the premises for alteration, extension, or attachment, without the
permission of the Public Works Director. It is hereby declared unlawful for any
person not a consumer of the water system of the city habitually to take or
draw water for domestic use from taps or facilities not his or her own.
(Prior Code, § 51.004) Penalty, see §
51.999 
§ 51.005 FIRES; WATER USE DURING.
   All persons using water shall keep the hydrant, hose, water closets,

during fire, and shall be responsible for any damage or injury that may result
to others from the improper use of the water.
(Prior Code, § 51.005)
§ 51.006 BOILERS; CITY NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.
   (A)   All house boilers shall be constructed with one or more air holes near
the top of the inlet pipe and sufficiently strong to bear the pressure of the
atmosphere under vacuum. The stop cocks and other appurtenances must be
sufficiently strong to bear the pressure and run off the water in the mains.
All persons taking water shall keep their own service pipes, stop cocks, and
apparatus in good repair and protect them from frost at their own expense, and
shall prevent all unnecessary waste of water.
   (B)   It is stipulated by the city and Public Works Director that no claim
shall be made against them, by reason of the breaking of any service cock, or
if from any cause the supply of water fails, or from damage arising from
shutting off water to repair mains, making connections, extensions, or from any
other purpose that may be deemed necessary, and the right is hereby reserved to
cut off the supply of water at any time, any permit granted to the contrary
notwithstanding.
(Prior Code, § 51.006)
§ 51.007 TURNING WATER ON AFTER SHUT OFF.
   (A)   When the water has been turned off from any consumer, he or she shall
not turn it on, or permit it to be turned on, without the written consent of
the Public Works Director or his or her authorized agent.
   (B)   Whenever any water shall have been shut off by reason of the non-
payment of water rent, or from any other violation of this chapter, the same
shall not be turned on again until payment has been made of all rent due, or
until the removal of the cause for which the water was shut off, and the
further payment to the city as a fee for turning the water on again as adopted
by the City Council and on file with the Clerk.
(Prior Code, § 51.007)
§ 51.008 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   Everyone using the water system of the city shall permit the Public Works
Director or his or her duly authorized agent, at all hours of the day between
7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. to enter his or her premises or buildings to examine
the pipes and fixtures, and the manner in which the water is used, and must at
all times, frankly and without concealment, answer all questions relative to
consumption of water.
(Prior Code, § 51.008)
§ 51.009 LIMITATIONS ON WATER USE; HOSES.
   Hoses larger than three-fourths’ inch will not be permitted. No hose shall
be used unless water is furnished through a meter. The right is reserved to
suspend the use of fountains and hoses for sprinkling yards and gardens
whenever in the opinion of the Public Works Director, the public exigency may
require.
(Prior Code, § 51.009)
§ 51.010 HYDRANTS; FOUNTAINS.
   No hydrants, except for public drinking fountains, shall be placed within
the limits of any street, and no drinking fountain shall be erected for general
use which has openings by which it can be used as a source of domestic supply;

§ 52.03 PRIVATE WASTEWATER DISPOSAL.
   (A)   Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available under the
provisions of §
52.02(D), the sewer service line shall be connected to a private wastewater
disposal system complying with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Before commencement of construction of a private wastewater disposal
system, the owner(s) shall first obtain a written building permit signed by the
city. The application for such permit shall be made on a form furnished by the
city, which the applicant shall supplement by any plans, specifications, and
other information as are deemed necessary by the city. A permit and inspection
fee shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed.
   (C)   A permit for a private wastewater disposal system shall not become
effective until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the
Building Inspector. The Building Inspector shall be allowed to inspect the work
at any stage of construction, and, in any event, the applicant for the permit
shall notify the Building Inspector when the work is ready for final
inspection, and before any underground portions are covered. The inspection
shall be made within 24 hours of the receipt of notice by the Building
Inspector.
   (D)   The type, capacities, location, and layout of a private wastewater
disposal system shall comply with all requirements of the State Department of
Environment and Energy and County Department of Health. Where requirements of
the two agencies differ, the most stringent requirement shall apply. No permit
shall be issued for any private wastewater disposal system employing subsurface
soil absorption facilities where the area of the lot is less than one acre or
where the absorption facility is within 100 feet of a municipal or private
water well. No septic tank or cesspool shall be permitted to discharge to any
natural outlet.
   (E)   At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served
by a private wastewater disposal system, as provided in division (D) above, a
direct connection shall be made to the public sewer within 30 days in
compliance with this chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar
private wastewater disposal facilities shall be cleaned of sludge and filled
with suitable material.
   (F)   The owner(s) shall operate and maintain the private wastewater
disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the
city.
(Prior Code, § 52.03) Penalty, see §
52.99 
§ 52.04 SANITARY SEWERS, BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   No unauthorized person(s) shall uncover, make any connections with or
open into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof
without first obtaining a written permit from the city.
   (B)   Sewer service line building permits shall be obtained by the owner by
making application on a special form furnished by the city. The permit
application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other
information considered pertinent in the judgment of the city. A permit and
inspection fee shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed.
   (C)   All costs and expense incidental to the installation and connection of
the sewer service line shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall
indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be
occasioned by the installation of the sewer service line.
   (D)   A separate and independent sewer service line shall be provided for
every building except where more than one building stands on an interior lot
and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to any building through
an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway. In this case, the sewer service
line may be extended to the other building and the whole considered as one
sewer service line, but the city does not and will not assume any obligation or
responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such single
connection aforementioned.
   (E)   Old sewer service lines may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and tested by the Building Inspector
to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   (F)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of all sanitary
sewers including sewer service lines, and the methods to be used in excavating,
placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all
conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other
applicable rules and regulations of the city and the state. In the absence of
suitable code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the most current adopted
edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code shall apply.
   (G)   Whenever possible, the sewer service line shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which
any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,
sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved
means and discharged to the building sewer.
   (H)   No person shall engage in or conduct business of sewer connections, or
excavate any trenches for sewer pipe, or open, uncover, or in any manner make
connection with, or lay any sewer or drain, or attach to, modify or repair any
appurtenances to sewer connections in streets or alleys, or other grounds of
the city or with any private sewer or drain without being properly registered
for such work and without holding a license. The connection of the sewer
service line into a public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the
building and plumbing code or other applicable rules of the State Department of
Environment and Energy. All such connections shall be made gastight and
watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed
procedures and materials must be approved by the city before installation.
   (I)   The applicant for the sewer service line permit shall notify the
Building Inspector when the service line is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the
supervision of the Building Inspector or his or her representative.
   (J)   All excavations for sewer service line installation shall be
adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in
the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the

any, may use the same underground trench for their services at a cost to be
agreed upon between the parties.
      (6)   The cost as set forth above (on construction or materials by the
city) shall be paid one-half before the beginning of construction and the
balance shall be paid upon completion.
      (7)   All installation, construction, modification, or repairs of the
systems above described that are the responsibility of the developer (or owner)
are of the owner or developer. This will all be done subject to prior, in the

current which does not pass through the meter furnished him or her by the city.
      (4)   Finding electrical apparatus attached to a power meter or any
device in or near any meter which causes the same to register incorrectly shall
be prima facie evidence of the intent of the occupier of said premises, or of
said consumer, to convert electric current to his or her own use, which is
hereby declared unlawful, and the person convicted of a violation of the same
shall be punished as hereinafter provided; and, in it shall appear to the said
Electric Superintendent that any electrical meter shall have been tapped or
tampered with, he or she is hereby empowered to install or cause to be
installed, at the consumer’s expense a meter installed in iron conduit

assistive mobility device upon any street or public way without having a
registration number plate issued therefore under the direction of the Police
Department displayed upon the frame of such electric personal assistive
mobility device to be plainly visible.

§ 76.01 INTRODUCTION.
   Due to the location of the city, snow, ice, or freezing rain can be expected
between September through April each year. Snow and ice control is basically
emergency work in which city streets must be cleared at any time of the day or
night. Since snow and ice removal is considered an emergency service by the
city, the city shall undertake operations using the methods, resources, and
equipment necessary to keep access to the city as open as possible during snow
events.
(Prior Code, § 76.01) (Ord. 1882, passed 2-9-2009; Ord. 2053-2, passed 12-11-
2017)
§ 76.02 SNOW EMERGENCY DECLARATION.
   (A)   A SNOW EMERGENCY is defined as a special condition of a snowfall event
requiring residents to move their vehicles off the snow emergency routes to
accommodate emergency snow removal.
   (B)   A snow emergency declaration allows for the towing of vehicles from
the emergency snow routes. A snow emergency is normally declared after a
measurable snowfall of two inches or more; however, any amount of snow combined
with ice, rain, and/or wind can also require a snow emergency to be declared.
   (C)   The City Administrator or Public Works Director may declare a snow
emergency. A snow emergency may be declared in advance of an anticipated storm,
to start at a specific time; or a snow emergency may be declared anytime during
or after a storm. A snow emergency will normally not last more than 72 hours
past the end of the last snowfall.
   (D)   The declaration of a snow emergency will be communicated to the public
through mass media outlets as deemed appropriate by the City Administrator,
Transportation Superintendent, or Public Works Director.
(Prior Code, § 76.02) (Ord. 1882, passed 2-9-2009; Ord. 2053-2, passed 12-11-
2017)
§ 76.03 SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTES.
   (A)   Snow emergency routes. A system of marked snow emergency routes has
been established to maintain the flow of traffic, goods and services to the
city on thoroughfare streets. The marked snow emergency routes are established
as follows:
Street Location
Street                          Location
7th Street                      From M Street to Country Club Road

2017) Penalty, see §
76.99
§ 76.04 DRIVEWAYS AND SNOW REMOVAL FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (A)   City snowplows will not clear private driveways. The snow placed in
driveways by city plows is a natural result of clearing the streets and is the
responsibility of the property owner to remove.
   (B)   Only on emergency snow routes, when plowed windrows exceed 24 inches,
if time and conditions allow, the city will attempt to plow open private
driveways at the curb line.
   (C)   Snow from a private driveway, private sidewalk, business driveway, or
parking lot may not be placed on a city street.
   (D)   City equipment will not be used to remove piled snow or push snow away
from private property or businesses. Snow will only be removed from city
facilities. Using city equipment to clear snow from private property is a
violation of this code unless it is necessary to allow emergency vehicles
access to the private property for ambulance, fire or police calls.
(Prior Code, § 76.04) (Ord. 1882, passed 2-9-2009; Ord. 2053-2, passed 12-11-
2017) Penalty, see §
76.99
§ 76.05 VEHICLE TOWING DURING DECLARED SNOW EMERGENCIES.
   Vehicles parked on a designated snow emergency route street during a
declared snow emergency are subject to tow without notice to the owners, and at
the owners’ expense. In addition, if a vehicle is left on a public street or
alley on a designated snow route in such a fashion as to hinder snow removal,
that vehicle may be towed at the expense of the owner of the vehicle; provided,
that an attempt was made to contact the owner to have the vehicle moved; and
that either the owner could not be located, or the owner was contacted, that
the owner of the vehicle failed to move the vehicle within 15 minutes after
being contacted.

The city desires to provide safe parks and recreational opportunities for all

event.
      (2)   User shall inform the city at the time he or she submits a special
event permit that he or she intends to use a bounce house as part of the event.
      (3)   Use of the city’s parks and facilities constitutes the user’s
agreement to follow all ordinances, rules, and policies of the city and subject
to all terms and conditions set forth in the special event permit and in a
separately executed bounce house user’s agreement.
      (4)   User shall follow all state, federal, and local laws and

house users at all times shall comply with the manufacturer’s operating
procedures and ensure that users have access to the appropriate manufacturer’s
operating procedures. In order to ensure that users have access to the

§ 94.41 ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of every owner or occupant of real estate in the
city to keep that real estate free of public nuisances. Upon determination by
the City Council that the owner or occupant has failed to keep the real estate
free of public nuisances, notice to abate and remove the nuisance and notice of
the right to a hearing before the City Council and the manner in which it may
be requested shall be given to the owner or occupant, or the owner’s or
occupant’s duly authorized agent, by personal service or certified mail. This
notice shall describe the condition as found by the City Council and state that
the condition has been declared a public nuisance and that the condition must
be remedied at once. Within ten days after the receipt of the notice, if the
owner or occupant of the real estate does not request a hearing or fails to
comply with the order to abate and remove the nuisance, the city shall have the
work done and may levy and assess the costs and expenses of the work upon the
real estate so benefitted in the same manner as other special taxes for
improvements are levied and assessed.
   (B)   If the owner or occupant requests in writing a hearing with the City
Council, the City Council shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be
held. Notice of the hearing shall be given by personal service or certified
mail and require the owner or occupant to appear before the City Council to
show cause why the condition should not be found to be a public nuisance and
remedied. This notice shall be given not less than seven nor more than 14 days
before the time of the hearing. Upon the date fixed for the hearing and
pursuant to the notice, the City Council shall hear all objections made by the
owner or occupant and shall hear evidence submitted. If, after consideration of
all the evidence, the City Council finds that the condition is a public
nuisance, it shall, by resolution, order and direct the owner or occupant to
remedy the public nuisance at once. If the owner or occupant refuses or
neglects to promptly comply with the order of the City Council, the City
Council shall proceed to cause the abatement of the described public nuisance
and may levy and assess the costs and expenses of the work upon the real estate
so benefitted in the same manner as other special taxes for improvements are
levied and assessed.
   (C)   If after the City Council has determined that a public nuisance exists
in accord with the provisions and procedures set forth herein above, and the
property owner and or tenant fails or refuses to comply with the City Council’s
order to remedy the public nuisance within the time proscribed by the City
Council, and the City Council is forced to abate and remedy the nuisance, the
City Council may, in its discretion, employ the following procedure in its
abatement of the nuisance.
      (1)   Personal property which is reasonably estimated to have a value of
less than $250 or less shall be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by
the City Council or its agents. Personal property reasonably estimated to have
a value in excess of $250 shall be disposed of at public auction by competitive
bidding.
      (2)   Notice of the time and place of the public sale shall be given by
publishing the same once a week for no less than two consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county where the public sale is to be
held. The sale shall be held at the nearest suitable place to the place where
the subject property is held or stored. The advertisement shall include a
description of the property to be sold, the name of the owner of the property,
and the time and place of the sale. The sale shall take place no sooner than
ten days after the first publication. The last publication shall be no less
than five days before the sale is to be held.
      (3)   In addition to the notice provided for herein, notice of public
sale shall be served personally or by first-class mail, postage prepaid, upon
the owner of the subject property prior to the first published notice of the
sale, and shall contain one of the following statements, as appropriate:
         (a)   “You are hereby notified that the Gering City Council has
elected to abate the public nuisance by public sale. If you fail to remedy or
remove the nuisance property, it will be sold at public sale after notice of
the sale has been given by publication. You have the right to bid on the
property at this sale. After the property is sold and the costs of storage,
advertising, and sale are deducted the remaining money will be turned over to
the State Treasurer pursuant to the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property
Act, being Neb. RS 69-1329 et seq. You may claim the remaining money from the
office of the State Treasurer as provided in such act;” or
         (b)   “Because the property subject to abatement is believed to be
worth less than $250, it may be kept, sold, or destroyed without further notice
if you fail to remove the subject property within the time indicated in this
notice.”
      (4)   Any such notice of sale shall describe all or a portion of the
property to be sold in a manner reasonably adequate to permit the owner of the
property to identify the subject property.
       (5)   After deduction of the reasonable costs of storage, advertising,
and sale, any proceeds from the sale not claimed by the person(s) having an
interest in the sale proceeds shall, not later than 30 days after the date of
said sale, be remitted to the State Treasurer for disposition pursuant to the
Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act.
      (6)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the property
owner from bidding on the property which is subject to sale. The successful
bidder’s title shall be subject to the ownership rights, liens, and security
interests, if any, which have priority by law.

the walk. The Public Works Director with the aid of the Street Superintendent,
and the Committee on Public Works Director shall allocate the cost of sidewalk
improvement to the adjoining lots or parcels of land and prepare all necessary
data for assessment sheets.
(Prior Code, § 95.49)
§ 95.50 SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   In case of corner lots, such lots shall not be charged with the costs of so
much additional walk as was required to be laid for the intersection of the
walks abutting the frontage of such lots, but all walks beyond the outer edge
of the sidewalk line shall be laid at the cost of the city. The cost of
construction, widening, repairing, or rebuilding any sidewalks shall be levied
by resolution, upon the lot or parcel of ground fronting and adjoining which
such sidewalks are laid, widened, repaired, or rebuilt, which resolution shall
specify the street upon which such walk had been so constructed, widened,
repaired, or rebuilt, and the length and width of each walk constructed,
widened, repaired, or rebuilt fronting on any lot or piece of ground. Such
assessment shall be made by the Council, sitting as a Board of Equalization, at
a special meeting by resolution, fixing the valuation of the lots assessed,
taking into account the benefits derived or injuries sustained in consequence
of such improvement, and the amount charged against the same, which, with the
vote thereon, by yeas and nays, shall be spread upon the minutes. Notice of the
time and place of holding such meeting and the purpose for which it is to be
held shall be published in a legal newspaper published or of general
circulation in the city, at least four weeks before the same shall be held or
in lieu thereof, personal service may be made upon the person owning the
property to be assessed. All such assessments shall be known as “special
assessments for improvement” and shall be levied and collected as a separate
tax in addition to the tax for general purposes, to be placed upon the tax roll
for collection, subject to the same penalties and collected in like manner as
other city taxes. Whenever any such special tax is levied, the Clerk shall
forthwith deliver a certified copy of such resolution to the County Clerk who
shall place the same on the tax list to be collected by law as in such cases
made and provided.
(Prior Code, § 95.50)
§ 95.51 UNIFORMITY REQUIRED.
   All sidewalks in the fire limits shall be laid with the inner edges thereof
plumb with the lot line and of such width as the Mayor and Council shall, by
resolution, from time to time, fix. All other sidewalks within the city shall
be at least five feet in width and the inner edge of the walk shall be placed
at such distance from the lot line as the Mayor and Council by resolution,
shall, from time to time, fix; provided, however, nothing herein shall be
construed to apply to walks along public buildings outside the fire limits
which may be ordered by the Mayor and Council to be constructed of greater
width, and provided further, where sidewalks are hereafter constructed outside
the fire limits adjoining sidewalks previously put in place and not in
accordance with the requirements of this section, the Public Works Director in
his or her discretion, may authorize the placing of such new sidewalks so as to
conform insofar as possible with previous structures; and the Public Works
Director is hereby vested with authority to waive the requirements of this
section and to direct the width and location of sidewalks in such manner as he
or she may deem feasible to secure uniformity as to sidewalks in the same
block.

   All sidewalks and curbs or combination curb and gutter hereafter constructed
in the city shall be composed of concrete or artificial stone, and shall be
composed and constructed as follows: In the construction of all concrete walks,
the surface of the ground shall be reduced to the proper grade and solidly
tamped so as to give the walk when finished a slope toward the abutting street
of one inch, if possible, to every four feet in width. In this, a foundation
not less than four inches thick shall be laid, which shall be evenly and
smoothly troweled. All cement walks shall be laid with a cutoff in at least
every 50 feet of walk by inserting a strip of wood or an asphalt expansion
joint, one-half-inch thick extending through to the ground. One-course cement
construction in building sidewalks shall only be permitted and allowed.
(Prior Code, § 95.52)
§ 95.53 CURBS; SPECIFICATIONS.
   All curbs in the corporate limits, until established curb lines shall have
been run and adopted by action of the Council shall be constructed with the
inner edges thereof at such distance from the lot line as the Public Works
Director shall fix in the permit for their construction, as this subchapter
required; provided, whenever paving districts shall hereafter be created, the
curbs on such streets included therein shall be constructed at such distance
from the lot line as the plans and specifications for such street improvement
indicate. All curbs, combination curbs, and gutters and sidewalks hereafter
constructed shall be placed on lines established by and at the elevations
provided in such official table of grades as may hereafter be provided for and
adopted by the Council; provided, that in all cases where curbs on unpaved
streets are to be erected adjoining curbs previously put in place, and not in
accordance with the requirements of this section, the Public Works Director, in
his or her discretion, may authorize the placing of such new curbs so as to
conform in the best possible manner to previous structures, and the Public
Works Director shall have authority to waive the requirements of this section
and to direct the location of curbs in such manner as he or she may deem
feasible.
(Prior Code, § 95.53)
§ 95.54 SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION.
   The construction of all sidewalks and curbs shall be in accordance with
plans and specifications prepared by the Engineer and their construction shall
be supervised by and under the control of the Engineer, Street Superintendent,
and/or Committee on Public Works Director. It shall be unlawful to construct
any sidewalk or curb until stakes have been set for line and grade by the
Engineer.

   (B)   The following shall apply to the PEG Channel.
      (1)   The city is solely responsible for the content it provides over the

that the interests of the subscribers are negatively affected, then a cable
operator shall be considered in default of this chapter.
   (B)   Examples of a default shall include, but are not limited to:
bankruptcy (except for a reorganization as long as the cable operator is in

the franchise agreement or this chapter, to include the failure to operate its
cable system; provided:
      (1)   It is not the city’s intention to subject a cable operator to
penalties, fines, forfeitures, or revocation of a franchise for violations
where the violation was a good faith error that resulted in no or minimal
negative impact on the subscribers within the city, or where strict performance
would result in practical difficulties and hardship to a cable operator which
outweighs the benefit to be derived by the city and/or subscribers; and
      (2)   Events in the nature of force majeure or conditions which cannot be
corrected because they are matters reasonably beyond the ability of the
affected cable operator to anticipate and control shall not be considered a
default. This provision includes, but is not limited to, severe or unusual
weather conditions, fire, flood, or other acts of God, strikes, work delays
caused by failure of utility providers to service, maintain or monitor their
utility poles to which a cable operator’s cable system is attached, as well as
unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work
necessary; provided, however, such noncompliance shall only be excused for as
long as the cable operator is reasonably pursuing compliance.
   (C)   In the event that a default occurs, the city shall provide written
notice of the default to the affected cable operator. The notice of default
shall specify the violation(s).
   (D)   The cable operator shall have 30 days from the receipt of the written
notice to bring itself into compliance so that it is no longer in default of
its franchise or this chapter, as the case may be; provided, however, if by the
nature of default, the default cannot be cured within this 30-day period, the
cable operator shall initiate reasonable steps to remedy the default and notify
the city of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be
completed.
   (E)   (1)   If the cable operator fails to cure its default within the time
period provided for above, the matter shall be set for public hearing before
the Council to be held within 75 days after the notice of default was mailed to
the cable operator.
      (2)   Written notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall be
sent to the cable operator at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing.
   (F)   (1)   At the hearing, the cable operator shall have an opportunity to
state its position on the matter, present evidence and question witnesses.

continuance of the hearing has not been granted by the Council, then the cable
operator may be declared in default of the franchise agreement.
   (G)   If the default has not been resolved by the time of or as a result of
the hearing, the Council may, after the public hearing, direct the cable
operator to take corrective action within a specified period of time, or may
declare the cable operator in default of the franchise agreement, and revoke or
terminate the franchise. The Council’s action shall be delivered to the cable
operator in writing within 15 days of the Council’s action.
   (H)   If the Council directs corrective action to be taken and the cable
operator does not rectify the default within the time specified, then the
Council may without further notice declare the cable operator to be in default
and revoke or terminate the franchise.
   (I)   If the cable operator fails to comply with any determination by the
Council, which determination is not stayed or overturned by order of an
appropriate court, then the city shall have any and all remedies available to
it by law; provided, the cable operator may continue to operate the cable
system until all legal appeals procedures have been exhausted.

those portions of its cable system required to provide telecommunications
services or other non-cable service to the extent that the cable operator
lawfully provides telecommunications services or other non-cable service over
the cable system.
   (B)   If a cable operator has failed to commence removal of its cable
system, or such part as designated by the city, within 120 days after written
demand for removal is given, or if the cable operator has failed to complete
such removal within twelve months after written demand for removal is given,
the city may apply funds secured by the franchise agreement toward removal.

§ 130.29 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall, or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including

Code for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles, being Neb. RS 71-
4604.01; the State Uniform Standards for Modular Housing Units Act, being Neb.
RS 71-1555 et seq.; or the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The City Council may require that a manufactured home be located
and installed according to the same standards for foundation system, permanent
utility connections, setback, and minimum square footage which would apply to a
site-built, single-family dwelling on the same lot. The City Council may also
require that manufactured homes meet the following standards:
         (a)   The home shall have no less than 900 square feet of floor area;
         (b)   The home shall have no less than an 18-foot exterior width;
         (c)   The roof shall be pitched with a minimum vertical rise of two

§ 150.087 INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS.
   It is intended by this section to waive building, plumbing, and electrical
inspection requirements insofar as the prebuilt home has the pertinent building
construction, electrical, or plumbing installed and enclosed in such a manner
that, to require an inspection thereof would necessitate damaging the rebuilt
home in order to view the object of an inspection. It is not the intent of this
section to waive any building, electrical, or plumbing inspection which can be
performed without damaging any part of the prebuilt home to perform the
inspection, or which could have been performed had construction at the location
of the permanent situs of the prebuilt home not proceeded past the point where
such an inspection could have been performed without damaging the prebuilt home
had an inspection been called for at an appropriate time.

interest in, or who appear or claim to own or have an interest in the lot or
tract and the building or structure, as well as evidence and arguments
submitted by the Building Inspector and other interested persons.
   (B)   If, after consideration of such evidence and arguments, the City
Council shall find that the building or structure is an unsafe building or
structure and, as the case may be, a nuisance, it shall by ordinance so
determine, and shall in such ordinance order, in accordance with the provisions
of §
150.134, that the building or structure be repaired, rehabilitated, vacated,
or, as the case may be, demolished.
   (C)   If the order is to repair or rehabilitate the building or structure,
the order shall specify the repairs or rehabilitation work to be done and the
time, which shall be a reasonable one, within which the repairs or
rehabilitation is to be completed, and shall require that such repairs or
rehabilitation work be done by the owner or, as the case may be, by the lessee
or occupant of the building or structure. If the order is to vacate the
building, the order shall specify the time within which the building shall be
vacated. If the order is to demolish the building or structure and remove all

removed by the city under the direction of the Building Inspector, and the cost
thereof shall be levied by the City Council as a special assessment against the
land, and the assessment shall be a lien on the real estate and be collected in
the manner provided for special assessments. Subsequently, upon written
application of a person affected by the order, the City Council may by
resolution extend the time within which the building or structure is to be
repaired, rehabilitated, vacated, or demolished by the owner if the City
Council shall make a finding that repair, rehabilitation, vacation, or
demolition of the building or structure within the time limited by the order
would cause undue hardship to such person.

Council has ordered the building or structure vacated, that occupancy or use of
the building or structure is unlawful.

§ 150.145 DEMOLITION; REMOVAL OF DEBRIS.
   (A)   If the City Council shall order a building or structure repaired or
demolished and the debris removed by the city as provided in §
150.143, and the owner shall fail or refuse to comply with the order in whole,
or in part, within the time specified in the order, the Building Inspector
shall in writing so report to the City Administrator and submit to the City
Administrator an estimate by the City Engineer concerning the cost of the
repair or demolition and removal, and a recommendation concerning the manner in
which the repair, demolition, and removal shall be effected.
   (B)   If it shall appear to the City Administrator that the aggregate cost
of the repair or demolition and removal of work will not exceed the sum of
$7,500, the City Administrator, shall in writing so determine and, in this
sound discretion, shall order either that the repair or demolition and the
removal work be done by employees of the city under the direction of the
Building Inspector, or that the work be done by a private contractor, subject
to inspection and approval of the work by the Building Inspector.
   (C)   If the City Administrator shall determine that the work shall be done
by employees of the city under the direction of the Building Inspector, the
Building Inspector shall proceed with the repair or demolition of the building
or structure and removal from the lot or tract of all materials and debris, and
he or she shall place the lot or tract in a safe condition.
   (D)   If the City Administrator shall determine that the work shall be done
by a private contractor, he or she shall also determine in writing whether the
taking of bids would be likely to result in the lowest cost and, depending upon
his or her decision in that respect, shall make appropriate arrangements for a
contract with a private contractor for that purpose. Such bids may be solicited
in any manner which, in the sound discretion of the City Administrator, is the
best suited for eliciting the lowest and best bid, but the bids shall be in
writing.
   (E)   No repair, demolition, or removal work shall be commenced by a private
contractor until a written contract therefor shall have been signed by the
contractor and the city, the latter, by the Mayor or, in case of his or her
absence or disability, by the President of the City Council. If it shall appear
to the City Administrator that the aggregate cost of the repair or demolition
and removal work will exceed the sum of $7,500, the City Administrator shall in
writing so determine, and shall submit to the City Council the estimate of cost
prepared by the City Engineer, together with a recommendation by the City
Administrator that the city advertise for bids for such work.
   (F)   All repair, demolition, or removal work done by a private contractor,
whether done pursuant to a bid accepted by the City Council, or otherwise,
shall be subject to inspection and approval by the Building Inspector.

   (A)   Where pursuant to an order of the City Council, an unsafe building or
structure has been repaired or demolished and the materials and debris removed
or, as the case may be, is about to be repaired or demolished and removed, the
Building Inspector shall sell, or if there appears to him or her to be a
substantial doubt whether the gross proceeds of sale will exceed the expenses
of sale, shall otherwise dispose of the materials and debris. The sale shall be
at private sale or public auction, as will in the discretion of the Building
Inspector be likely to realize the largest amount of proceeds after payment of
the expenses of sale. The proceeds of sale shall be applied in payment, in the
following order, of:
      (1)   The expenses of sale;
      (2)   The expenses incurred by the city in the proceedings to have the
building or structure determined to be an unsafe building and, as the case may
be, a nuisance and, if a special assessment is to be made, the estimated
expense of levying such assessment;

encumbrancer, or other person having an interest in the building or structure,
as their interest may appear. If any of such expenses shall have been paid by
the city prior to the sale, the proceeds shall be paid into the fund out of
which the expenses were paid, to the same extent that they would have been
applied in payment of the expenses had the expenses not been paid initially out
of the fund.

dead vegetation, broken windows or doors, electricity, water, or other
utilities turned off, statements by neighbors, passers-by, delivery agents, or
government agents, among other evidence.
