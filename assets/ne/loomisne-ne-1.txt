Nebraska.
   (D)   All official bonds of village officers shall be executed by the
principal named in such bonds and by at least two sufficient sureties who shall
be freeholders of the county in which such bonds are given, or any official
bond of a village officer may be executed by the officer as principal and by a
guaranty, surety, fidelity or bonding company as surety, or by two or more such
companies. Only such companies as are legally authorized to transact business
in this state shall be eligible to suretyship on the bond of a village officer.

Board may, by resolution, fix a reasonable time within which the officer may
give a new bond or additional sureties as directed. If the officer fails,
refuses or neglects to give a new bond or additional sureties to the

      (2)   The prevention of needless injury to the reputation of an
individual. Such challenge shall be overruled only by a majority vote of the

be closed to the public.

from his or her seat and address himself or herself to the presiding officer
and while speaking shall confine himself or herself to the question. When two,
or more persons rise at once, the Chairperson shall recognize the one who spoke
first. All resolutions or motions shall be reduced to writing before being
acted upon, if requested by the Village Clerk, or any member of the governing
body. Every member of the governing body who is present when a question is
voted upon, shall cast his or her vote unless excused by a majority of the
governing body present. No motion shall be put or debated unless seconded. When
seconded, it shall be stated by the Chairperson before being debatable. In all
cases where a motion or resolution is entered on the minutes, the name of the
member of the governing body making the motion, or resolution shall be entered
also. After each vote, the “Yeas” and “Nays” shall be taken, and entered in the
minutes upon the request of any member of the governing body. Before the vote
is actually taken, any resolution, motion or proposed ordinance may be
withdrawn from consideration by the sponsor thereof with the consent of the
member of the governing body seconding the said resolution, motion or
ordinance.  When, in the consideration of an ordinance, different times or
amounts are proposed, the question shall be put on the largest sum, or the
longest time. A question to reconsider shall be in order when made by a member
voting with the majority, but such motion to reconsider must be made before the
expiration of the third regular meeting after the initial consideration of the
question. When any question is under debate, no motion shall be made,
entertained or seconded except the previous question, a motion to table and to
adjourn. Each of the said motions shall be decided without debate. Any of the
rules of the governing body for meetings may be suspended by a two-thirds vote
of the members present. In all cases in which provisions are not made by these

vehicles which the structure can safely withstand and shall cause suitable
signs stating the maximum speed to be erected and maintained before each end of
the structure.

at any intersection, place, or part of the state highway system outside of the
corporate limits of cities and villages as well as inside the corporate limits
of cities and villages on freeways which are part of the state highway system,

§ 90.36  DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS DOGS.
   (A)   Dangerous dogs.
      (1)   Definition.DANGEROUS DOG means any dog that, because of its
aggressive nature, training or characteristic behavior, presents a risk of
serious physical harm or death to human beings, or would constitute a danger to
human life, physical well-being or property if not kept under the direct
control of the owner. This definition shall not apply to dogs utilized by law
enforcement officers in the performance of their duties. The term DANGEROUS DOG
includes any dog that according to the records of either the village or any law
enforcement agency:
         (a)   Has aggressively bitten, attacked, endangered or inflicted
severe injury on a human being on public or private property, or when
unprovoked, has chased or approached a person upon the street, sidewalks or any
public grounds in a menacing fashion or apparent attitude of attack, provided
that such actions are attested to in a sworn statement by one or more persons

         (b)   Has more than once severely injured or killed a domestic animal
while off the owner’s property; or
         (c)   Has been used primarily or in part for the purpose of dog
fighting, or is a dog trained for dog fighting.
      (2)   Procedure for declaring a dog dangerous.
         (a)   The Village Clerk or any adult person may request under oath
that a dog be classified as dangerous as defined above by submitting a sworn,
written complaint on a form approved by the village. Upon receipt of such
complaint, the Village Clerk shall notify the owner of the dog that a complaint
has been filed and that an investigation into the allegations as set forth in
the complaint will be conducted.
         (b)   At the conclusion of any investigation, the Village Clerk may:
            1.   Determine that the dog is not dangerous and, if the dog is
impounded, waive any impoundment fees incurred and release the dog to its
owner; or
            2.   Determine that the dog is dangerous and order the owner to
comply with the requirements for keeping dangerous dogs set forth herein, and
if the dog is impounded, release the dog to its owner after the owner has paid
all fees incurred for the impoundment. If all impoundment fees have not been
paid within ten business days after a final determination that a dog is
dangerous, the Village Clerk may cause the dog to be humanely destroyed.
      (3)   Notification of dangerous dog declaration.
         (a)   Within five business days after declaring a dog dangerous, the
Village Clerk shall notify the owner by certified mail of the dog’s designation
as a dangerous dog and any specific restrictions and conditions for keeping the
dog, as set forth in this section. The Village Clerk shall also notify the
Chairperson of the Village Board of the designation of any dog as a dangerous
dog. Such notification shall describe the dog and specify any particular
requirements or conditions placed upon the dog owner.
         (b)   The notice shall inform the dog owner that he or she may
request, in writing, a hearing to contest the Village Clerk’s finding and
designation within five business days after delivery of the dangerous dog
declaration notice.
         (c)   If the Village Clerk cannot with due diligence locate the owner
of a dog that has been seized pursuant to this section, the Village Clerk shall
cause the dog to be impounded for not less than five business days. If after
five days, the owner fails to claim the dog, the Village Clerk may cause the
dog to be humanely destroyed.

      (3)   Procedure for citation. The Village Clerk or any person having
knowledge that someone owns, possesses, keeps, exercises control over,
maintains, harbors, transports or sells a vicious dog in the village, shall
file with the Village Clerk a sworn affidavit setting forth the basis on which
they believe the animal to be a vicious dog, the name and address of where the
dog is kept, and a description of the dog. The Village Clerk shall serve notice
upon the person who owns, possesses, keeps, exercises control over, maintains,
harbors, transports or sells the alleged vicious dog, that such affidavit has
been filed. The person who is given the notice shall have ten days from the
service of the notice to inform the Village Clerk in writing that he or she
does not believe that the alleged vicious dog falls within the provisions of
this section. The person who is given the notice shall also have ten days from
the service of notice to inform the Village Clerk in writing that he or she
believes that the alleged vicious dog does fall within the provisions of this
section, in such case, there shall be an irrefutable presumption that said dog
is a vicious dog under the provisions of this section, and the Village Clerk
shall cite the person in accordance with the provisions of this section. Should
said person who is given notice fail to respond within ten days to the Village
Clerk, there shall be an irrefutable presumption that said dog is a vicious dog
under the provisions of this section and shall cite the person who is given
notice, in accordance with the provisions of this section. Should said person
give notice in writing to the Village Clerk that he or she does not believe the
alleged vicious dog falls within the provisions of this section, then the
Village Clerk shall serve upon said person a notice requiring that he or she
shall bring said alleged vicious dog to a veterinarian for inspection to
determine whether the dog is a vicious dog by definition as set forth in this
section. The veterinarian shall have the option of drawing blood from the dog
and have DNA testing completed for the purpose of making this determination. In
the event that the veterinarian determines that the dog is a vicious dog as set
forth by definition in this section, the Village Clerk shall cite the owner of
the alleged vicious dog in accordance with the provisions of this section. The
cost of the veterinarian and any DNA testing shall be paid by the owner. Should
the person fail to bring the dog to the veterinarian for inspection as
instructed, there shall be an irrefutable presumption that said dog is a
vicious dog, and the Village Clerk shall cite the person in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
      (4)   Trial and order of the court. Whenever any person is charged with
owning, possessing, keeping, exercising control over, maintaining, harboring,
transporting or selling a vicious dog as defined in this section, that person
shall, to the satisfaction of the court, remove said dog from the village until
the trial on the citation. If the owner fails to remove the dog within 48 hours
of the service of the citation, the Village Clerk shall impound the dog until
the trial on the citation. If the dog is determined by plea or trial to be a
vicious dog provided by this section, the court shall in addition to ordering
the payment of fine, order the owner to pay all impoundment fees, veterinarian
and DNA testing fees, and order that the dog shall not be returned to or kept
in the village. Any person convicted hereunder who returns the vicious dog or
keeps the vicious dog in the village after being convicted hereunder, shall be
subject to contempt of court or prosecuted as a separate violation of this
section. Each day the dog is kept in the village shall be deemed a separate
violation.
   (C)   Request for determination by Village Clerk. Any person who may be
subject to this section may make a written request to the Village Clerk to
determine whether and how the provisions of this section may apply to him or
her and the dogs subject to the provisions of this section. No enforcement of
the section may be taken while this written request is being considered by the
Village Clerk. If the Village Clerk determines this section is applicable, the
individual will be informed of the amount of time he or she has to comply with
the section.

for nuisances in the village as defined by the village code. The Nuisance

Officer shall document said nuisance with photographs and other evidence
pertinent to the situation. The Nuisance Officer will also obtain the legal
description of the property and identify the current owners and, if possible,
the occupants of the property upon which the nuisance exists.
      (2)   The Nuisance Officer shall then present this information to the
village governing board at a regular or special meeting for its confirmation
that a nuisance exists as stated in §
92.04.
(Ord. 3-18, passed 6-13-2018)
§ 92.04  ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Generally. The nuisance, health and/or sanitation violation is brought
to the governing body by the Village Nuisance Officer, or the board of health
or upon the governing body’s own action. The governing body then may declare by
resolution a nuisance, health and/or sanitation violation.
      (1)   The nuisance, health and/or sanitation ordinances may be enforced
by:
         (a)   Village administrative procedures;
         (b)   Penal prosecutions through the courts; and/or
         (c)   By civil procedures in the courts.
      (2)   Any of these procedures, or any combination of these procedures,
may be used to enforce the nuisance, health and/or sanitation ordinances of the
village.
   (B)   Administrative procedure. The village may proceed with abatement of
the nuisance, sanitation and/or health violation with or without court
involvement after the following procedure is followed.
      (1)   After a nuisance is declared, the Village Clerk notifies the
Nuisance Officer to serve notice upon the violator(s).
      (2)   The Nuisance Officer shall prepare and serve notice which shall
describe the found nuisance and state the required date of abatement and
removal of the nuisance shall be accomplished. The notice shall also provide
information as to how the interested parties may request a hearing before the
governing body described in division (B)(4) below.
      (3)   The notice shall be given to each owner or owner’s duly authorized
agent and to the occupant, if any, by personal service or certified mail. If
notice by personal service or certified mail is unsuccessful, said notice shall
be given by a single publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the
village or county of the village, and by conspicuously posting the notice on
the lot or ground upon which the nuisance is to be abated and removed. The date
of service is determined by the later of certified mail receipt, personal
service or publication date.
      (4)   The accused violator (owner/agent/occupant) may request in writing
a hearing before the governing body of the village within five days after
notice of violation is served or published. For tree nuisance violations, the
period for requesting a hearing is extended to 30 days after service.
      (5)   If no request for a hearing is received in the required time
period, the governing body may cause a hearing to be held. This option is at
the sole discretion of the governing body to be used in exceptional cases.
      (6)   If a hearing is requested, the Village Clerk shall fix a date of
said hearing to be no later than 15 days from receipt of the request for the
hearing. Notice of said hearing and with the date and time shall be served upon
the agent, owner and occupant of the nuisance property by certified and regular
mail.
      (7)   The hearing shall be a “show cause” hearing in which the agent,
owner, occupant of the nuisance property (objecting property) shall provide
evidence why the alleged condition should not be found to be a public nuisance
and remedied. This hearing shall be heard before a quorum of the governing
body. The presiding official of the governing body may conduct the hearing, or
said presiding official may appoint another person as the hearing officer, to
conduct the hearing (said hearing officer may be the Village Attorney or the
enforcement officer). At the hearing, the hearing officer shall mark and
receive evidence which was presented when the finding of a nuisance was made,
relevant evidence of the nuisance since that time, and evidence that the
notices were properly given. The objecting party shall then provide its
evidence. The rules of evidence are not required at said hearing, but all
evidence must be relevant to the particular nuisance being heard. Testimony
shall be under oath as administered by the hearing officer, or any person so
designated by the hearing officer, and the person providing the testimony is
subject to the laws of perjury. Evidence may be submitted in writing by
affidavit.
      (8)   No later than 14 days after the hearing and consideration of the
evidence, the governing board may by majority vote rescind the resolution of
violation. If the resolution of violation is not rescinded, it shall stand.
Furthermore, if the objector or its designated agent fails to appear at the
hearing or does not provide evidence, the nuisance shall stand. If the
resolution is not rescinded, the governing board may, by resolution, extend the
date that owner, occupant, lessee or mortgagee shall abate and remedy the said
public nuisance, but in no case shall this time exceed 60 days. The findings of
the governing board shall be made no later than 14 days after the hearing and
notice of its finding shall be served upon the objecting party by regular U.S.
mail within five days of the finding. The finding of this hearing is final,
provided that an interested party or parties may appeal such decision to the
appropriate court for adjudication.
      (9)   If the Nuisance Officer determines the nuisance is not remedied and
abated within the time period designated, the village shall cause the abatement
of the nuisance.
      (10)   If an interested party properly appeals to an appropriate court
the findings and orders of the village, the village actions shall be stayed
during until such time that the legal proceedings are completed or dismissed.
In cases of appeal from an action of the village condemning real property as a
nuisance or as dangerous under the police powers of the municipality, the
owners of the adjoining property may intervene in the action at any time before
trial.

SALE AND ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY; PUBLIC WORKS
§ 93.30  SALE AND CONVEYANCE; REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (G) of this section, the power of the
village to convey any real property owned by it, including land used for park
purposes and public squares, except real property used in the operation of
public utilities, shall be exercised by resolution, directing the sale at
public auction or by sealed bid of that property and the manner and terms of
such sales, except that the property shall not be sold at public auction or by
sealed bid when:
      (1)   The property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of
federal or state grants or programs;
      (2)   The property is being conveyed to another public agency; or
      (3)   The property consists of streets and alleys.
   (B)   The Board of Trustees may establish a minimum price for real property
at which bidding shall begin or shall serve as a minimum for a sealed bid.
   (C)   After the passage of the resolution directing the sale, notice of all
proposed sales of property described in division (A) of this section and the
terms of such sales shall be published once each week for three consecutive
weeks in a legal newspaper in or of general circulation in the village.
   (D)   (1)   If within 30 days after the third publication of the notice a
remonstrance petition against the sale is signed by registered voters of the
village equal in number to 30% of the registered voters of the village voting
at the last regular village election held therein and is filed with the Board
of Trustees, that property shall not then, nor within one year thereafter, be
sold. If the date for filing the petition falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday, the signatures shall be collected within the 30-day period, but
the filing shall be considered timely if filed or postmarked on or before the
next business day.
      (2)   Upon the receipt of the petition, the Board of Trustees, with the
aid and assistance of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk, shall
determine the validity and sufficiency of signatures on the petition. The Board
of Trustees shall deliver the petition to the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified
mail, return receipt requested.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the petition, the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk shall issue to the Board of Trustees a written receipt that the petition
is in the custody of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk. The Election
Commissioner or County Clerk shall compare the signature of each person signing
the petition with the voter registration records to determine if each signer
was a registered voter on or before the date on which the petition was filed
with the Board of Trustees. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
also compare the signer’s printed name, street and number or voting precinct,
and village or post office address with the voter registration records to
determine whether the signer was a registered voter. The signature and address
shall be presumed to be valid only if the Election Commissioner or County Clerk
determines that the printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and
village or post office address match the registration records and that the
registration was received on or before the date on which the petition was filed
with the Board of Trustees. The determinations of the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk may be rebutted by any credible evidence which the Board of
Trustees finds sufficient. The express purpose of the comparison of names and
addresses with the voter registration records, in addition to helping to
determine the validity of the petition, the sufficiency of the petition, and
the qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent fraud, deception, and
misrepresentation in the petition process.
      (4)   Upon completion of the comparison of names and addresses with the
voter registration records, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
prepare in writing a certification under seal setting forth the name and
address of each signer found not to be a registered voter and the signature
page number and line number where the name is found, and if the reason for the
invalidity of the signature or address is other than the nonregistration of the
signer, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall set forth the reason
for the invalidity of the signature. If the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk determines that a signer has affixed his or her signature more than once
to the petition and that only one person is registered by that name, the
Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in writing a certification
under seal setting forth the name of the duplicate signature and shall count
only the earliest dated signature.
      (5)   The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall certify to the
Board of Trustees the number of valid signatures necessary to constitute a
valid petition. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall deliver the
petition and the certifications to the Board of Trustees within 40 days after
the receipt of the remonstrance from the Board of Trustees. The delivery shall
be by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified mail,
return receipt requested.  Not more than 20 signatures on one signature page
shall be counted.
      (6)   The Board of Trustees shall, within 30 days after the receipt of
the petition and certifications from the Election Commissioner or County Clerk,
hold a public hearing to review the remonstrance and certifications and receive
testimony regarding them. The Board of Trustees shall, following the hearing,
vote on whether or not the remonstrance is valid and shall uphold the petition
if sufficient valid signatures have been received.
   (E)   Real estate now owned or hereafter owned by the village may be
conveyed without consideration to the state for state armory sites or, if
acquired for state armory sites, shall be conveyed strictly in accordance with
the conditions of Neb. RS 18-1001 through 18-1006.
   (F)   Following passage of the resolution directing a sale, publishing of
the notice of the proposed sale, and passing of the 30-day right-of-
remonstrance period, the property shall then be sold. The sale shall be
confirmed by passage of an ordinance stating the name of the purchaser and
terms of the sale.

   (G)   Divisions (A) through (F) of this section shall not apply to the sale
of real property if the authorizing resolution directs the sale of real
property, the total fair market value of which is less than $5,000.  Following
passage of the resolution directing the sale of the property, notice of the
sale shall be posted in three prominent places within the village for a period
of not less than seven days prior to the sale of the property. The notice shall
give a general description of the property offered for sale and state the terms
and conditions of sale. Confirmation of the sale by passage of an ordinance may

cause appears why the permit should be denied, except that if it is desired to
construct the sidewalk at any other than the regularly prescribed location,
grade, or elevation, the Overseer of Streets shall submit the application to
the Board of Trustees for determination as to whether the permit should be
granted or denied. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, or cause

be deemed in the best interests of the village.

§ 93.69  VACATING PUBLIC WAYS; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      SPECIAL DAMAGES.  Only those losses or damages or injuries which a
property owner suffers that are peculiar or special or unique to his or her
property and which result from the Board of Trustees vacating a street, avenue,
alley, lane, or similar public way. SPECIAL DAMAGES shall not mean those losses
or damages or injuries that a property owner suffers that are in common with
the rest of the village or public at large, even though those losses or damages
or injuries suffered by the property owner are greater in degree than the rest
of the village or public at large.
   (B)   Whenever the Board of Trustees decides that it would be in the best
interests of the village to vacate a street, avenue, alley, lane, or similar
public way, the Board of Trustees shall comply with the following procedure.
      (1)   Notice. Notice shall be given to all abutting property owners
either by first class mail to their last known address or if there is no known
address then by publishing the notice in a newspaper that is of general
circulation in the village. The content of the notice shall advise the abutting
property owners that the Board of Trustees will consider vacating that street,
avenue, alley, lane, or similar public way at its next regular meeting, or, if
a special meeting is scheduled for the discussion, then the date, time, and
place of that meeting.
      (2)   Consent; waiver.  The Board of Trustees may have all the abutting
property owners sign a form stating that they consent to the action being taken
by the Board of Trustees and waive their right of access. The signing of this
form shall have no effect on claims for special damages by the abutting
property owners but shall create the presumption that the Board of Trustees’
action was proper. If the abutting property owners do not sign the consent/
waiver form, the Board of Trustees may still proceed with vacating the street,
avenue, alley, lane, or similar public way under the authority granted by Neb.
RS 17-558 and 17-559.
      (3)   Ordinance.  The Board of Trustees shall pass an ordinance that
includes essentially the following provisions:
         (a)   A declaration that the action is expedient for the public good
or in the best interests of the village;
         (b)   A statement that the village will have an easement for
maintaining all utilities; and
         (c)   A method or procedure for ascertaining special damages to
abutting property owners.
   (C)   The Chairperson shall appoint three or five or seven disinterested
residents of the village to a special commission to ascertain the amount of
special damages that the abutting property owners are entitled to receive and
which resulted from the Board of Trustees vacating the street, avenue, alley,
lane, or similar public way. The appointees of the special commission shall be
approved by the Board of Trustees. Only special damages shall be awarded to the
abutting property owners.
   (D)   In determining the amount of compensation to award the abutting
property owners as special damages, the commission shall use the following
rule:
   An abutting property owner is entitled to recover as compensation the
difference between the value of the property immediately before and immediately
after the vacating of the street, avenue, alley, lane, or similar public way.
If no difference in value exists, the abutting property owner is entitled to no
compensation.
§ 93.70  CROSSINGS.
   The Board of Trustees may order and cause to be constructed, under the
supervision of the Overseer of Streets, those street, avenue, and alley
crossings as the Board of Trustees deems necessary. When a petition for the
construction of any such crossings is filed by an interested resident in the
office of the Village Clerk, the Village Clerk shall refer the application to
the Overseer of Streets, who shall investigate and make a recommendation to the
Board of Trustees. Action by the Board of Trustees on the application, whether
the application is approved or rejected, shall be considered final.
§ 93.71  NAMES AND NUMBERS.
   The Board of Trustees may at any time, by ordinance, rename any street or
provide a name for any new street. Buildings used for residence or business
purposes and located along those streets shall retain those numbers as the
Board of Trustees may require. It shall be the duty of the Overseer of Streets,

building and give notice to the owner and occupant of the same.

otherwise deteriorated to the extent that it is causing or is likely to cause
damage to or interfere with any street structure, including pavement or
sidewalks.
   (B)   The Village Clerk shall give the property owner notice by registered
letter or certified mail, directed to the last known address of the owner or
the agent of the owner, directing the repair or replacement of the driveway
approach. If within 30 days of mailing the notice the property owner fails or
neglects to cause the repairs or replacements to be made, the Overseer of
Streets may cause the work to be done and assess the cost upon the property
served by the approach.

   Any person desiring to commence or proceed to erect, construct, repair,
enlarge, demolish or relocate any building or dwelling, or cause the same to be
done, shall file with the Village  Clerk an application for a building permit.
The application shall be in writing on a form to be furnished by the Village
Clerk for that purpose. Every such application shall set forth the legal
description of the land upon which the construction or relocation is to take
place, the nature of the use or occupancy, the principal dimensions, the
estimated cost, the names of the owner, architect and contractor, and such
other information as may be requested thereon. The application, plans and
specifications shall be checked and examined by the Village Clerk and if they
are found to be in conformity with the requirements of this chapter and all
other ordinances applicable thereto, the Village Clerk shall issue the said
applicant a permit upon the payment of the permit fee set by resolution of the
governing body. If special circumstances are involved, the governing body shall
examine the application, plans and specifications and if they are in conformity
with the aforementioned requirements, the governing body shall authorize the
Village Clerk to issue the said permit. Whenever there is a discrepancy between
permit application procedures contained herein and those contained in any

BUILDING MOVING
§ 150.15  BUILDING MOVING; REGULATIONS.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to move any
building or structure within the municipality without a written permit to do
so. Application may be made to the Village Clerk, and shall include the present
and future location of the building to be moved, the proposed route, the
equipment to be used and such other information as the Village Clerk may
require. The application shall be accompanied by a certificate issued by the
County Treasurer to the effect that all the provisions regulating the moving of
buildings have been complied with on the part of the owner of the real estate
upon which the said building is presently located. The Village Clerk shall
refer the said application to Law Enforcement for approval of the proposed
route over which the said building is to be moved. The Village Clerk shall then
issue the said permit; provided, that a good and sufficient corporate surety
bond, check or cash in an amount set by motion of the governing body and
conditioned upon moving said building without doing damage to any private or
municipal property is filed with the Village Clerk prior to the granting of any
permit. The governing body shall have the authority to review the said
application if special circumstances are involved, and upon their approval to
direct the Village Clerk to issue said permit. No moving permit shall be
required to move a building that is ten feet wide, or less, and 20 feet long,
or less, and when in a position to move, 15 feet high, or less. In the event it
will be necessary for any licensed building mover to interfere with the
telephone or telegraph poles and wires, or a gas line, the company or companies
owning, using or operating the said poles, wires or line shall upon proper
notice of at least 24 hours, be present and assist by disconnecting the said
poles, wires or line relative to the building moving operation. All expense of
the said disconnection, removal or related work shall be paid in advance by the
licensee unless such disconnection or work is furnished on different terms as
provided in the said company’s franchise. Whenever the moving of any building
necessitates interference with a water main, sewer main, pipes or wire
belonging to the municipality, notice in writing of the time and route of the
said building moving operation shall be given to the various municipal
officials in charge of the municipal utility departments who shall proceed in
behalf of the municipality and at the expense of the mover to make such
disconnections and do such work as is necessary.

   At such time as the building moving has been completed, Law Enforcement
shall inspect the premises and report to the Village Clerk as to the extent of
damages, if any, resulting from the said relocation and whether any municipal
laws have been violated during the said operation. Upon a satisfactory report
from Law Enforcement, the Village Clerk shall return the corporate surety bond,
cash or check deposited by the applicant. In the event the basement, foundation
or portion thereof is not properly filled, covered or in a clean and sanitary
condition, the governing body may apply the money deposited for the purpose of
defraying the expense of correcting the said conditions. If the expense of
correcting the hazardous condition is greater than the amount of the deposit
set by resolution of the governing body, as required herein, the governing body
may recover such excess expense by civil suit or otherwise as prescribed by
law.

rehabilitate or demolish and remove a building or structure which is unsafe and
a public nuisance, the municipality may proceed with the work specified in the
notice to the property owner. A statement of the cost of such work shall be
