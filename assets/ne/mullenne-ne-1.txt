authorize a person to take any official action prior to the beginning of his or
her term of office pursuant to Article XVII, § 5, of the Constitution of
Nebraska.
(Neb. RS 11-105)

instrument by the Chairperson and Village Clerk-Treasurer pursuant to the
approval of the Board of Trustees.

or her official bond executed and approved as provided by law and filed for
record within the time limited by this section, the Village Clerk-Treasurer
shall immediately issue an order to such person to show cause why he or she has
failed to properly file such bond and why his or her office should not be
declared vacant. If such person properly files the official bond within ten
days of the issuance of the show cause order for appointed officials, or before

shall qualify by taking the oath and giving the bond as above directed, but
when such officer has had public funds or property in his or her control, his
or her bond shall not be approved until he or she has produced and fully
accounted for such funds and property. When it is ascertained that the
incumbent of an office holds over by reason of the nonelection or
nonappointment of a successor or of the neglect or refusal of the successor to
qualify, he or she shall qualify anew within ten days from the time at which
his or her successor, if elected, should have qualified.
(Neb. RS 11-117)

successive terms of the same office, but this provision shall not apply to
incorporated surety companies.
(Neb. RS 11-118)

give a new bond or additional sureties as directed. If the officer fails,
refuses or neglects to give a new bond or additional sureties to the
satisfaction and approval of the Board, the office shall, by such failure,
refusal or neglect, become vacant and it shall be the duty of the Board to
appoint a competent and qualified person to fill the office.

enlargement or improvement is assessed to the property, an estimate of the cost
shall be made by the Village Engineer and submitted to the Board of Trustees.
In advertising for bids as provided in divisions (C) and (E) below, the Board
of Trustees may publish the amount of the estimate.
   (C)   Advertisements for bids shall be required for any contract costing

subchapter, the all-purpose levy shall not exceed an annual levy of $1.05 on
each $100 upon the taxable valuation of all the taxable property in the
village. Otherwise authorized extraordinary levies to service and pay bonded

taxes. Such sales and all sales made under or by virtue of this section or the
provision of law herein referred to shall be of the same validity and in all
respects be deemed and treated as though such sales had been made for the
delinquent county taxes exclusively.

of the provisions of this section and a certified map of the village clearly
showing the boundaries thereof, in addition to a certified copy of the election

CROSS-CONNECTIONS
§ 52.035 PURPOSE; APPLICATION; POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose, application and policy.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is:
         (a)   To protect the public potable water supply of the municipal
water system from contamination or pollution by containing within the
consumer’s internal distribution system or private water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water supply system;
         (b)   To promote the elimination, containment, isolation or control of
existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the public or
consumer’s potable water systems and non-potable water systems, plumbing
fixtures and industrial process systems; and
         (c)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
      (2)   Application. This subchapter shall apply to all premises served by
the public potable water system of the municipality.
      (3)   Policy. This subchapter will be reasonably interpreted. It is the
municipality’s intent to recognize the varying degrees of hazard and to apply
the principle that the degree of protection shall be commensurate with the
degree of hazard.
   (B)   Village responsibility and authority.
      (1)   The Municipal Water Department and governing body shall be
primarily responsible for the protection of the public potable water
distribution system from contamination or pollution due to backflow,
contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. The
cooperation of all consumers is required to implement and maintain the program
to control cross-connections. The consumer is responsible for preventing
contamination of the water system with the consumer’s own premises.
      (2)   If, in their judgment or that of their authorized representative,
cross-connection protection is required through either piping modification or
the installation of an approved backflow prevention device, 30 days’ notice
shall be given to the consumer. The failure, refusal or inability on the part
of the consumer to provide requested protection within 30 days shall make the
consumer subject to discontinuance of water service at the discretion of the
Municipal Water Department according to the degree of hazard without further
notice.

a hearing before the governing body of the village within five days after
notice of violation is served or published. For tree nuisance violations, the

body. The presiding official of the governing body may conduct the hearing or
said presiding official may appoint another person as the hearing officer to
conduct the hearing (said hearing officer may be the Village Attorney or the
enforcement officer). At the hearing, the hearing officer shall mark and
receive evidence which was presented when the finding of a nuisance was made,
relevant evidence of the nuisance since that time and evidence that the notices

rules of evidence is not required at said hearing, but all evidence must be
relevant to the particular nuisance being heard. Testimony shall be under oath
as administered by the hearing officer or any person so designated by the
hearing officer, and the person providing the testimony is subject to the laws
of perjury. Evidence may be submitted in writing by affidavit.
      (8)   Not later than 14 days after the hearing and consideration of the
evidence, the governing body may by majority vote rescind the resolution of
violation. If the resolution of violation is not rescinded, it shall stand.

   The village finds that there has been a proliferation of outlets for the
sale of fireworks within the village and that such proliferation has placed an
unacceptable burden on the Fire Marshal, the Police Department and other
village departments in regulating the businesses. In addition, an increased use
of fireworks within the village limits and surrounding areas has caused
additional safety concerns. Therefore, licenses for the retail sale of
fireworks may be issued to no more than 25 not-for-profit charitable, community
or village benevolent organizations which operate on a not-for-profit and
benevolent basis within the village and meet the criteria set forth in this
code.

sale of fireworks at retail to those duly organized and existing not-for-profit
and benevolent organizations or associations meeting the criteria set forth in
division (C) below whose application has been approved for such purposes by the
village. No person issued a retailer’s license shall be authorized to purchase,
sell, store, hold for sale, offer for sale or accept delivery of any fireworks
other than fireworks sold or distributed by a jobber or distributor that has
been licensed by the village for such purposes.

the year in which the application required by this section is submitted and has
actually conducted or engaged in community betterment activity during such
period;

      (3)   Has made application for such license required by division (E)
below.

applicable to the sales of fireworks by the organization for such license year
or otherwise failed to comply with §§
92.57, 92.58 and 92.67; or
      (2)   Had a village retailer’s license revoked by the village.
Thereafter, an organization that was ineligible to receive a village retailer’s
license by application of division (C)(1) above shall remain ineligible until
such organization has paid the applicable sales tax for the deficient license
year and has otherwise satisfactorily complied with §§
92.57,
92.58 and

Treasurer for such purposes and shall include the following:
      (1)   The identity, address and telephone number of a contact person for

of the application the organization is existing, validly organized, in good
standing and certified to do business or operate in the state; provided,
however, that to the extent the organization is not so required (e.g., lodges,

608), the organization shall include such information as may be necessary or
appropriate to evidence to the village that it is validly organized, in good

entitled, in its discretion, to revoke or suspend the organization’s village
retail license (and upon demand the organization shall immediately surrender

   (F)   In any year, if more than 25 duly completed applications from eligible
organizations are received by the Village Clerk-Treasurer and have been
approved by the village, then the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall issue licenses
from among such approved organizations as follows:
      (1)   Those organizations that were issued a similar license by the
village in the immediately preceding license year shall be issued a license;
and
      (2)   In the event that after expiration of the appeal time as outlined

approved by the village (other than by application of divisions (B) or (C)
above), there are less than 25 organizations that have been issued a license by
application of division (F)(1) above, and there remain organizations whose
applications were approved by the village, the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall
issue licenses to a number of approved organizations equal to a number that

appeal shall be allowed to any organization denied a license by the application
of division (F)(2) above. The village shall schedule a hearing before the Board
of Trustees at the next available and regularly scheduled Board of Trustees

all applicable Federal Aviation Administration limitations and requirements
regarding installations close to airports. Evidence of compliance or non-
applicability shall be submitted with the application.
   (H)   Visual impacts. It is inherent that small wind energy systems may pose
some visual impact due to the tower height needed to access the wind resources.
The purpose of this division (H) is to reduce the visual impacts without
restricting the owner’s access to the wind resources.
      (1)   The applicant shall demonstrate through project site planning and
proposed mitigation that the small wind energy system’s visual impact will be
minimized for surrounding neighbors and the community. This may include, but
not be limited to, information regarding site selection, turbine design or
appearance and buffering and screening of ground mounted electrical and control
equipment. All electrical conduits shall be underground.

labeled and secured to prevent unauthorized access.
      (2)   A tower shall be designed and installed so as not to provide step
bolts or a ladder readily accessible to the public for a minimum height of
eight feet above the ground.
(Prior Code, § 9-804) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.05 ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   At such time that a small wind energy system is scheduled to be
abandoned or discontinued, the applicant will notify the village by certified
U.S. mail of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuance of operations.
   (B)   (1)   Upon abandonment or discontinuation of use, the owner shall
physically remove the small wind energy system within 90 days from the date of
abandonment or discontinuance of use. This period may be extended at the
request of the owner at the discretion of the Village Board of Trustees.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, PHYSICALLY REMOVE shall include,
but not be limited to:
         (a)   Removal of the wind turbine and tower and related aboveground
structures; and
         (b)   Restoration of the location of the small wind energy system to
its natural condition, except that any landscaping, grading or below grade
foundation may remain in the after conditions.
   (C)   In the event that an applicant fails to give such notice, the system
shall be considered abandoned or discontinued if the system is out of service
for a continuous 12-month period. After the 12 months of non-service or
inoperability, the Village Board of Trustees may issue a notice of abandonment
to the owner of the small wind energy system. The owner shall have the right to
respond to the notice of abandonment within 30 days from notice receipt date.
The Village Board of Trustees shall withdraw the notice of abandonment and
notify the owner that the notice has been withdrawn if the owner provides
information that demonstrates the small wind energy system has not been
abandoned.
   (D)   If the owner fails to respond to the notice of abandonment, or if
after review and a determination by a designated member of the Board of
Trustees that a small wind energy system has been abandoned or discontinued,
the owner of the small wind energy system shall remove the wind turbine and
tower at the owner’s sole expense within three months of receipt of the notice
of abandonment. If the owner fails to physically remove the small wind energy
system after the notice of abandonment procedure, the village shall have the
authority to enter the subject property, physically remove the small wind
energy system and assess the cost of removal to the property upon which the
system was located in the manner provided for assessing nuisance abatement
costs.
(Prior Code, § 9-805)
§ 151.06 VIOLATION.
   It is unlawful for any person to construct, install or operate a small wind
energy system that is not in compliance with this chapter or with any condition
contained in the conditional use permit issued pursuant to this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 9-806) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   In the event of violation of this chapter, any structure constructed in
violation shall be deemed a nuisance, and the village may proceed by a suit in
equity to enjoin and abate the nuisance in the manner provided by law, or,
whenever in any action it is established that such a nuisance exists, the court
may, together with the fine and penalty imposed, enter an order of abatement as
part of the judgment in the case. In addition thereto, any person violating any
of the terms of this chapter shall be fined $100 for each day that the
violation continues.

SALE AND ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY; PUBLIC WORKS
§ 153.20 SALE AND CONVEYANCE; REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (G) below, the power of the village to
convey any real property owned by it, including land used for park purposes and
public squares, except real property used in the operation of public utilities,
shall be exercised by resolution, directing the sale at public auction or by
sealed bid of that property and the manner and terms of such sales, except that
the property shall not be sold at public auction or by sealed bid when:
      (1)   The property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of
federal or state grants or programs;
      (2)   The property is being conveyed to another public agency; or
      (3)   The property consists of streets and alleys.
   (B)   The Board of Trustees may establish a minimum price for real property
at which bidding shall begin or shall serve as a minimum for a sealed bid.
   (C)   After the passage of the resolution directing the sale, notice of all
proposed sales of property described in division (A) above and the terms of
such sales shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks in a
legal newspaper in or of general circulation in the village.
   (D)   (1)   If, within 30 days after the third publication of the notice, a
remonstrance petition against the sale conforming to Neb. RS 32-628 is signed
by registered voters of the village equal in number to 30% of the registered
voters of the village voting at the last regular village election held therein
and is filed with the Board of Trustees, that property shall not then, nor
within one year thereafter, be sold. If the date for filing the petition falls
upon a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the signatures shall be collected
within the 30-day period, but the filing shall be considered timely if filed or
postmarked on or before the next business day.
      (2)   Upon the receipt of the petition, the Board of Trustees, with the
aid and assistance of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk, shall
determine the validity and sufficiency of signatures on the petition. The Board
of Trustees shall deliver the petition to the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials or by certified
mail, return receipt requested.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the petition, the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk shall issue to the Board of Trustees a written receipt that the petition
is in the custody of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk. The Election
Commissioner or County Clerk shall compare the signature of each person signing
the petition with the voter registration records to determine if each signer
was a registered voter on or before the date on which the petition was filed
with the Board of Trustees. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
also compare the signer’s printed name, street and number or voting precinct
and village or post office address with the voter registration records to
determine whether the signer was a registered voter. The signature and address
shall be presumed to be valid only if the Election Commissioner or County Clerk
determines that the printed name, street and number or voting precinct and
village or post office address match the registration records and that the
registration was received on or before the date on which the petition was filed
with the Board of Trustees. The determinations of the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk may be rebutted by any credible evidence which the Board of
Trustees finds sufficient. The express purpose of the comparison of names and
addresses with the voter registration records, in addition to helping to
determine the validity of the petition, the sufficiency of the petition and the
qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent fraud, deception and
misrepresentation in the petition process.
      (4)   Upon completion of the comparison of names and addresses with the
voter registration records, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
prepare in writing a certification under seal setting forth the name and
address of each signer found not to be a registered voter and the signature
page number and line number where the name is found, and if the reason for the
invalidity of the signature or address is other than the nonregistration of the
signer, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall set forth the reason
for the invalidity of the signature. If the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk determines that a signer has affixed his or her signature more than once
to the petition and that only one person is registered by that name, the
Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in writing a certification
under seal setting forth the name of the duplicate signature and shall count
only the earliest dated signature.
      (5)   The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall certify to the
Board of Trustees the number of valid signatures necessary to constitute a
valid petition. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall deliver the
petition and the certifications to the Board of Trustees within 40 days after
the receipt of the remonstrance from the Board of Trustees. The delivery shall
be by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials or by certified mail,
return receipt requested. Not more than 20 signatures on one signature page
shall be counted.
      (6)   The Board of Trustees shall, within 30 days after the receipt of
the petition and certifications from the Election Commissioner or County Clerk,
hold a public hearing to review the remonstrance and certifications and receive
testimony regarding them. The Board of Trustees shall, following the hearing,
vote on whether or not the remonstrance is valid and shall uphold the petition
if sufficient valid signatures have been received.
   (E)   Real estate now owned or hereafter owned by the village may be
conveyed without consideration to the state for state armory sites or, if
acquired for state armory sites, shall be conveyed strictly in accordance with
the conditions of Neb. RS 18-1001 through 18-1006.
   (F)   Following passage of the resolution directing a sale, publishing of
the notice of the proposed sale and passing of the 30-day right-of-remonstrance
period, the property shall then be sold. The sale shall be confirmed by passage
of an ordinance stating the name of the purchaser and terms of the sale.
(Neb. RS 17-503)
   (G)   Divisions (A) through (F) above shall not apply to the sale of real
property if the authorizing resolution directs the sale of real property the
total fair market value of which is less than $5,000. Following passage of the
resolution directing the sale of the property, notice of the sale shall be
posted in three prominent places within the village for a period of not less
than seven days prior to the sale of the property. The notice shall give a
general description of the property offered for sale and state the terms and
conditions of sale. Confirmation of the sale by passage of an ordinance may be
required.
(Neb. RS 17-503.01)
§ 153.21 SALE AND CONVEYANCE; PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   The power of the village to convey any personal property owned by it
shall be exercised by resolution directing the sale and the manner and terms of
the sale. Following passage of the resolution directing the sale of the
property, notice of the sale shall be posted in three prominent places within
the village for a period of not less than seven days prior to the sale of the
property. If the fair market value of the property is greater than $5,000,

general circulation in the village at least seven days prior to the sale of the
property. The notice shall give a general description of the property offered
for sale and state the terms and conditions of the sale.

division (A) above when:
      (1)   Such property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of
federal or state grants or programs; or
      (2)   Such property is being conveyed to another public agency.

constructed. The Utilities Superintendent shall issue the desired permit unless
good cause appears why the permit should be denied, except that if it is
desired to construct the sidewalk at any other than the regularly prescribed
location, grade or elevation, the Utilities Superintendent shall submit the
application to the Board of Trustees for determination as to whether the permit
should be granted or denied. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct,
or cause to be constructed, such sidewalk at any other location, grade or
elevation than so designated by the village. All sidewalks shall be built and
constructed on the established grade or elevation, and if there is no

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has in Neb. RS 31-1001 through 31-1022 assigned the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations designed to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Therefore, the Village Board of Trustees ordains as follows.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation. The flood hazard
areas of the village are subject to inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   General causes of flood losses. These flood losses are caused by:
      (1)   The cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities; and
      (2)   The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected
from flood damages.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in §
154.02 by applying the provisions of this chapter to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for the
intended purposes because of flood hazard; and
   (D)   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.04 DESIGNATION OF CURRENT MAPS.
   Until a flood hazard boundary map/flood insurance rate map has been
published, any development permit application shall meet the appropriate
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is complete before the effective date
of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   EXPANSION OF EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map of a community, on which
the Administrator has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the
risk premium applicable to the community.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of the river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated
height.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in
states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the
Secretary of the Interior; or
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified
either:
         (a)   By an approved state program, as determined by the Secretary of
the Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without
approved programs.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for the
parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. This term does
not include a “recreational vehicle.”
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the
floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   100-YEAR FLOOD. The condition of flooding having a 1% chance of annual
occurrence.
   PRINCIPALLY ABOVE GROUND. At least 51% of the actual cash value of the
structure is above ground.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is built on a single chassis; 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REGULATORY FLOOD ELEVATION. The water surface elevation of the 100-year
flood.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. No. 97-348))
includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was
issued; provided the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The ACTUAL START means the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as
well as a manufactured home, and a gas or liquid storage tank that is
principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before start of construction of the
improvement. This includes structures which have incurred substantial damage,
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include either any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or any alteration of a
historic structure; provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the terms of a floodplain
management ordinance.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.06 STORAGE OF MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT.
   The storage or processing of materials that are in times of flooding
buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be injurious to human, animal or plant
life is prohibited. Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if
not subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation
or if readily removable from the area within the time available after a flood
warning.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.07 FLOOD-CARRYING CAPACITY WITHIN ANY WATERCOURSE.
   The governing body of the village will ensure that the flood-carrying
capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is
maintained. The village will notify, in riverine situations, adjacent
communities and the state’s coordinating office (State Natural Resources
Commission) prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and the
village will submit copies of such notifications to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. Moreover, the village will work with appropriate state and
federal agencies in every way possible in complying with the National Flood
Insurance Program in accordance with the National Disaster Protection Act of
1973.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
Statutory reference:
   National Disaster Protection Act of 1973, see 42 U.S.C. Ch. 50
§ 154.08 NONCONFORMING USE.
   (A)   A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful
before the passage or amendment of this chapter, but which is not in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter, may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
      (1)   If such use is discontinued for 36 consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this chapter. The utility
departments shall notify the Village Board in writing of instances of
nonconforming uses where utility services have been discontinued for a period
of 36 months.
      (2)   Uses or adjuncts thereof which are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
   (B)   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred, except if it is
reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. This
limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, building or safety codes or regulations or the
cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.09 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existent easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter
imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. All
other ordinances or resolutions inconsistent with this chapter are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.10 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of
any other powers granted by state statutes.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.11 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions, or the flood
height may be increased by human-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris.
   (B)   This chapter does not imply that areas outside floodplain district
boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.12 CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
   This chapter shall take precedence over conflicting ordinances or
resolutions, or parts of ordinances or resolutions. The governing body of the
village may, from time to time, amend this chapter to reflect any and all
changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. The regulations
of this chapter are in compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations, as published in 44 C.F.R. and the 1983 State Floodplain Management
Act.

the lowest floor, including basement, or in the case of floodproofed
nonresidential structures, the elevation to which it shall be floodproofed.
Documentation or certification of such elevations will be maintained by the
Village Clerk-Treasurer; and
      (7)   Give such other information as reasonably may be required by the
Village Clerk-Treasurer (i.e., require a statement from the applicant that he
or she is aware that elevating or floodproofing structures above the minimum
levels will result in premium reduction, especially in the case of
nonresidential floodproofing when a minus one foot penalty is assessed at the
time of rating the structure for the policy premium.)
(Ord. 106, passed - -) Penalty, see §
154.99
§ 154.27 FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT APPLICATION.
   The Village Clerk-Treasurer shall review all development permit applications
to determine if the site of the proposed development is reasonably safe from
flooding and that all necessary permits have been received as required by
federal or state law.
(Ord. 106, passed - -)
§ 154.28 APPLICATION REVIEW.
   The Village Clerk-Treasurer, in reviewing all applications for new
construction, substantial improvements, prefabricated buildings, placement of
manufactured homes and other development(s) (as defined in §
154.05) will:
   (A)   Obtain, review and reasonably utilize, if available, any regulatory
flood elevation data and floodway data available from federal, state or other
sources, until such other data is provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration in a flood insurance study, and require within special flood
hazard areas that the following performance standards be met.
      (1)   Prior to a floodway being designated. No development or substantial
improvement may be permitted within the identified floodplain unless the
applicant has demonstrated that the proposed development or substantial
improvement, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated
developments or substantial improvements, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the 100-year flood more than one foot at any location.
      (2)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation.
      (3)   Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least one
foot above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be floodproofed so that below such a level the structure
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall certify that the standards of this division (A)(3) are
satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the local administrator.
      (4)   Requirements for all new construction and substantial improvements.
Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and
which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria.
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be not higher than one foot
above grade.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters.
   (B)   Require the use of construction materials that are resistant to flood
damage;

subdivision; or
      (4)   In all existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions on which a
manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood,
be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation
and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in
accordance with the provisions of division (F) above.
   (H)   Assure that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within special
flood hazard areas that are not subject to the provisions of division (G) above
be elevated so that either:
      (1)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least one foot
above the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of division (F)
above.
   (I)   Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within the
identified special flood hazard areas either be on the site for fewer than 180
consecutive days; be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or meet the

§ 154.29 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The Village Board, as established by the village, shall hear and
decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   The Village Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by
the Village Clerk-Treasurer in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
   (C)   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Village Board or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court as provided in Neb. RS
19-912.
   (D)   In passing upon such applications, the Village Board shall consider:
      (1)   All technical evaluations, all relevant factors and standards
specified in other sections of this chapter;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (3)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (10)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
      (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (12)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
   (E)   (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing the following items (divisions (E)(2)
through (E)(5) below) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances or resolutions.
      (5)   The applicant shall be given a written notice over the signature of
a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and such
construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions
as required by this chapter.
