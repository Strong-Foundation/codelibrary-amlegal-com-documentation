or payment of money shall require for their passage or adoption the concurrence
of a majority of all elected members of the City Council. The Mayor may vote on
any such matter if the Mayor’s vote is required due to the City Council members
being equally divided or a majority vote of all the elected members of the City
Council cannot be reached due to absence, vacancy, or abstention of one or more
City Council members. For purposes of such vote, the mayor is deemed to be a
member of the City Council.

officers by the City Council shall be made viva voce, and the concurrence of a
like majority shall be required, and the names of those, and for whom they
voted, on the vote resulting in an appointment, shall be recorded. The

provide the additional vote required to attain the number of votes equal to a
majority of the number of members elected to the Council, and the Mayor shall,
for the purpose of such vote, be deemed to be a member of the Council.
   (B)   The Mayor shall have power to veto or sign any ordinance passed by the

claims, he or she shall return it to the City Council, stating that the measure

passed or within seven calendar days after the meeting. If the Mayor issues the
veto after the meeting, he or she shall notify the City Clerk of the veto in
writing. The Clerk shall notify the City Council in writing of the Mayor’s
veto.
   (C)   (1)   Any ordinance, order, bylaw, resolution, award of or vote to
enter into any contract, or the allowance of any claim vetoed by the Mayor may
be passed over his or her veto by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the
Council. If the Mayor neglects or refuses to sign any ordinance, order, bylaw,
resolution, award of or vote to enter into any contract or the allowance of any
claim but fails to veto the measure within the time required by this section,
the measure shall become effective without his or her signature.
      (2)   The Mayor may veto any item or items of any appropriation bill or
any claims bill and approve the remainder thereof, and the item or items vetoed
may be passed by the Council over the veto as in other cases.

§ 31.01 BONDS; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The city may enact ordinances or bylaws to require from all officers
and servants, elected or appointed, bonds and security or evidence of

(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 17-604)
   (B)   (1)   All official bonds of officers of the city shall be in form

single corporate surety fidelity, schedule, position or blanket bond or
undertaking, or evidence of insurance coverage covering all the officers,
including officers required by law to furnish an individual bond or
undertaking, may be furnished. The municipality may pay the premium for the
bond or insurance coverage. The bond or insurance coverage shall be, at a
minimum, an aggregate of the amounts fixed by law or by the City Council and
with such terms and conditions as may be required.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-104)
      (3)   The penalty amount on any bond shall not fall below the legal
minimum, when one has been set by the state, for each particular official.
   (C)   (1)   Official bonds, with the oath endorsed thereon, shall be filed
in the City Clerk’s office within the following time:
         (a)    Of all officers elected at any general election, following
receipt of their election certificate and not later than ten days before the
first Thursday after the first Tuesday in January next succeeding the election;
         (b)   Of all appointed officers, within 30 days after their
appointment; and
         (c)   Of officers elected at any special election and city officers,
within 30 days after the canvass of the votes of the election at which they
were chosen.
      (2)   The filing of the bond with the oath endorsed thereon does not
authorize a person to take any official action prior to the beginning of his or
her term of office pursuant to Article XVII, § 5, of the Constitution of the
state.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-105)
   (D)   All official bonds of city officers shall be executed by the principal
named in such bonds and by at least two sufficient sureties who shall be
freeholders of the county in which such bonds are given, or any official bond
of a city officer may be executed by the officer as principal and by a
guaranty, surety, fidelity or bonding company as surety, or by two or more such
companies. Only such companies as are legally authorized to transact business
in this state shall be eligible to suretyship on the bond of a city officer.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-109)
   (E)   The City Clerk shall carefully record and preserve the bonds in his or
her office and shall give certified copies thereof, when required, under the
seal of his or her office and shall be entitled to receive for the same the
usual fee allowed by law for certified copies of records in other cases.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-110)
   (F)   (1)   The approval of each official bond shall be endorsed upon such
bond by the officer approving the same, and no bond shall be filed and recorded
until so approved.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-111)
      (2)   No bond shall be deemed to be given or complete until the approval
of the City Council and all sureties are endorsed in writing on the instrument
by the Mayor and City Clerk pursuant to the approval of the City Council.
   (G)   All official bonds shall obligate the principal and sureties for the
faithful discharge of all duties required by law of such principal and shall
inure to the benefit of any persons injured by a breach of the conditions of
such bonds.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-112)
   (H)   No official bond shall be rendered void by reason of any informality
of irregularity in its execution or approval.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-113)
   (I)   No city official shall be taken as security on the bond of any
administrator, executor or other officer from whom by law bond is or may be
required.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-114)
   (J)   If any person elected or appointed to any office neglects to have his
or her official bond executed and approved as provided by law and filed for
record within the time limited by this section, the City Clerk shall
immediately issue an order to such person to show cause why he or she has
failed to properly file such bond and why his or her office should not be
declared vacant. If such person properly files the official bond within ten
days of the issuance of the show cause order for appointed officials or before
the date for taking office for elected officials, such filing shall be deemed
to be in compliance with this section. If such person does not file the bond
within ten days of the issuance of such order for appointed officials or before
the date for taking office for elected officials and sufficient cause is not
shown within that time, his or her office shall thereupon ipso facto become
vacant, and such vacancy shall thereupon immediately be filled by election or
appointment as the law may direct in other cases of vacancy in the same office.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-115)
   (K)   Any person appointed to fill a vacancy, before entering upon the
duties of the office, must give a bond corresponding in substance and form with
the bond required of the officer originally elected or appointed, as herein
provided.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-116)
   (L)   When the incumbent of an office is reelected or reappointed, he or she
shall qualify by taking the oath and giving the bond as above directed, but
when such officer has had public funds or property in his or her control, his
or her bond shall not be approved until he or she has produced and fully
accounted for such funds and property. When it is ascertained that the
incumbent of an office holds over by reason of the nonelection or
nonappointment of a successor or of the neglect or refusal of the successor to
qualify, he or she shall qualify anew within ten days from the time at which
his or her successor, if elected, should have qualified.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-117)
   (M)   No person shall be surety for the same officer for more than two
successive terms of the same office, but this provision shall not apply to
incorporated surety companies.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 11-118)
   (N)   If the sureties on the official bond of any appointed officer of the
city, in the opinion of the City Council, become insufficient, the Council may
by resolution fix a reasonable time within which the officer may give a new
bond or additional sureties as directed. If the officer fails, refuses or
neglects to give a new bond or additional sureties to the satisfaction and
approval of the Council, the office shall, by such failure, refusal or neglect,
become vacant, and it shall be the duty of the Council to appoint a competent
and qualified person to fill the office.
§ 31.02 OATH OF OFFICE; CITY OFFICIALS.
   (A)   All officials of the city, whether elected or appointed, except when a
different oath is specifically provided herein, shall before entering upon
their respective duties take and subscribe the following oath, which shall be
endorsed upon their respective bonds:
      “I, ______________________________, do solemnly swear that I will support
the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of
Nebraska, against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely and without
mental reservation or for the purpose of evasion; and that I will faithfully

do not advocate nor am I a member of any political party or organization that
advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States or of this state
by force or violence; and that during such time as I am in this position I will
not advocate nor become a member of any political party or organization that
advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States or of this state
by force or violence. So help me God.”
   (B)   If any such officer is not required to give bond, the oath shall be
filed with the City Clerk.

vote of a majority of its voting members if a closed session is clearly

the closed session shall be identified in the motion to close. Closed sessions
may be held for, but shall not be limited to, such reasons as:
         (a)   Strategy sessions with respect to collective bargaining, real
estate purchases, pending litigation or litigation which is imminent as
evidenced by communication of a claim or threat of litigation to or by the

session, and the time when the closed session commenced and concluded shall be

officer immediately prior to the closed session shall restate on the record the
limitation of the subject matter of the closed session. The public body holding
such a closed session shall restrict its consideration of matters during the
closed portions to only those purposes set forth in the motion to close as the
reason for the closed session. The meeting shall be reconvened in open session
before any formal action may be taken. For the purpose of this section, FORMAL
ACTION means a collective decision or a collective commitment or promise to
make a decision on any question, motion, proposal, resolution, order or
ordinance or formation of a position or policy but shall not include
negotiating guidance given by members of the public body to legal counsel or
other negotiators in closed sessions authorized under division (A)(1)(a) above.
   (C)   Any member of any public body shall have the right to challenge the
continuation of a closed session if the member determines that the session has
exceeded the reason stated in the original motion to hold a closed session or
if the member contends that the closed session is neither clearly necessary for
the protection of the public interest or the prevention of needless injury to
the reputation of an individual. Such challenge shall be overruled only by a
majority vote of the members of the public body. The challenge and its
disposition shall be recorded in the minutes.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that any meeting
be closed to the public.

broadcasting or recording its meetings, including meetings held by virtual
conferencing. A body may not be required to allow citizens to speak at each
meeting, but it may not forbid public participation at all meetings.
   (C)   No public body shall require members of the public to identify
themselves as a condition for admission to the meeting nor shall such body
require that the name of any member of the public be placed on the agenda prior
to such meeting in order to speak about items on the agenda. The body shall
require any member of the public desiring to address the body to identify
himself or herself, including an address and the name of any organization
represented by such person unless the address requirement is waived to protect
the security of the individual.

meeting in a place known by the body to be too small to accommodate the
anticipated audience.
   (E)   No public body shall be deemed in violation of this section if it
holds its meeting in its traditional meeting place which is located in this
state.
   (F)   No public body shall be deemed in violation of this section if it

public body is located outside of this state and the other requirements of Neb.
Rev. Stat. § 84-1412 are met.
   (G)   The public body shall, upon request, make a reasonable effort to
accommodate the public’s right to hear the discussion and testimony presented
at the meeting.

copying by members of the public, at least one copy of all reproducible written
material to be discussed at an open meeting, either in paper or electronic
form. Public bodies shall make available at least one current copy of the Open

his or her comments to the question. When two or more persons rise at once, the
Mayor shall recognize the one who spoke first. All resolutions or motions shall
be reduced to writing before being acted upon, if requested by the City Clerk
or any member of the Council. Every member of the Council who is present when a
question is voted upon shall cast his or her vote unless excused by a majority
of the members of the Council present. No motion shall be put or debated unless
seconded. When seconded, it shall be stated by the Mayor before being
debatable. In all cases where a motion or resolution is entered on the minutes,
the name of the member of the Council making the motion or resolution shall be
entered also. After each vote, the “yeas” and “nays” shall be taken and entered
in the minutes. Before the vote is actually taken, any resolution, motion or
proposed ordinance may be withdrawn from consideration by the sponsor with the
consent of the member of the Council seconding the resolution, motion or
ordinance. When, in the consideration of an ordinance, different times or
amounts are proposed, the question shall be put on the largest sum or the
longest time. A question to reconsider shall be in order when made by a member
voting with the majority, but the motion to reconsider must be made before the
expiration of the third regular meeting after the initial consideration of the
question. When any question is under debate, no motion shall be made,

which are generally applicable to all employees, or all employees within a

ledger kept pursuant to this division (G) shall be available for public
inspection during the normal working hours of the office in which it is kept.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 49-14,103.02)
   (H)   An open account established for the benefit of any governing body with

BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS
§ 32.01 PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   (1)   If the City Council adopts zoning or other regulations pursuant
to Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 19-901 et seq., the Planning Commission shall consist of
five, seven or nine regular members, as specified by the City Council by
ordinance, who shall represent, insofar as is possible, the different
professions or occupations in the city and shall be appointed by the Mayor by
and with the approval of a majority vote of the members elected to the City
Council. Two of the regular members may be residents of the area over which the
city is authorized to exercise extraterritorial zoning and subdivision
regulation. When there are 500 residents in the area over which the city
exercises extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation, one regular
member of the Commission shall be a resident from such area. If it is
determined by the City Council that 500 residents reside in the area subject to
extraterritorial zoning or subdivision regulation, and no such resident is a
regular member of the Commission, the first available vacancy on the Commission
shall be filled by the appointment of such an individual. A number of
commissioners equal to a majority of the number of regular members appointed to
the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business.
All regular members of the Commission shall serve without compensation. The
term of each regular member shall be three years, except that one-third or
fewer of the regular members of the first commission to be so appointed shall
serve for terms of one year, one-third or fewer for terms of two years, and the
remaining members for terms of three years. All regular members shall hold
office until their successors are appointed. Any member may, after a public
hearing before the Council, be removed by the Mayor with the consent of a
majority vote of the members elected to the Council for inefficiency, neglect
of duty or malfeasance in office or other good and sufficient cause. Vacancies
occurring otherwise than through the expiration of term shall be filled for the
unexpired portion of the term by the Mayor.
      (2)   The Mayor may, with the approval of a majority vote of the elected
members of the Council, appoint one alternate member to the Planning
Commission. The alternate member shall serve without compensation. The term of
the alternate member shall be three years, and he or she shall hold office
until his or her successor is appointed and approved. The alternate member may
be removed from office in the same manner as a regular member. If the alternate
member position becomes vacant other than through the expiration of the term,
the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the Mayor
with the approval of a majority vote of the elected members of the Council. The
alternate member may attend any meeting and may serve as a voting and
participating member of the Commission at any time when less than the full
number of regular Commission members is present and capable of voting.
      (3)   A regular or alternate member of the Planning Commission may hold
any other municipal office except:
         (a)   Mayor;
         (b)   A member of the City Council;
         (c)   A member of any community redevelopment authority or limited
community redevelopment authority created under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 18-2102.01;
or
         (d)   A member of any citizen advisory review committee created under
Neb. Rev. Stat. § 18-2715.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-926)
   (B)   The Commission shall elect its Chairperson from its members and create
and fill such other of its offices as it may determine. The term of the
Chairperson shall be one year, and he or she shall be eligible for reelection.
The Commission shall hold at least one regular meeting in each calendar
quarter, except as provided in this section. The City Council may require the
Commission to meet more frequently and the Chairperson of the Commission may
call for a meeting when necessary to deal with business pending before the
Commission. If no business is pending before the Commission, the Chairperson
may cancel a quarterly meeting, but no more than three quarterly meetings may
be cancelled per calendar year. The Commission shall adopt rules and
regulations for the transaction of business and shall keep a record of its
resolutions, transactions, findings and determinations, which shall be a public
record.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-927)
   (C)   No member of the Commission shall serve in the capacity of both the
Chairperson and Secretary of the Commission. The Secretary shall keep the full
and correct minutes and records of all meetings and file them with the City
Clerk where they shall be available for public inspection during office hours.
   (D)   The City Council may provide the funds, equipment and accommodations
necessary for the work of the Commission, but the expenditures of the
Commission, exclusive of gifts, shall be within the amounts appropriated for
that purpose by the Council; and no expenditures nor agreements for
expenditures shall be valid in excess of such amounts.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-928)
   (E)   (1)   (a)   Except as provided in Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 19-930 through
19-933, the Planning Commission shall:
            1.   Make and adopt plans for the physical development of the city,
including any areas outside its boundaries which in the Commission’s judgment
bear relation to the planning of such city and including a comprehensive
development plan as defined by Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-903;
            2.   Prepare and adopt such implemental means as a capital
improvement program, subdivision regulations, building codes and a zoning
ordinance in cooperation with other interested city departments; and
            3.   Consult with and advise public officials and agencies, public
utilities, civic organizations, educational institutions and citizens with
relation to the promulgation and implementation of the comprehensive
development plan and its implemental programs. The Commission may delegate
authority to any such group to conduct studies and make surveys for the
commission, make preliminary reports on its findings and hold public hearings
before submitting its final reports.
         (b)   The City Council shall not take final action on matters relating
to the comprehensive development plan, capital improvements, building codes,
subdivision development, the annexation of territory or zoning until it has
received the recommendation of the Planning Commission; provided, that the
Planning Commission shall make its recommendation so that it is received by the
City Council within 60 days after the Commission begins consideration of a
matter or within such other number of days as the City Council has set by
ordinance.
         (c)   A recommendation from the Planning Commission shall not be
required for subdivision of existing lots and blocks whenever all required
public improvements have been installed, no new dedication of public rights-of-
way or easements is involved, and such subdivision complies with the ordinance
requirements concerning minimum areas and dimensions of such lots and blocks,
if the City Council has designated by ordinance an agent pursuant to Neb. Rev.
Stat. § 19-916.
      (2)   (a)   The Commission may, with the consent of the City Council, in
its own name make and enter into contracts with public or private bodies,
receive contributions, bequests, gifts or grant funds from public or private
sources, expend the funds appropriated to it by the city, employ agents and
employees and acquire, hold and dispose of property.
         (b)   The Commission may on its own authority make arrangements
consistent with its program, conduct or sponsor special studies or planning
work for any public body or appropriate agency, receive grants, remuneration or
reimbursement for such studies or work, and at its public hearings, summon
witnesses, administer oaths and compel the giving of testimony.
      (3)   (a)   The Commission may grant conditional uses or special
exceptions to property owners for the use of their property if the City Council
has, through a zoning ordinance or special ordinance, generally authorized the
Commission to exercise such powers and has approved the standards and
procedures adopted by the Commission for equitably and judiciously granting
such conditional uses or special exceptions. The granting of a conditional use
permit or special exception shall only allow property owners to put their
property to a special use if it is among those uses specifically identified in
the zoning ordinance as classifications of uses which may require special
conditions or requirements to be met by the owners before a use permit or
building permit is authorized.
         (b)   The power to grant conditional uses or special exceptions shall
be the exclusive authority of the Commission, except that the City Council may
choose to retain for itself the power to grant conditional uses or special
exceptions for those classifications of uses specified in the zoning ordinance.
The Council may exercise such power if it has formally adopted standards and
procedures for granting such conditional uses or special exceptions in a manner
that is equitable and will promote the public interest.
         (c)   An appeal of a decision by the Commission or Council regarding a
conditional use or special exception shall be made to the district court.

through 19-933
§ 32.02 BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.
   (A)   If the City Council adopts zoning or other regulations pursuant to
Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 19-901 et seq., except as provided in division (B) below,
the Council shall provide for the appointment of a Board of Adjustment. Any
actions taken by the Board of Adjustment shall not exceed the powers granted by
division (F) below.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-907)
   (B)   If the county has adopted a comprehensive development plan, as defined
by Neb. Rev. Stat. § 23-114.02, and is enforcing zoning regulations based upon
such a plan, the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the county shall, upon request
of the City Council, serve as the Zoning Board of Adjustment for the city. If
the city is located in more than one county, it shall be served by request or
otherwise only by the County Zoning Board of Adjustment of the county in which
the greatest area of the city is located, and the jurisdiction of such County
Zoning Board of Adjustment shall include all portions of the city and its
extraterritorial control, regardless of county lines.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-912.01)
 
   (C)   (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall consist of five regular members,
plus one additional member designated as an alternate who shall attend and
serve only when one of the regular members is unable to attend for any reason,
each to be appointed for a term of three years and removable for cause by the
appointing authority upon written charges and after public hearings. Vacancies
shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant.
One member only of the Board of Adjustment shall be appointed from the
membership of the Planning Commission, and the loss of membership on the
Planning Commission by such member shall also result in his or her immediate
loss of membership on the Board of Adjustment and the appointment of another
Planning Commissioner to the Board of Adjustment. The first vacancy occurring
on the Board of Adjustment shall be filled by the appointment of a person who
resides in the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction of the city at such time as
more than 200 persons reside within such area if the Board does not already
include such a person. Thereafter, at all times, at least one member of the
Board of Adjustment shall reside outside of the corporate boundaries of the
city but within its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules in accordance with the
provisions of any ordinance adopted pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 19-901
through 19-914. Meetings of the Board of Adjustment shall be held at the call
of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. Such
Chairperson, or in his or her absence the Acting Chairperson, may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall
be open to the public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing
the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote,
indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other
official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the
Board and shall be a public record.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-908)
   (D)   A number of members equal to a majority of the number of regular
members appointed to the Board of Adjustment shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of any business. All members of an appointed Board of Adjustment
shall serve without compensation and shall hold no other city office except for
the member of the Planning Commission appointed to serve on the Board of
Adjustment. No member of the Board of Adjustment shall serve in the capacity of
both Chairperson and Secretary of the Board. The Secretary shall keep the full
and correct minutes and records of all meetings and file them with the City
Clerk where they shall be available for public inspection during office hours.
   (E)   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the city affected
by any decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken
within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with
the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board of Adjustment a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the
appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An
appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless
the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment,
after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him or her, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
of Adjustment or by a court of record on application on notice to the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. The Board of Adjustment
shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice
thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same
within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or
by agent or by attorney.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-909)
   (F)   (1)   The Board of Adjustment shall, subject to such appropriate
conditions and safeguards as may be established by the City Council, have only
the following powers:
         (a)   To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is error in
any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative
official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation
or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures, except
that the authority to hear and decide appeals shall not apply to decisions made
by the City Council or Planning Commission regarding a conditional use or
special exception under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-929(3);
         (b)   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of any
zoning regulation, requests for interpretation of any map; and
         (c)   When by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape
of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning
regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property,
the strict application of any enacted regulation under Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 19-
901 and 19-903 through 19-904.01 and this division (F) or division (C) above
would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or
exceptional and undue hardships upon the owner of such property, to authorize,
upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance from such strict
application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship, if such relief may
be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without
substantially impairing the intent and purpose of any ordinance or resolution.
      (2)   (a)   No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it
finds that:
            1.   The strict application of the zoning regulation would produce
undue hardship;
            2.   Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in
the same zoning district and the same vicinity;
            3.   The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be
changed by the granting of the variance; and
            4.   The granting of such variance is based upon reason of
demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit or caprice.
         (b)   No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the
condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the
property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably
practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an
amendment to the zoning regulations.
      (3)   In exercising the powers granted in this division (F), the Board
may, in conformity with Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 19-901 through 19-915, reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of
the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members
of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of any such administrative official or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such
regulation or to effect any variation in such regulation.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-910)
   (G)   Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision
of the Board of Adjustment, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board
or bureau of the city, may present to the district court a petition duly
verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and
specifying the grounds of such illegality. Such petition must be presented to
the court within 15 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the
Board. Upon the filing of such petition, a summons shall be issued and be
served upon the Board of Adjustment, together with a copy of the petition.
Return of service shall be made within four days after the issuance of the
summons. Within ten days after the return day of such summons, the Board of
Adjustment shall file an answer to the petition which shall admit or deny the
substantial averments of the petition and shall state the contentions of the
Board with reference to the matters in dispute as disclosed by the petition.
The answer shall be verified in like manner as required for the petition. At

      (7)   The City Council may allow testimony or evidence via
teleconference, video conference or similar electronic means. Each party to the
proceeding shall have the opportunity to hear (or, for a videoconference, to
both hear and see) testimony given in this manner and to question the person
giving such testimony. Any costs associated with electronic conferencing shall
be borne by the party requesting it.
      (8)   At the hearing, a city representative shall first present evidence

of a majority of the Council members to vote to reverse or modify the removal,
demotion or suspension shall be construed as a vote to uphold the removal,
demotion or suspension. The decision of the Council shall be based upon its
determination that, under the facts and evidence presented at the hearing, the
challenged removal, demotion or suspension was necessary for the proper
management and effective operation of the Police Department in the performance
of its duties under the statutes of the state.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the peremptory
suspension or immediate removal from duty of an officer by the appropriate
authority, pending the hearing authorized by this section and §

such city has been in default in the payment of interest thereon or principal
thereof for a period of ten years prior to the date of the passage of the
resolution providing for the submission of the proposition for establishment of
the sinking fund as required in division (C) below.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-1302)
   (C)   Before any sinking fund or funds are established or before any annual
tax is levied for any such planned city improvements mentioned in division (B)
above by the city, the City Council shall declare its purpose by resolution to
submit to the qualified electors of the city at the next general city election
the proposition to provide the city with the specific city improvement planned
under this section. The resolution of submission shall, among other things, set
forth a clear description of the improvement planned, the estimated cost
according to the prevailing costs, the amount of annual levy over a definite
period of years, not exceeding ten years, required to provide such cost, and
the specific name or designation for the sinking fund sought to be established
to carry out the planned improvement, together with a statement of the
proposition for placement upon the ballot at the election. Notice of the
submission of the proposition, together with a copy of the official ballot
containing the proposition, shall be published in its entirety three successive
weeks before the day of the election in a legal newspaper in or of general
circulation in the city or, if no legal newspaper is in or of general
circulation in the city, in a legal newspaper in or of general circulation in
the county in which the city is located. No such sinking fund shall be
established unless the same has been authorized by a majority or more of the
legal votes of the city cast for or against the proposition. If less than a
majority of the legal votes favor the establishment of the sinking fund, the
planned improvement shall not be made, no annual tax shall be levied therefor,
and no sinking fund or sinking funds shall be established in connection
therewith, but such resolution of submission shall immediately be repealed. If
the proposition shall carry at such election in the manner prescribed in this
division (C), the City Council and its successors in office shall proceed to do
all things authorized under such resolution of submission but never
inconsistent with this section. The election provided for under this section
shall be conducted as provided under the Election Act, being Neb. Rev. Stat. §§
32-101 et seq.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-1303)
   (D)   All funds received by the City Treasurer, by donation or by tax levy,
as hereinbefore provided, shall, as they accumulate, be immediately invested by
the Treasurer, with the written approval of the City Council, in the manner
provided in §
34.08. Whenever investments of such sinking fund or funds are made, as
aforesaid, the nature and character of the same shall be reported to the City
Council, and the investment report shall be made a matter of record by the City
Clerk in the proceedings of the City Council. The sinking fund, or sinking
funds, accumulated under the provisions of this section, shall constitute a
special fund, or funds, for the purpose or purposes for which the same was
authorized and shall not be used for any other purpose unless authorized by 60%
of the qualified electors of the city voting at a general election favoring
such change in the use of the sinking fund or sinking funds. The question of
the change in the use of the sinking fund or sinking funds, when it fails to
carry, shall not be resubmitted in substance for a period of one year from and
after the date of such election.

qualifying mutual financial institutions of approved and responsible standing,
all money collected, received or held by him or her as City Treasurer. These

(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 17-607)
   (B)   The insurance afforded to depositors in banks, capital stock financial
institutions or qualifying mutual financial institutions through the Federal

corporation, and for deposits so insured or guaranteed, no other surety bond or
bonds or other security shall be required.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 77-2362)

warrants were purchased.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 17-608)
   (B)   All income received by the city from public utilities and from the
payment and collection of water taxes, rents, rates or assessments shall be
applied to the payment of running expenses, interest on bonds or money borrowed
and the erection and construction of public utilities; should there be any
surplus, it shall be annually created into a sinking fund for the payment of
public utility bonds or for the improvements of the works, or into the General
Fund as the Council may direct. The surplus remaining, if any, may, if the
Council so directs, be invested in interest-bearing bonds or obligations of the
United States.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 17-540)
   (C)   The Mayor and City Council may by resolution direct and authorize the
Treasurer to dispose of the surplus electric light, water or gas funds, or the

waterworks, power plant, ice plant, gas plant, sewerage, heating or lighting
plant or distribution system by the Board of Public Works, or by the City
Council, where any of such utilities are not being operated by such a Board,
may be invested, if not invested pursuant to the provisions of any other law
upon the subject, in like manner and subject to the same conditions as the
investment of similar funds of cities of the first class, as provided in Neb.
Rev. Stat. § 16-691.01.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 17-803)
   (E)   (1)   Whenever the city has accumulated a surplus of any fund in
excess of its current needs or has accumulated a sinking fund for the payment
of its bonds and the money in such sinking fund exceeds the amount necessary to
pay the principal and interest of any such bonds which become due during the
current year, the City Council may invest any such surplus in excess of current
needs or such excess in its sinking fund in certificates of deposit, in time
deposits and in any securities in which the State Investment Officer is
authorized to invest pursuant to the State Capital Expansion Act, being Neb.
Rev. Stat. §§ 72-1260 et seq. and the State Funds Investment Act and as
provided in the authorized investment guidelines of the State Investment
Council in effect on the date the investment is made. The State Investment

§ 34.10 ALL-PURPOSE LEVY; EXTRAORDINARY LEVIES; ALLOCATION; ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   Notwithstanding provisions in the statutes of the state and this code
to the contrary, for any fiscal year the City Council may decide to certify to
the County Clerk for collection one all-purpose levy required to be raised by
taxation for all city purposes instead of certifying a schedule of levies for
specific purposes added together. Subject to the limits of state law, the all-
purpose levy shall not exceed an annual levy of $1.05 on each $100 upon the
taxable valuation of all the taxable property in the city. Otherwise authorized
extraordinary levies to service and pay bonded indebtedness of the city may be
made by the city in addition to such all-purpose levy.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-1309)
   (B)   If the method provided in division (A) above is followed in city

other legal manner, as the City Council deems wisest and best.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 19-1310)
   (C)   If the city elects to follow the method provided in division (A)

§ 34.11 NATURAL GAS FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   The city hereby establishes a franchise fee on every natural gas
company and every other person, firm or corporation, their successors and
assigns, owning, operating, controlling, leasing or managing a natural gas
plant or system and/or generating, manufacturing, selling, distributing or
transporting natural gas (hereinafter referred to, collectively, as “energy
providers,” each, individually, an “energy provider”). Energy providers shall
collect from their customers located within the corporate limits of the city as
depicted on the map (but not from the city) and pay to the city an amount equal
to 3% of gross receipts energy providers derive from the sale, distribution or
transportation of natural gas delivered within the present or future limits of
the city. Gross receipts as used herein are revenues received from the sale,
distribution, or transportation of natural gas, after adjustment for the net
write-off of uncollectible accounts and corrections of bills theretofore
rendered. The amount paid by energy providers shall be in lieu of, and energy
providers shall be exempt from, all other fees, charges, taxes or assessments
which the city may impose for the privilege of doing business within the city,
including, without limitation, excise taxes, occupation taxes, licensing fees
or right-of-way permit fees, and in the event the city imposes any such fee,
charge, tax or assessment, the payment to be made by energy providers in
accordance with this section shall be reduced in an amount equal to any such
fee, charge, tax or assessment imposed upon the energy providers. Ad valorem
property taxes imposed generally upon all real and personal property within the
city shall not be deemed to affect energy providers’ obligations under this
section.
   (B)   Energy providers shall report and pay any amount payable under this
section on an annual basis. Such payment shall be made no more than 30 days
following the close of the period for which payment is due. Initial and final
payments shall be prorated for the portions of the periods at the beginning and
end of any franchise granted by the city to an energy provider.
   (C)   Energy providers shall list the franchise fee collected from customers
as a separate item on bills for utility service issued to their customers. If
at any time the State Public Service Commission or other authority having
proper jurisdiction prohibits such recovery, energy providers will no longer be
obligated to collect and pay the franchise fee. In addition, energy providers
may reduce the franchise fee payable for natural gas delivered to a specific
customer when such reduction is required to attract or retain the business of
that customer.
   (D)   Within ten days of the date of this section, the city shall provide
the energy providers with a map of its corporate limits (the “map”). The map
shall be of sufficient detail to assist energy providers in determining whether
their customers reside within the city’s corporate limits. The map along with
energy provider’s geographic information system (“GIS”) mapping information
shall serve as the sole basis for determining energy provider’s obligation
hereunder to collect and pay the franchise fee from customers; provided,
however, that if the city’s corporate limits are changed by annexation of
otherwise, it shall be the city’s sole responsibility to update the map so that
such changes are included therein, and provide the updated map to the energy
providers. An energy provider’s obligation to collect and pay the franchise fee
from customers within an annexed area shall not commence until the later of 60
days after such energy provider’s receipt from the city of an updated map
including such annexed area, or such time after such energy provider’s receipt
from the city of an updated map including such annexed area as is reasonably
necessary for such energy provider to identify the customers in the annexed
area obligated to pay the franchise fee. In addition, energy providers shall
not be liable for paying franchise fees from or to any customer incorrectly
identified by the city or by the energy provider, as being subject to the
franchise fee or being subject to a different level of franchise fees or being
exempt from the imposition of franchise fees.
   (E)   The city shall have access to and the right to examine, during normal
business hours, such of an energy provider’s books, receipts, files, records
and documents as is reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of payments due
hereunder; provided, that the city shall not exercise such right more than
twice per calendar year. If it is determined that a mistake was made in the
payment of any franchise fee required hereunder, such mistake shall be
corrected promptly upon discovery such that any under-payment by an energy
provider shall be paid within 30 days of recalculation of the amount due, and
any over-payment by an energy provider shall be deducted from the next payment
of such franchise fee due by such energy provider to the municipality;
provided, that neither party shall have the obligation to correct a mistake
that is discovered more than one year after the occurrence thereof.

circumstances and, if the budget requirements are to be increased, the reasons
why the previously adopted budget of expenditures cannot be reduced during the
remainder of the current year to meet the need for additional money in that
manner;
      (4)   A copy of the summary of the originally adopted budget previously
published; and

be referred to as registered warrants and shall be repaid during the next
fiscal year from funds derived from taxes levied therefor.
   (E)   Within 30 days after the adoption of the budget under §

required from property taxes. No public hearing shall be required for such a
correction. After correction, the City Council shall file a copy of the
corrected budget with the County Clerk of the county or counties in which the

elected to receive such notices by electronic delivery. If notice is given by
first class mail or electronic delivery, such notice shall be conspicuously
marked as to its importance. Service shall not be discontinued for at least
seven days after notice is sent or given. Holidays and weekends shall be
excluded from the seven days. A public or private utility company shall not

certify that a domestic subscriber or resident within such subscriber’s
household has an existing illness or handicap which would cause such subscriber
or resident to suffer an immediate and serious health hazard by the
disconnection of the utility’s service to that household. Such certificate
shall be filed with the utility within five days of receiving notice under this
section, excluding holidays and weekends, and will prevent the disconnection of
the utility’s service for a period of at least 30 days from such filing. Only
one postponement of disconnection shall be required under this division (C)(7)
for each incidence of nonpayment of any past-due account;
      (8)   The cost that will be borne by the domestic subscriber for
restoration of service;

the office of the City Clerk, are hereby incorporated by reference in addition
to any amendments thereto and are made a part of this section as though set out
in full.
   (G)   This section shall not apply to any disconnections or interruptions of
services made necessary by the utility for reasons of repair or maintenance or
to protect the health or safety of the domestic subscriber or of the general
public.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 70-1615)

contrivance in any manner interfere with or obstruct the action or operation of
any meter made or provided for measuring or registering the amount or quantity
of electricity, electric current, gas or water passing through it, without the
knowledge and consent of any city utility supplying the electricity, electric
current, gas or water passing or intended to pass through the meter.
   (B)   Proof of the existence of any wire, pipe or conduit connection or
reconnection or of any injury, alteration, interference or obstruction of a
meter is prima facie evidence of the guilt of the person in possession of the
premises where that connection, reconnection, injury, alteration, interference
or obstruction is proved to exist.

Stat. § 25-1801.
(Neb. Rev. Stat. § 25-21,276)
   (C)   (1)   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a tenant or
occupant at any premises where bypassing, tampering or unauthorized metering is
proven to exist caused or had knowledge of that bypassing, tampering or
unauthorized metering if the tenant or occupant:
         (a)   Had access to the part of the utility supply system on the

any city sewage disposal plant and sewerage system is not paid when due, such
sum may be recovered by the city in a civil action or it may be certified to

limited to, normal domestic water usage, fire protection flows and ability to
serve future undeveloped areas that may eventually desire to receive water
service from the city.
   (B)   In order that these service conditions shall continue to be met, the
city may require that water mains be oversized in capacity above what might be
considered adequate to serve a sole and specific area or development. The
decision on the proper sizing of water mains within the city or within its
planning and service areas shall rest solely with the city.
   (C)   In the event that a development or entity desires to connect to and
extend service from an existing city water main, the city shall determine the
unused capacity of the water main to be connected to or extended, whether or
not a connection or extension can be allowed and the size of the water main
connection and the size of the water main to be extended.
   (D)   If it is determined that the water main has unused capacity to allow a
connection or extension, the city may approve of the connection or extension
and shall determine its size. If there is no possibility of future water
service requests or expansion beyond the development’s or entity’s use, then
the size of the extended main shall be based on that development’s or entity’s
sole use. However, if future water service is possible to areas beyond the
development’s or entity’s use, then the main shall be sized to accommodate that
future use as well. The determination of future use shall rest solely with the
city.
   (E)   The city may extend a water main to serve subdivisions or
developments. The approval of such extension, and the provisions of the
extension, shall be in accordance with the city’s water main extension and
pioneering policy.

§ 52.093 WATER TREATMENT CAPITAL FACILITIES CHARGE.
   (A)   The customer, upon approval of his or her application for water
services, shall pay to the Water Department a water treatment capital
facilities charge to compensate the city for the expense of providing the
capital facilities needed to process and treat the potable water supply to be
used by the customer.
   (B)   The water treatment capital facilities charges shall be in accordance
with the following schedule.
 
For each acre of commercial or industrial property $3,000
For each acre of park, common area or outlots*     $3,000
For each acre of residential multi-family property $3,300
For each residential, duplex lot                   $1,480
For each residential, single-family lot            $1,100
*Any outlot that is an existing lake will not pay water treatment capital
facilities charges. In the event that a new lake is intentionally created as
part of a new development, the City Council shall determine if water treatment
capital facilities charges will be due for the lake outlot.
 
   (C)   The water treatment capital facilities charge shall be collected by
the City Treasurer at the time of the application for water service, provided
that:
      (1)   Credit shall be given for the amount of prepayment, if any, for the
property being connected; and
      (2)   The applicant furnishes proof of prepayment made on the property
sought to be connected.
   (D)   The water treatment capital facilities charges connection policy for
new subdivisions and developments shall be as follows.
      (1)   The first one-half of the water treatment capital facilities
charges for all residential, commercial and industrial property shall be
collected by the City Clerk/Treasurer from the developer of the subdivision’s
owner prior to the signing of the subdivision’s final plat.
      (2)   The final one-half of the water treatment capital facilities
charges for all residential, commercial and industrial property shall be
collected from the applicant at the time the application for water service is
made.
      (3)   One hundred percent of the water treatment capital facilities
charges for park, common area or outlots shall be collected from the developer
of the subdivision’s owner prior to the signing of the subdivision’s final
plat.
   (E)   The city may consider an alternate method of determining the water
treatment capital facilities charges for commercial and industrial properties
which exceed five acres in size, and where the water demand and impact on the
city’s infrastructure is not commensurate with large land areas needed for the
commercial or industrial entity to function. Examples of large area
requirements would include storage of raw and finished materials or staging of
transportation loading and unloading activities. The alternate calculation
would be based on water main taps needed for fire protection. The alternate
charge system would be as follows:
      (1)   Capital facility charge.
Meter Size Charge
Meter Size      Charge
5/8-inch        $1,100
1/2-inch        $1,650
1-inch          $2,750
1 1/2-inch      $5,500
2-inch disc     $8,800
2-inch turbo    $17,600
3-inch compound $17,600
3-inch turbo    $38,500
 
      (2)   Connection tap charge.
 
Size Tap Charge
4-inch   $1,400
6-inch   $1,600
8-inch   $1,800
 
         (3)   Notes. The above charges would apply to each meter in each
building. The minimum capital facility charge would be $15,000 (i.e., five
acres at $3,000 per acre).
         (4)   Alternative method. The use of the alternative method of
determining water capital facilities charges is not an elective of the
commercial or industrial property and is reserved solely for use by the city if
needed. The implementation of the alternative method and the sizing of meters
and connections to sewer mains will be determined by the City Engineer and City
Council.

§ 52.094 DEPOSIT.
   (A)   All new applicants for service from the city water system shall be
required to pay a deposit in the amount of $150 to the Water Department before
such water service is supplied. From such deposit, the city may, without
notice, deduct all delinquent water rents or any unpaid claims due to the Water
Department.
   (B)   The Water Department shall refund the water deposit to each water
consumer after a period of not less than one year; provided, that the water
consumer’s account is in good standing.
   (C)   If the water deposit has been refunded after one year and if, anytime
thereafter, the consumer is late paying his or her water charges two
consecutive times, an additional water deposit of $150 will be required by the
city, to be held pursuant to the terms of this section.
   (D)   In the event that a water consumer’s account has not been an account
in good standing at any time during a period of five years or more from the
date of the original deposit, the deposit shall immediately be forfeited to the
city and the water consumer shall not be entitled to a refund.
   (E)   In the event that a water consumer’s account is inactive, no water
service is being provided in connection therewith and, after reasonable
attempts, the water consumer cannot be located, the deposit shall immediately
be forfeited to the city, and the water consumer shall not be entitled to a
refund.

   (A)   Existing single-family dwelling unit. All single-family dwelling
rental units that have individual meters and curb stops shall be billed
directly to the tenant/resident upon the owner’s request. However, the owner/
landlord is responsible for the collection of the water and sewer deposit fee
and is ultimately responsible for payment of the water and sewer bill. In the
event that the owner/landlord does not pay a delinquent water and sewer bill,
the city shall have the right to place a lien upon the property or pursue any
other remedy available.
   (B)   Existing multi-family dwelling units. Owners/landlords will be
responsible for the payment of the water and sewer base fee and water and sewer

the right to place a lien upon the property or pursue any other remedy
available.
   (C)   Existing duplexes. All existing duplexes that have individual meters
and curb stops for each unit shall be billed directly to the tenant(s) upon the
owner’s/landlord’s request or to the resident owner. In any case, the owner/
landlord is responsible for payment of the deposit fee for each rental unit and
ultimately responsible for the payment of the basic water/sewer fee and water
usage fee for each rental unit. In the event that the owner/landlord does not
pay a delinquent water and sewer bill, the city shall have the right to place a
lien upon the property or pursue any other remedy available.
   (D)   Existing townhome rental units. All existing townhome rental units
that have their own water meters and curb stops shall be billed directly to the
tenant(s) upon request of the owners/landlords. In any case, each owner/
landlord is responsible for the payment of the deposit fee and ultimately
responsible for the payment of the basic water/sewer fee and water usage fee.
In the event that the owner/landlord does not pay a delinquent water and sewer
bill, the city shall have the right to place a lien upon the property or pursue
any other remedy available.
(Prior Code, § 6-211)
§ 52.096 SPECIAL WATER MAIN EXTENSION FEE.
   (A)   The customer, upon approval of his or her application for water
service, shall pay to the City Water Department, if required, a special water
main extension fee. The fee shall only be charged to customers seeking to
connect to the municipal water system in areas whose property was not charged,
by way of special assessments, for the benefit of the water extension made in
that district.
   (B)   The amount of the special water main extension fee shall be based upon
the balance of the cost of construction of the water extension improvements not
assessed to other property and apportioned to the applicant according to the
area to be benefited by connection to the system. The entire amount of the
special water main extension fee shall be paid in full before a water
connection shall be approved.

   to OM&R expense)
Bn BOD concentration limit for surcharge, 200 mg/l
Bu OM&R costs to treat per unit of BOD, $0.089 per pound
Ri Concentration of additional substance discharged from user during billing
   period, mg/l
   Additional substance concentration limit for surcharge, 0 mg/l (this will be
Rn established upon the introduction of any additional substance to the plant
   influent)
   OM&R cost to treat per unit of any additional substance adding to expense to
Ru operate treatment works, $0/lb. (this will be established upon the
   introduction of any additional substance to the plant influent)
SC High-strength waste surcharge, $/billing period

plat.
   (E)   (1)   The city may consider an alternate method of determining the
sewage processing capital facilities charges for commercial and industrial
properties which exceed five acres in size, and where the sewer demand and
impact on the city’s infrastructure is not commensurate with large land areas
needed for the commercial or industrial entity to function. Examples of large
area requirements would include storage of raw and finished materials or
staging of transportation loading and unloading activities. The alternate
calculation would be based on water meter sizing and size of sewer main taps to
serve the entity.
      (2)   The alternate charge system would be as follows:
         (a)   Capital facility charge.
Meter Size Charge
Meter Size      Charge
5/8-inch        $1,300
3/4-inch        $1,950
1-inch          $3,250
1-1/2-inch      $6,500
2-inch disc     $10,400
2-inch turbo    $20,800
3-inch compound $20,800
3-inch turbo    $45,500
 
         (b)   Connection tap charge.
 
Meter Size   Charge
Up to 4-inch $1,400
6-inch       $1,600
8-inch       $1,800
 
         (c)   Notes.
            1.   The above charges would apply to each building where sanitary
sewer wastes are generated.
            2.   The minimum capital facility charge would be $19,000 (i.e.,
five acres at $3,600 per acre).
         (d)   Alternative method. The use of the alternative method of
determining sewage processing facilities charges is not an elective of the
commercial or industrial property and is reserved solely for the use by the
city if needed. The implementation of the alternative method and the sizing of
meters and connections to sewer mains will be determined by the City Engineer
and City Council.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 131.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Gang activity, criminal mischief and juvenile delinquency have become
an increasing reality of life within the city. Such activity exposes the
community to criminal conduct, lessens the citizens’ sense of safety and well-
being and generally erodes the quality of life our citizens have the right to
expect and enjoy. The activities of youths aged 18 and under can and should be
controlled by their parents and/or legal guardians. Unless such parental
responsibility is encouraged and ultimately exercised, criminal activity and
incidents of juvenile mischief will continue unabated.
   (B)   By reason of the foregoing facts, it is the recommendation of the
Mayor that the powers delegated by this section are urgently required for the
general welfare, health, safety and security of the city and the citizens
thereof.
(Prior Code, § 2-701)

section, a parent or legal guardian of any person under the age of 18 years

   A parent or guardian may appeal the civil penalty provided for herein by
filing a written notice with the City Council within 20 calendar days of the
date upon which the parent or guardian receives notice of such civil penalty. A
hearing shall be held, for which the City Council shall establish the
procedures. Said procedures shall contain requirements for providing the parent
or guardian with notice of the hearing and an appropriate time for preparation
for the same and shall not be inconsistent with any of the terms set forth in
this section.
(Prior Code, § 2-705)
§ 131.05 ANNUAL REPORTS BY MAYOR.
   The Mayor shall be responsible for providing a written report to the City
Council on or about one year from the date this section is approved and adopted
by the City Council. The report prepared pursuant to this section shall
include, but not necessarily be limited to: the number of individuals the Mayor
has determined to be in violation of this section; the nature of penalties
invoked for each such violation; the opinion of the Mayor regarding the
effectiveness of the various forms of civil penalties and alternate penalties
in encouraging parental responsibility; and any observation or improvements in

order of the Building Inspector has been made. The City Council shall hear all
appeals and shall have the power and authority, when appealed to, to modify the

SALE AND ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY; PUBLIC WORKS
§ 153.025 SALE AND CONVEYANCE; REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (G) below, the power of the city to
convey any real property owned by it, including land used for park purposes and
public squares, except real property used in the operation of public utilities,
shall be exercised by resolution, directing the sale at public auction or by
sealed bid of that property and the manner and terms of such sales, except that
the property shall not be sold at public auction or by sealed bid when:
      (1)   The property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of
federal or state grants or programs;
      (2)   The property is being conveyed to another public agency; or
      (3)   The property consists of streets and alleys.
   (B)   The City Council may establish a minimum price for real property at
which bidding shall begin or shall serve as a minimum for a sealed bid.
   (C)   After the passage of the resolution directing the sale, notice of all
proposed sales of property described in division (A) above and the terms of
such sales shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks in a
legal newspaper published in or of general circulation in the city.
   (D)   (1)   If within 30 days after the third publication of the notice a
remonstrance petition against the sale:
         (a)   Conforms to Neb. Rev. Stat. § 32-628;
         (b)   Is signed by registered voters of the city equal in number to
30% of the registered voters of the city voting at the last regular city
election held therein; and
         (c)   Is filed with the City Council, that property shall not then,
nor within one year thereafter, be sold. If the date for filing the petition
falls upon a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the signatures shall be
collected within the 30-day period, but the filing shall be considered timely
if filed or postmarked on or before the next business day.
      (2)   Upon the receipt of the remonstrance, the City Council, with the
aid and assistance of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk, shall
determine the validity and sufficiency of signatures on the petition. The City
Council shall deliver the petition to the Election Commissioner or County Clerk
by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials or by certified mail,
return receipt requested.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the petition, the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk shall issue to the City Council a written receipt that the petition is in
the custody of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk. The Election
Commissioner or County Clerk shall compare the signature of each person signing
the petition with the voter registration records to determine if each signer
was a registered voter on or before the date on which the petition was filed
with the City Council. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall also
compare the signer’s printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and
city or post office address with the voter registration records to determine
whether the signer was a registered voter. The signature and address shall be
presumed to be valid only if the Election Commissioner or County Clerk
determines that the printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and
city or post office address match the registration records and that the
registration was received on or before the date on which the petition was filed
with the City Council. The determinations of the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk may be rebutted by any credible evidence which the City Council
finds sufficient. The express purpose of the comparison of names and addresses
with the voter registration records, in addition to helping to determine the
validity of the petition, the sufficiency of the petition and the
qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent fraud, deception and
misrepresentation in the petition process.
      (4)   Upon completion of the comparison of names and addresses with the
voter registration records, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
prepare in writing a certification under seal setting forth the name and
address of each signer found not to be a registered voter and the signature
page number and line number where the name is found, and if the reason for the
invalidity of the signature or address is other than the nonregistration of the
signer, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall set forth the reason
for the invalidity of the signature. If the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk determines that a signer has affixed his or her signature more than once
to the remonstrance and that only one person is registered by that name, the
Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in writing a certification
under seal setting forth the name of the duplicate signature and shall count
only the earliest dated signature.
      (5)   The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall certify to the City
Council the number of valid signatures necessary to constitute a valid
remonstrance. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall deliver the
remonstrance and the certifications to the City Council within 40 days after
the receipt of the remonstrance from the City Council. The delivery shall be by
hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials or by certified mail, return
receipt requested. Not more than 20 signatures on one signature page shall be
counted.
      (6)   The City Council shall, within 30 days after the receipt of the
remonstrance and certifications from the Election Commissioner or County Clerk,
hold a public hearing to review the remonstrance and certifications and receive
testimony regarding them. The City Council shall, following the hearing, vote
on whether or not the remonstrance is valid and shall uphold the remonstrance
if sufficient valid signatures have been received.
   (E)   Real estate now owned or hereafter owned by the city may be conveyed
without consideration to the state for state armory sites or, if acquired for
state armory sites, shall be conveyed strictly in accordance with the
conditions of Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1001 through 18-1006.
   (F)   Following passage of the resolution directing a sale, publishing of
the notice of the proposed sale and passing of the 30-day right-of-remonstrance
period, the property shall then be sold. The sale shall be confirmed by passage
of an ordinance stating the name of the purchaser and terms of the sale.

resolution directing the sale of the property, notice of the sale shall be
posted in three prominent places within the city for a period of not less than
seven days prior to the sale of the property. The notice shall give a general

§ 153.061 VACATING PUBLIC WAYS; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      SPECIAL DAMAGES. Only those losses or damages or injuries which a
property owner suffers that are peculiar or special or unique to his or her
property and which result from the City Council vacating a street, avenue,
alley, lane or similar public way. SPECIAL DAMAGES shall not mean those losses
or damages or injuries that a property owner suffers that are in common with
the rest of the city or public at large, even though those losses or damages or
injuries suffered by the property owner are greater in degree than the rest of
the city or public at large.
   (B)   Whenever the City Council decides that it would be in the best
interests of the city to vacate a street, avenue, alley, lane or similar public
way, the City Council shall comply with the following procedure.
      (1)   Notice. Notice shall be given to all abutting property owners
either by first class mail to their last known address or if there is no known
address then by publishing the notice in a newspaper that is of general
circulation in the city. The content of the notice shall advise the abutting
property owners that the City Council will consider vacating that street,
avenue, alley, lane or similar public way at its next regular meeting, or, if a
special meeting is scheduled for the discussion, then the date, time and place
of that meeting.
      (2)   Consent; waiver. The City Council may have all the abutting
property owners sign a form stating that they consent to the action being taken
by the City Council and waive their right of access. The signing of this form
shall have no effect on claims for special damages by the abutting property
owners but shall create the presumption that the City Council’s action was
proper. If the abutting property owners do not sign the consent/waiver form,
the City Council may still proceed with vacating the street, avenue, alley,
lane or similar public way under the authority granted by Neb. Rev. Stat. §§
17-558 and 17-559.
      (3)   Ordinance. The City Council shall pass an ordinance that includes
essentially the following provisions:
         (a)   A declaration that the action is expedient for the public good
or in the best interests of the city;
         (b)   A statement that the city will have an easement for maintaining
all utilities; and
         (c)   A method or procedure for ascertaining special damages to
abutting property owners.
   (C)   The Mayor shall appoint three or five or seven disinterested residents
of the city to a special commission to ascertain the amount of special damages
that the abutting property owners are entitled to receive and which resulted
from the City Council vacating the street, avenue, alley, lane or similar
public way. The appointees of the special commission shall be approved by the
City Council. Only special damages shall be awarded to the abutting property
owners.
   (D)   In determining the amount of compensation to award the abutting
property owners as special damages, the commission shall use the following
rule: An abutting property owner is entitled to recover as compensation the
difference between the value of the property immediately before and immediately
after the vacating of the street, avenue, alley, lane or similar public way. If
no difference in value exists, the abutting property owner is entitled to no
compensation.
§ 153.062 CROSSINGS.
   The City Council may order and cause to be constructed, under the
supervision of the Street Superintendent, those street, avenue and alley
crossings as the City Council deems necessary. When a petition for the
construction of any such crossings is filed by an interested resident in the
office of the City Clerk, the City Clerk shall refer the application to the
Street Superintendent, who shall investigate and make a recommendation to the
City Council. Action by the City Council on the application, whether the
application is approved or rejected, shall be considered final.
§ 153.063 NAMES AND NUMBERS.
   The City Council may at any time by ordinance rename any street or provide a
name for any new street. Buildings used for residence or business purposes and
located along those streets shall retain those numbers as the City Council may
require. It shall be the duty of the Street Superintendent, upon the erection
of any new building, to assign the proper numbers to the building and give
notice to the owner and occupant of the same.
Penalty, see §
153.999
§ 153.064 PREMISES IDENTIFICATION.
   (A)   Each property owner shall maintain suitable numbers marking the
property’s street address, which shall be visible and legible from the street
or road fronting the property. This identification will help to improve
response times of police, fire and rescue by making it easier to find the right
location. The address numbers should contrast with their background and be a
minimum of four inches high and one-half inch wide.
   (B)   If the residence is located too far back from the street or road for
the address numbers to be readily seen, then the numbers must be:
      (1)   Larger;
      (2)   Posted in such a way that they can be read from the street or road;
      (3)   Posted at or near the edge of the street or road; or

Section 4.15   Nonconforming, General Intent
It is the intent of this ordinance to permit lawful non-conformities to
continue until they are removed, but not encourage their survival. Such uses
are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this ordinance that non-
conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district except as may be authorized in this title.
Section 4.16   Nonconforming Lots of Record
In any district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provision of this
ordinance, a primary structure and customary accessory buildings may be erected
on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of
this ordinance. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
the requirements for area or width, or both that are generally applicable in
the district provided that the yard dimensions and other requirements not
involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements
shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.
Section 4.17   Nonconforming Structures
4.17.01   Authority to continue: Any structure which is devoted to a use which
is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is
located on a lot which does not comply with the applicable lot size
requirements and/or the applicable bulk regulations, may be continued, so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions of this section.
4.17.02   Enlargement, Repair, Alterations: Any such structure described in
Section
4.17.01 may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled, provided, however,
that no such enlargement, maintenance, repair or remodeling shall either create
any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity
of all or any part of such structure, except that as to structures located on a
lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements, the side
yard requirements shall be in conformance with this section, and unless
otherwise permitted by conditional use permit unless otherwise approved or as
specified in the Residential District.
4.17.03   Damage or Destruction: In the event that any structure described in
Section
4.17.01 is damaged or destroyed, by any means other than intentional
destruction, to the extent of more than 60 percent of its structural value,
such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the zoning district in which it is located; provided that
structures located on a lot that does not comply with the applicable lot size
requirements in Section
4.16, shall not have a side yard of less than five feet. When a structure is
damaged to the extent of less than 60 percent of its structural value, no
repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained, and
restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial
destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
   Complete reconstruction of a nonconforming structure may be allowed through
a Conditional Use Permit if the structure is damaged or destroyed by natural
means and not through intentional destruction or actions of the property owner
or tenant. Reconstructed structures shall not be allowed to increase the level
of nonconformity with regard to setbacks or lot coverage.
4.17.04   Moving: No structure shall be moved in whole or in part for any
distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless
the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located after being moved.
Section 4.18   Nonconforming Uses
4.18.01   Nonconforming Uses of Land: Where at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made no
longer permissible under the terms of this ordinance as enacted or amended,
such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   1.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment or this ordinance.
   2.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
   3.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 12 consecutive months, any subsequent use of such land
shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district
in which such land is located.
   4.   Any use of land made nonconforming at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance wherein the development on the parcel of the land
was only partially completed, said development may be completed on said land so
long as the original parcel of land is not enlarged so as to encompass more
area than when the development was originally started.
(Ord. 813, passed 6-11-2024)
4.18.02   Nonconforming Uses of Structures: If a lawful use of a structure, or
of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
   1.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
   2.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
   3.   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structures and premises may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the board of adjustment either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the board of adjustment may require appropriate
conditions and safeguard in accord with the provisions of this ordinance;
   4.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district in which such structure is located and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
   5.   When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and premises in
combination is discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months, the
structure or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used
except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located;
   6.   Where nonconforming use status is applied to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
Section 4.19   Repairs and Maintenance
4.19.01   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use,
work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs or
on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing
provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of
passage of amendment of this ordinance shall not be increased.
4.19.02   Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety, upon order of such official.
Section 4.20   Uses under Conditional Use Permit Not Nonconforming Uses
Any use for which a special exception has been issued as provided in previous
ordinances shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further
action be deemed a conforming use in such district.
Section 4.21   Rear Yard Setbacks Reduction
The rear yard setback may be the lesser of the required setback in a district
or 20% of the depth of the lot.
Section 4.22   Side Yard Setbacks Reduction
The required side yard shall be maintained on each side of a dwelling, but may
be reduced to 10 percent of the lot width on lots of less than 60 feet in
width, provided, however, no side yard shall be less than five feet.
Section 4.23   Temporary Uses and Permits
4.23.01   This section provides regulations authorizing temporary uses. These
provisions are intended to permit occasional uses and activities of short
duration, when consistent with the objectives of this chapter and when

Section 5.02   Districts; Boundaries and Official Zoning Map
The boundaries of the districts are hereby established as shown on the map
entitled "Official Zoning Map of the City of Valley, Nebraska." Said maps and
all explanatory matter thereon accompany and are hereby made a part of this
Ordinance as if fully written herein. The Official Zoning District Map shall be
identified by the signature of the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk. No
changes shall be made on the Zoning District Map except as may be required by
amendments to this Ordinance. Such changes shall be promptly indicated on the
Zoning District Map with the Ordinance number, nature of change, and date of
change noted on the map.
Section 5.03   Rules for Interpretation of District Boundaries on the Official
Zoning Map
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   1.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines;
   2.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall
be construed as following such lot lines;
   3.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following City limits shall be
construed as following such City limits;
   4.   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to
be midway between the main tracks;
   5.   Boundaries indicated as following shore lines shall be construed to
follow such shore lines, and in the event of change in the shore line shall be
construed as moving with the actual shore line;
   6.   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streams, rivers, canals, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to
follow such center lines;
   7.   Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated
in subsections (1) to (6) above shall be so construed. Distances not
specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the
scale of the map;
   8.   Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at
variance with those shown on the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances
not covered by subsections (1) to (7) above, the Board of Adjustment shall
interpret the district boundaries;
   9.   Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single
ownership at the time of passage of this Ordinance, The Board of Zoning
Adjustment may permit the extension of the regulations for either portion of
the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the remaining
portion of the lot.
   10.   When a district boundary line splits a lot, tract, or parcel that is
in sole ownership, the zoning district with the most restrictive requirements
may be extended over the entire property without amending the zoning map
through the public hearing process.
   11.   When a lot, tract, or parcel is bisected by the extraterritorial
jurisdiction boundary line, the jurisdiction with the greatest portion of the
property shall have controlling interest.
Section 5.04   Land Use Categories Table Explanation
The Matrix found in Section
5.06 of this Ordinance is a listing of uses that may be allowed within the
variety of Zoning Districts.
   1.   The different uses are grouped into specific “Land Use Categories”.
   2.   The “Land Use Categories” are listed in each of the Zoning Districts in
lieu of specific uses. It is important to note, if a “Land Use Category” is
listed within a specific Zoning District, it DOES NOT indicate every use in the
“Land Use Category” is allowed within the specific District.
The different uses within Section
5.06 are Permitted (P), Allowed upon approval of a Conditional Use Permit (C),
Temporary (T) or not permitted (-).
In order to determine if a specific use is allowed in a Zoning District, the
following steps need to be followed:
   1.   Find the Use Type that matches your application
   2.   Look across the table and determine which of the Zoning Districts it
may be allowed.
   3.   Determine any special criteria for the use(s) by referring to the
specific District.
   4.   Determine where the specific Zoning Districts are by reviewing the
Official Zoning Map.
   5.   Determine the necessary procedures to receive required permits after
the land or property is the control of the applicant.
   6.   When doubt, please confer with Planning staff.
The Table in Section
5.06 also lists Accessory Uses which may be allowed or not allowed in any
specific Zoning District. The Accessory Use listing can be found at the end of
the Table.
Section 5.05   Annexation and Conformance with the Land Use Plan
Areas annexed into the corporate limits of Valley shall be zoned to conform to
the Future Land Use Plan.

Section 5.20   HO Highway Corridor Protection District (overlay district)
5.20.01   Intent:
The City of Valley has established basic site development criteria to be
implemented within the boundaries of this overlay district. These criteria
include, but are not limited to the following: landscaping, signing, lighting,
and interior street development. The motivation for regulating these issues is
to provide for a cohesive and properly developed entrance into the City of
Valley. Guiding development in this manner promotes the general health, safety
and welfare of the residents within the zoning jurisdiction of the City, by
providing quality design and construction, which will also aid in the
protection of past and future investment in the corridor.
5.20.02   Purpose:
The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those items that
affect the physical and aesthetic aspects of Valley’s community entrances.
Pertinent to appearance is the design of the site, planting, signs, street
hardware, and miscellaneous other objects that are observed by the public. The
uses allowed are governed by the underlying zoning district classification.
This Section provides additional criteria which shall be adhered to within the
HO overlay areas.
The criteria contained herein are not intended to restrict imagination,
innovation or variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles
that can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual
appearance of the entrances to the City, preserve taxable values, and promote
the public health, safety and welfare.
5.20.03   Geographic Area:
The Gateway Corridor Protection District extends generally along U.S. Highway
275 and portions of Nebraska Highway 64 within the one-mile extraterritorial
jurisdiction of Valley. The width of this district is as indicated on the
Official Zoning Map.
5.20.04   Criteria for Application:
All developments consisting of more than one principal building, mixed-uses,
multiple-pad development and/or similar shall be required to rezone the
property as a Clustered/Mixed Use Development (CMD) and meet the requirements
of said district. The CMD process and rezoning shall be in conjunction with
Preliminary and Final Plat review and approval.
5.20.05   Vehicular Circulation:
   1.   All development within the district shall have service roads. Highway
access shall be minimized.
   2.   The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition with the
streetscape and to provide for adequate planting, safe pedestrian movement, and
parking areas.
   3.   Parking areas and traffic ways shall be enhanced with landscaped spaces
containing trees or tree groupings.
5.20.06   Landscape and Site Treatment:
   1.   Landscape elements included in these criteria consist of all forms of
planting and vegetation, ground forms, rock groupings, water features, and all
visible construction except buildings and utilitarian structures.
   2.   Where natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to beauty and
utility of a development, they shall be preserved and developed. Modification
to topography will be permitted where it contributes to good site design and
development.
   3.   Plant material and Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of
certain plant varieties and other materials and by correlation with adjacent
developments.
   4.   Grades of walks, parking spaces, terraces, and other paved areas shall
provide an inviting and stable appearance for walking and, if seating is
provided, for sitting.
   5.   Landscape treatments shall be provided to enhance architectural
features, strengthen vistas and important axis, and provide shade.
   6.   The use of walls, fencing, planting, or combinations thereof shall be
used to screen service yards and other places that tend to detract from the
building features. Screening shall be equally effective in winter and summer.
   7.   Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building design and the
adjoining building and adjacent areas. Lighting shall be restrained in design
and excessive brightness avoided. Lighting shall be designed to a standard that
does not impact adjoining properties, especially residential areas.
   8.   Developments in the Highway Corridor Protection District shall meet all
other applicable screening regulations pursuant to
Article 7.
(Ord. 804, passed 12-12-2023)
5.20.07   Signs:
   A.   Every sign shall have good scale and proportion in its design and in
its visual relationship to buildings and surroundings.
   B.   Every sign shall be designed as an integral architectural element of
the building and site to which it principally relates.
   C.   The colors, materials, and lighting of every sign shall be restrained
and harmonious with the building and site to which it principally relates.
   D.   The number of graphic elements on a sign shall be held to the minimum
needed to convey the sign’s major message and shall be composed in proportion
to the area of the sign face.
   E.   Each sign shall be compatible with signs on adjoining premises and
shall not compete for attention.
   F.   Identification signs of prototype design and corporation logos shall
conform to the criteria for all other signs.
   G.   All signage shall comply with the Sign Regulations found in the
Supplemental Regulations, pursuant to
Article 8.

All conflicts between this Section and the landscaping and sign sections shall
be governed by the most restrictive regulation.
Section 5.21   Floodplain Regulations
5.21.01   Statutory Authorization
The Legislature of the State of Nebraska has delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the
public health, safety and general welfare. The Legislature of the State of
Nebraska has in Sections 31-1001 to 31-1022, R.R.S. 1943 assigned the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations designed to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
5.21.02   Findings of Fact
   1.   Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation
      The flood hazard areas of Valley, Nebraska, are subject to inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   2.   General Causes of the Flood Losses
      These flood losses are caused by: (1) The cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
(2) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected
from flood damages.
   3.   Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards
      This ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which
consists of a series of interrelated steps.
      a.   Selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected
frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The
base flood is selected for this ordinance. It is representative of large floods
which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the
particular streams subject to this ordinance. It is in the general order of a
flood which could be expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence
in any one year, as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood
Insurance Study 31055CV001E, 31055CV002E, 31055CV003E, and 31055CV004E dated
03/25/2025, as amended, and any future revisions thereto.
      b.   Calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic
engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas
to convey the base flood.
      c.   Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point.
      d.   Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the
floodway profile.
      e.   Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines, but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood.
(Ord. 835, passed 3-24-2025)
5.21.03   Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize those losses described in Section
5.21.02 (1) by applying the provisions of this ordinance to:
   1.   Restrict or prohibit uses, which are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or
velocities.
   2.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities,
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
construction.
   3.   Protect individuals from buying lands, which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazard.
   4.   Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program.
5.21.04   General Provisions
   1.   Lands to which ordinance applies
      This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the
City of Valley, Nebraska identified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
31055C0135H, 31055C0145H, 31055C0153H, 31055C0161H, 31055C0165H dated December
2, 2005; 31055C0154J, 31055C0155J, 31055C0160J, 31055C0162J dated May 19, 2014;
31055C0170L dated March 25, 2025, and any revisions thereto, as numbered and
unnumbered A Zones (including AE, AO and AH Zones) and within the Zoning
Districts FW and FF established in Sections 5.21.05 of this ordinance. In all
areas covered by this ordinance no development shall be permitted except upon
the issuance of a floodplain permit to develop, granted by the governing body
or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as
the governing body or the designated representative may reasonably impose for
the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health of the inhabitants
of the community and where specifically noted in Sections 5.21.06 through
5.21.08.
   2.   Enforcement Officer
      The Building Inspector of the community is hereby designated as the
community's duly designated Enforcement Officer under this Ordinance.
   3.   Rules for interpretation of district boundaries
      The boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall
be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map or Floodway Map. Where interpretation is needed to the exact
location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning
map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions, the Enforcement Officer shall make the
necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested,
the Board of Adjustment will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood
elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating
the district boundary on the land. The person contesting the location of the
district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case
to the Board of Adjustment and to submit his own technical evidence, if he so
desires.
   4.   Compliance
      Within identified special flood hazard areas of this community, no
development shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered
without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable
regulations.
   5.   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
      It is not intended by this ordinance to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existent easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this ordinance shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
   6.   Interpretation
      In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance
shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of
any other powers granted by state statutes.
   7.   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
      The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height
may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This ordinance does not imply that areas outside
floodway and flood fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within
such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage. This ordinance shall
not create liability on the part of Building Inspector of the City of Valley,
Nebraska or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may
result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
   8.   Severability
      If any section, clause, provision or portion of this ordinance is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
   9.   Appeal
      Where a request for a permit to develop or a variance is denied by the
Building Inspector the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly
to the Board of Adjustment.
(Ord. 835, passed 3-24-2025)
5.21.05   Development Permit
   1.   Permit Required
      No person, firm or corporation shall initiate any floodplain development
or substantial improvement or cause the same to be done without first obtaining
a separate permit for development as defined in Section
5.21.14.
   2.   Administration
      The Building Inspector is hereby appointed to administer and implement
the provisions of this ordinance.
   3.   Duties of the Building Inspector shall include, but not be limited to:

necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, state or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.
      C.   Notify adjacent communities and the Nebraska Natural Resources
Commission prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      D.   Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not
diminished.
      E.   Verify, record and maintain record of the actual elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
or substantially improved structures in special flood hazard areas.
      F.   Verify, record and maintain record of the actual elevation (in
relation to mean sea level) to which new or substantially improved structures
have been floodproofed.
      G.   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure the
Building Inspector shall be presented certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect.
   4.   Application for Permit
      To obtain a floodplain development permit, the applicant shall first file
an application in writing on a form furnished for that purpose. Every such
application shall:
   A.   Identify and describe the development to be covered by the floodplain

5.21.06   Establishment of Zoning Districts
Along watercourses where a floodway has been established, the mapped floodplain
areas are hereby divided into the two following districts:
   1.   A floodway overlay district (FW) and
   2.   A flood fringe overlay district (FF) as identified in the Flood
Insurance Study.
Within these districts all uses not meeting the standards of this ordinance and
those standards of the underlying zoning district shall be prohibited. These
zones shall be consistent with the numbered and unnumbered “A” zones as
identified on the official “FIRM” when identified in the Flood Insurance Study
provided by the Federal Insurance Administration.
5.21.07   Standards for Floodplain Development
   1.   No permit for development shall be granted for new construction,
substantial improvements and other development(s) including the placement of
manufactured homes within all numbered and unnumbered A zones (including AE,
AO, and AH zones) unless the conditions of this Section are satisfied.
   2.   All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to
inundation of the base flood; however, the water surface Section 5.21.08. If
Flood Insurance Study data is not available, the community shall utilize any
base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal, State
or other sources.
   3.   Until a floodway has been designated, no development or substantial
improvement may be permitted within special flood hazard areas unless the
applicant has demonstrated that the proposed development or substantial
improvement, when combined with all other existing and reasonably anticipated
developments or substantial improvements, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any location as shown on
the Flood Insurance Study.
   4.   New construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements,
prefabricated buildings, placement of manufactured homes and other developments
shall require:
      A.   Design and anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy.
      B.   New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage
systems be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site
waste disposal systems be located so as to avoid impairment or contamination.
      C.   Construction with materials resistant to flood damage, utilizing
methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and with electrical,
heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other
service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
      D.   All utility and sanitary facilities to be elevated or floodproofed
up to the regulatory flood protection elevation.

5.21.08   Flood Fringe Overlay District – Including AO and AH Zones)
   1.   Permitted Uses
      Any use permitted in Section 5.18.0 9 shall be permitted in the Flood
Fringe Overlay District. No use shall be permitted in the district unless the
standards of Section
5.18.07 are met.
   2.   Standards for the Flood Fringe Overlay District
      A.   Require new construction or substantial improvements of residential
structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above
one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
      B.   Require new construction or substantial improvements of non-
residential structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
to or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to be floodproofed so that below
that level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards
of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the
Building Inspector as set forth in Section
5.21.05(3)(G).
      C.   Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that

      I.   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in
Section
5.21.04 (1) are areas designated as AO Zones. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable
and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply within AO Zones:
         1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as one (1) foot above the depth number
specified in feet on the community's FIRM or, if no depth number is specified
on the FIRM, at least as high as three (3) feet.
         2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
            a.   Have the lowest floor elevated above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as one (1) foot above the depth number specified in feet
on the community's FIRM or, if no depth number is specified on the FIRM, at
least as high as three (3) feet.
            b.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that
level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Such certification
shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 5.21.05(3)(G).
Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required in order
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

5.21.09 Floodway Overlay District
   1.   Permitted Uses
      Only uses having a low flood-damage potential and not obstructing flood
flows shall be permitted within the Floodway District to the extent that they
are not prohibited by any other ordinance. The following are recommended uses
for the Floodway District:
      A.   Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, nurseries,
forestry.
      B.   Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking and play areas.
      C.   Non-residential areas such as loading areas, parking and airport
landing strips.
      D.   Public and private recreational uses such as golf courses, archery
ranges, picnic grounds, parks, wildlife and nature preserves.
New structures for human habitation are prohibited. All encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
development must be prohibited unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that the
development shall not result in any increase in water surface elevations along
the floodway profile during occurrence of the base flood discharge. These uses
are subject to the standards of Section
5.21.07 and
5.21.08. In Zone A unnumbered, obtain, review and reasonably utilize any flood
elevation and floodway data available through Federal, State, or other sources
or Section
5.21.07 (6)(D) of this Ordinance in meeting the standards of this Section.
5.21.10   Variance Procedures
   1.   The Board of Adjustment as established by City of Valley, Nebraska
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements
of this ordinance.
   2.   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Building Inspector in the enforcement or administration of this
ordinance.
   3.   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment or any
taxpayer may appeal such decision to the District Court as provided in Section
19-912, R.R.S. 1943.
   4.   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider all technical evaluation, all relevant factors, standards specified in
other sections of this ordinance, and:
      A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      E.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      F.   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and,
      K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
   5.   Conditions for Variances
      A.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items (5.21.10 (5)(B)-(F) below) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      B.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
      C.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels along the floodway profile during the base flood
discharge would result.
      D.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      E.   Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      F.   The applicant shall be given a written notice over the signature of
a community official that (1) the issuance of a variance to construct a
structure below the base flood level will result in increased premiums rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance
coverage and (2) such construction below the base flood level increases risks
to life and property.
Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions
as required by this ordinance.
5.21.11   Non-Conforming Uses
A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the
passage or amendment of the ordinance, but which is not in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance may be continued subject to the following
conditions:
      1.   If such use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future
use of the building premises shall conform to this ordinance. The Utility
Department shall notify the Building Inspector in writing of instances of
nonconforming uses where utility services have been discontinued for a period
of 12 consecutive months.
      2.   Uses or adjuncts thereof that are or become nuisances shall not be
entitled to continue as nonconforming uses.
      3.   If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means,
including flood, it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred except
that if it is reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this
ordinance. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration to
comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes
or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places,
provided that the alteration shall not preclude its continued designation.
5.21.12   Penalties for Violation
Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any of
its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with grants of variances or special exceptions) shall constitute
a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than
$100.00 and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case.
Each day such violation continues it shall be considered a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Valley, Nebraska or other
appropriate authority from taking such other lawful action is as necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation.
5.21.13   Amendments
The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this ordinance may
from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any
and all changes in the National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973,
provided, however, that no such action may be taken until after a public
hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens shall
have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Valley.
At least 15 days shall elapse between the date of this publication and the
public hearing. A copy of such amendments will be provided to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The regulations of this ordinance are in
compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations as published
in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the 1983 Nebraska Flood
Plain Management Act.

including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
"Existing Construction"  means (for the purposes of determining rates)
structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective
date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRM's effective before that
date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures."
"Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision"  means a manufactured home
park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either

effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
"Expansion to an Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision" means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
"Flood" or "Flooding"    means a general and temporary condition of partial or

watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than one foot.
"Freeboard"  means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate

analogous structure or matter which may impede, retard, or change the direction
of the flow of water, either in itself or by catching or collecting debris
carried by such water, or that is placed where the natural flow of the water
would carry such structure or matter downstream to the damage or detriment of
either life or property. Dams designed to store or divert water are not
obstructions if permission for the construction thereof is obtained from the
Department of Natural Resources pursuant to the Safety of Dams and Reservoirs
Act (Nebraska Revised Statutes 46-1601 to 46-1670 as amended).
"Overlay District"  is a district in which additional requirements act in
conjunction with the underlying zoning district(s). The original zoning
district designation does not change.
"Post-FIRM Structure" means a building that was constructed or substantially
improved after December 31, 1974 or on or after the community's initial Flood
Insurance Rate Map dated March 18th, 1980, whichever is later.

"Regulatory Flood Elevation" means the base flood elevation (BFE) plus a
freeboard factor as specified in this ordinance.
"Special Flood Hazard Area"   is the land in the floodplain within a community
subject to one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
"Start of Construction"  [for other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)] includes
substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a

the damage occurred.
"Substantial Improvement"  means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This includes structures which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either (1) any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions,
or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure."
"Variances"  is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
"Violation" means a failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the Elevation Certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
"Water Surface Elevation" means the height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal and

Article 7: Parking Requirements
Section 7.01   Purpose
The Off-Street Parking Regulations require developments provide parking in
proportion to the need created by each use. The regulations further establish
standards for the functional design of parking facilities. These regulations
are intended to accommodate vehicles in a functionally satisfactory manner and
to minimize external effects on neighboring properties.
Section 7.02   Off-Street Automobile Storage
7.02.01   Off-street automobile storage or standing space shall be provided on
any lot on which any of the uses or similar uses found in Section
7.03.
7.02.02   Off-street automobile storage or standing space shall be provided
with vehicular access to a street or an alley.
7.02.03   For purposes of computing the number of parking spaces available in a
given area, the ratio of 250 square feet per parking space shall be used.
7.02.04   Where calculations in accordance with the foregoing list results in
requiring a fractional space, any fraction less than one-half shall be
disregarded and any fraction of one-half or more shall require one space.
7.02.05   All parking spaces for single-family, two-family, and multi-family
dwellings, rooming and boarding houses, convalescent homes, and mobile homes
shall be either paved with asphalt or concrete.
7.02.06   In Districts R-1, R-2, and R-3 required off-street parking for
residential uses shall be provided on the lot on which the use is located.
7.02.07   In all other Districts, if the vehicle storage space or standing
space required in section
7.03 cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use
is conducted in the opinion of the Planning Commission and City Council, the
City Council may permit such space to be provided on another off-street
property, provided such space lies within 300 feet of an entrance to such
principal use. Such vehicle standing space shall be deemed to be required open
space associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or
encroached upon in any manner.
7.02.08   Where off-street parking is located on a lot other than the lot
occupied by the use, which requires it, site plan approval for both lots is
required.
7.02.09   All parking lots shall be hard-surfaced as defined herein.
7.02.10   Some uses may require two different use types to be calculated
together in order to determine the total parking requirement, i.e. primary
schools may require one a calculation for classrooms and another for assembly
areas.
7.02.11   The parking requirements herein do not apply to the C-2 Central
Business District.
7.02.12   All off-street parking conditions shall meet the ADA requirements in
Section
7.05 of this Ordinance.

curb and gutter and/or incorporate approved bio-filtration methods. Parking
spaces shall be defined with painted striping or other approved methods.
7.02.14   Off-street parking shall be located to the rear and/or side of
buildings, when practical. When parking or parking access must be located in
the front yard, a landscaped buffer shall be provided.
7.02.15   Parking bays in excess of 11 spaces in length shall provide
landscaping at the ends of each aisle in accordance with Section
12.04.05.
7.02.16   Parking bays in excess of 20 spaces in length shall be divided by
intermediate landscaped islands, and provide landscaping at the ends of each
aisle.
7.02.17   Where perpendicular parking spaces are used, the space adjacent to
the closed end of an aisle shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide.
7.02.18   An adequate driveway throat length shall be provided to minimize
traffic conflicts; the driveway throat length shall be the distance between the
street and the parking lot served by a driveway. Parking spaces shall not be
permitted within the driveway throat. Driveway throat lengths for commercial
and industrial uses shall be determined by the City Engineer.
7.02.19   Parking lots which will be developed in phases require a phasing plan
to identify all current and future parking lot requirements. Parking areas

the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the
crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to
the principal structure on the lot, parcel, or tract of land, whichever is
lower. When a sign is placed on a berm, the height of the sign shall include

equal but not exceed six tenths (0.6) grains per cubic foot as corrected to a
temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
   3.   Due to the fact that the possibilities of air contamination cannot
reasonably be comprehensively covered in this section, there shall be applied
the general rule that there shall not be discharged from any sources whatsoever
such quantities of air contaminants or other material in such quantity as to
cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any considerable number of
persons or to the public in general; or to endanger the comfort, repose,
health, or safety of any such considerable number of persons or to the public
in general, or to cause, or have a natural tendency to cause injury or damage
to business, vegetation, or property.
   4.   Odor: The emission of odors that are generally agreed to be obnoxious
to any considerable numbers of persons, shall be prohibited. Observations of
odor shall be made at the property line of the establishment causing the odor.
As a guide to classification of odor it shall be deemed that strong odors of
putrefaction and fermentation tend to be obnoxious and that such odors as
associated with baking or the roasting of nuts and coffee shall not normally be
considered obnoxious within the meaning of this Regulations.
   5.   Gasses: The gasses sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide shall not
exceed five parts per million (5ppm), carbon monoxide shall not exceed five
parts per million (5ppm). All measurements shall be taken at the zoning lot
line.

   the City Council finds:
      a.   Adult establishments, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and
lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
      b.   Adult establishments should be separated from sensitive land uses to
minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be
separated from other adult establishments, to minimize the secondary effects
associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of adult
establishments in one area.
   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which
the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating.
Additionally, the City’s interest in regulating adult establishments extends to
preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult
establishments that may locate in the City. The City finds that the cases and
documentation relied on in this resolution are reasonably believed to be
relevant to said secondary effects.
   The City Council hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings
and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of adult
establishments, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such
secondary effects.

Section 9.23   Solar Farms:
9.23.01 Applicability
The purpose of this subsection is to provide standards tor fixed-panel
photovoltaic solar farms consisting of ground-mounted solar panels that capture
energy from the sun and convert it to electricity. The provisions of this
section are based on a ground-mounted photovoltaic facility using a rammed post
construction technique and panels that support the flow of rainwater between
each module and the growth of vegetation beneath the arrays and limiting the
impacts of stormwater runoff. The rammed post construction technique allows for
minimal disturbance to the existing ground and grading of the site. Based on
the assumed solar farm design, Valley finds the use to be low intensity with
minimal trip generation, low amounts of impervious cover, and low emission thus
the use is compatible in non-urbanized, low-density areas with other
agricultural and scattered industrial uses.
9.23.01 Definitions
The following definitions pertain specifically to this section of the
Resolution.
Solar Access: A property owner's right to have sunlight shine on his land.
Solar Collector : An assembly, structure, or design, including passive
elements, used for gathering, concentrating or absorbing direct or indirect
solar energy, specifically designed for holding a substantial amount of useful
thermal energy and to transfer that energy to a gas, solid or liquid or to use
that energy directly; this may include, but is not limited to, a mechanism or
process used for gathering solar energy through thermal gradients, or a
component used to transfer thermal energy to a gas, solid or liquid or to
convert into electricity.
Solar Energy : Radiant energy received from the sun at wavelengths suitable for
heat transfer, photosynthetic use, or photovoltaic use.
Solar Energy System: A system that uses the power of the sun to capture and
store energy and reduce on site consumption of utility power.
Solar Energy System, Freestanding: A solar energy system that is not attached
to another structure and is ground mounted.
Solar Energy System, Joint: A solar energy collector or storage mechanism that
supplies energy for structures or processes on more than one lot or in more
than one dwelling unit or leasehold, but not to the general public and involves
at least two owners or users.
Solar Skyspace: The maximum three-dimensional space extending from a solar
collector to all positions of the sun necessary for efficient use of the
collector.
   (A)   Where a solar energy system is used for heating purposes only, solar
skyspace shall mean the maximum three-dimensional space extending from a solar
energy collector to all positions of the sun between nine o'clock (9:00) A.M.
and three o'clock (3:00) P.M. local apparent time from September 22 through
March 22 of each year.
   (B)   Where a solar energy system is used for cooling purposes only, solar
skyspace shall mean the maximum three-dimensional space extending from a solar
collector to all positions of the sun between eight o'clock (8:00) A.M. and
four o'clock (4:00) P.M. local apparent time from March 23 through September 21
of each year.
Solar Skyspace Easement: A right, expressed as an easement, covenant,
condition, restriction or other property interest in any deed, will or other
instrument executed by or on behalf of any landowner or in any order of taking,
appropriate to protect the solar skyspace of a solar collector at a
particularly described location to forbid or limit any or all of the following
where detrimental to access to solar energy: structures on or above ground;
vegetation on or above ground; or other activities. Such right shall
specifically describe a solar skyspace in three-dimensional terms in which the
activity, structures or vegetation are forbidden or limited or in which such an
easement shall set performance criteria for adequate collections of solar
energy at a particular location.
Solar Storage Mechanism: Equipment or elements such as piping and transfer
mechanisms, containers, heat exchangers or controls thereof and gases, solids,
liquids or combinations thereof that are utilized for storing solar energy,
gathered by a solar collector, for subsequent use.

Article 10: Gated Communities
The City of Valley recognizes that there is a market demand for subdivision
communities having limited access through the utilization of entryway gates.
The City of Valley recognizes that Gated Communities may be appropriate in
certain locations and in certain limited circumstances. The City of Valley
Zoning Regulations provided that Gated Communities are permitted uses in R-1,
R-2, and R-3 Zoning Districts.
This Article applies to all subdivisions for which a Gated Community was
requested by a Subdivider, not by an existing Homeowners Association, and
approved by the Valley Planning Board and Valley City Council prior to
platting.
Section 10.01   Definitions
The following definitions are for the purpose of
Article 10 only:
DECLARATION:  Simultaneous with the recording of the Gated Community plat, the
subdivider must record in the public records of the City of Valley, Nebraska, a
document or documents (herein referred to as the “Declaration”), which shall
govern all platted lots with the Gated Community, shall impose requirements and
restrictions that run with the land, and shall address the responsibilities for
the ongoing maintenance and repair of the Gated Community infrastructure. The
terms of the Declaration shall be, to the City of Valley’s satisfaction,
legally sufficient and enforceable to accomplish its stated requirements and
restrictions.
GATED COMMUNITY:  A residential area containing more than four (4) lots in
which access to the subdivision streets is restricted by the use of a
guardhouse, gate, or electronic arm, to which residents may gain entry by using
electronic cards, identification stickers, codes, or remote-control devices.
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION (“HOA”):  A mandatory community association in which the
owners of all lots, blocks, and tracts in the Gated Community are required by
the terms of the Declaration to be members.
INFRASTRUCTURE:  Those roadways and other items which should otherwise be
dedicated to the use of the public and/or the City of Valley in a typical
subdivision but which are retained for private use by the HOA or owners of lots
in the Gated Community; however, infrastructure as used herein specifically
excludes private amenities including, but not limited to, entrance and exit
gates, walls, swimming pools, clubhouses, parks and other recreation areas.
PRIVATE STREET:  A street created within a Gated Community which is not
dedicated for public use and which is located on a lot or outlot owned by a
Homeowners Association.
SUBDIVIDER :  (i) any person, group, corporation, partnership, or other entity,
or any agency thereof, dividing or proposing to divide land so as to constitute
a Gated Community or (ii) the person or entity that is the original Declarant
which records the Declaration and/or plat for a Gated Community or (iii) the
person or entity that succeeds to the rights and liabilities of the person or
entity which is the original Declarant, or (iv) in the absence of a written
assignment of subdivider rights recorded in the public records of the City of
Valley, Nebraska, the person or entity that materially or substantially
exercises the rights and liabilities of the original Declarant including, but
not limited to controlling the Board of Directors of the Homeowners
Association.
Section 10.02   General Provisions
The use of gates as a means of limiting access by the public necessitates that
streets and drainage systems for a Gated Community be privately owned and
maintained. However, the public’s interest is served only if the Gated
Communities and the accompanying private streets and drainage systems are
allowed as a privilege, not a right, of the subdivider and subsequent property
owners, and only if the improvements within a Gated Community comply with the
minimum standards of the subdivision regulations and are maintained in a manner
consistent with the existing standards established for similar facilities
maintained by the City of Valley.
This article acts as a contract among the Subdivider, the HOA, and the City of
Valley, by which the City of Valley allows a Subdivider to create a Gated
Community and allows the Subdivider and the HOA to keep the subdivision as a
community with gates that restrict access, so long as the Subdivider and the
HOA substantially comply with the requirements of this article.

Section 10.11   Homeowners Association General Liability Policy
   1.   The Declaration shall require that the Homeowners Association carry a
general liability insurance policy insuring itself from liability for damages
related to or arising in connection with the streets, sidewalks, drainage
system, gate, and any other infrastructure.
   2.   The minimum amount of insurance required shall be $5,000,000.00.
   3.   The City of Valley shall be named as an additional insured on such
policy and the Homeowners Association shall, on at least an annual basis, or
upon request at any time, provide the City of Valley with a valid Certificate
of Insurance from an insurance company licensed and qualified to do business in
the State of Nebraska, evidencing such coverage.
Section 10.12   Gated Community Cost Disclosure Statement
   1.   No contract for the sale and purchase of a residential lot or home in a
Gated Community shall be effective until a Gated Community Cost Disclosure
Statement, in substantially the form of the Gated Community Cost Disclosure
Statement attached hereto as Exhibit “A”, has been provided to and executed by
such purchaser.
   2.   This Gated Community Cost Disclosure Statement shall be in conspicuous
type and shall be contained in a single document which shall be provided to the
purchaser separately from the contract for purchase and sale and other required
documents.
   3.   The Gated Community Cost Disclosure Statement type shall be deemed
conspicuous if it is all uppercase letters and typed in at least 12-point
typeface. In the case of sale and purchase of multiple lots to a single
purchaser in a Gated Community, execution of a single Gated Community Cost
Disclosure Statement, is sufficient, provided that all lots are listed on the
Gated Community Cost Disclosure Statement either by legal description or by
street address.
   4.   The deed conveying a residential lot or home to a purchaser, whether or
not the Grantor is the Subdivider or an owner subsequent to the Subdivider,
shall contain a representation that the Grantor provided a copy of the gated
Community Disclosure Statement to the Grantee.
   5.   The City of Valley shall have the right to file the Gated Community
Cost Disclosure Statement, or a summary thereof, against all the lots within
the gated community, either as a separate filing by the City or in conjunction
with the Declaration.
EXHIBIT “A”
If you are buying a lot or home in a Gated Community within the city limits of
the City of Valley, you should know these basic facts:
   1.   The City of Valley will not pay to maintain the streets, sidewalks, and
drainage systems and shall not permitted to remove storm debris in the Gated
Community because the streets, sidewalks, and drainage are private property and
the general public cannot access the Gated Community.
   2.   Although the cost of properly maintaining and repairing streets,
sidewalks, and drainage systems can be very high, only the owners of homes and
lots in this Gated Community will share these expenses. Tax dollars will not be
used.
   3.   Members of this Gated Community, through their mandatory HOA, must set
aside adequate reserves to pay for storm debris removal in the event of a
tornado, snowstorm, or other major storm event, to properly maintain, repair,
and replace the streets, sidewalks, and drainage system, and must have a
professional engineer regularly inspect the streets, sidewalks, and drainage
system and report what work is necessary to maintain and/or repair them.
   4.   The mandatory HOA is obligated to do the necessary repair work and the
members of the HOA are obligated to pay for the work through their assessments.
   5.   The HOA is also required to maintain liability insurance adequate to
pay claims for injuries and property damage arising on the private streets,
sidewalks, drainage areas, and other common areas in the Gated Community.
   6.   If the City of Valley determines that the Gated Community is not
meeting its obligations, it may revoke the Gated Community’s privilege to close
its gates so that the roads in the Gated Community become available for public
use.
I have read and understood the disclosures provided in this Gated Community
Cost Disclosure Statement prior to execution of a contract to purchase any lot
in the [   ] Gated Community.

Article 13: Board of Adjustment
Section 13.01   Members, Terms and Meetings
Pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §19-908 (R.R.S. 1997): The Board of Adjustment
shall consist of five regular members, plus one additional member designated as
an alternate who shall attend and serve only when one of the regular members is
unable to attend for any reason, each to be appointed for a term of three years
and removable for cause by the appointing authority upon written charges and
after public hearings. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any
member whose term becomes vacant. One member only of the Board of Adjustment
shall be appointed from the membership of the Planning Commission, and the loss
of membership on the Planning Commission by such member shall also result in
his or her immediate loss of membership on the Board of Adjustment and the
appointment of another Planning Commissioner to the Board of Adjustment. The
first vacancy occurring on the Board of Adjustment shall be filled by the
appointment of a person who resides in the extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction
of the City at such time as more than two hundred persons reside within such
area. Thereafter, at all times, at least one member of the Board of Adjustment
shall reside outside of the corporate boundaries of the City but within its
extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction. The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules
in accordance with the provisions of any ordinance adopted pursuant to sections
19-901 to 19-914. Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the
chairperson and at such other times as the board may determine. Such
chairperson, or in his or her absence the acting chairperson, may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the board shall
be open to the public. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing
the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote,
indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other
official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the
board and shall be a public record.
Section 13.02   Appeals to Board, Record of Appeal, Hearings and Stays
As provided in Neb. Rev. Stat. §19-909 (R.R.S. 1997): Appeals to the Board of
Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department,
board or bureau of the City affected by any decision of the administrative
officer. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by
the rules of the Board, by filing with the officer from whom appeal is taken
and with the Board of Adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds
thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to
the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to
the Board of Adjustment, after the notice of the appeal shall have been filed
with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in
his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may
be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record in application on
notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. The
Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties, in interest,
and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may
appear in person or by agent or attorney.
Section 13.03   Powers and Jurisdiction on Appeal
The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
   1.   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative
official or agency based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation
or any regulation relating to the location or soundness of structures; and
   2.   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance, requests for interpretation of any map, or for decisions upon other
special questions upon which the Board is authorized by this Ordinance to pass;
and
   3.   To grant variances, where by reason of exceptional narrowness,
shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of enactment
of this Ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property,
the strict application of any regulation under this Ordinance would result in
peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue
hardships upon the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an appeal
relating to the property, a variance from such strict application so as to
relieve such difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be granted without
substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing
the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.
No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds that:
   1.   The strict application of the Ordinance would produce undue hardship;
and
   2.   Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same
zoning district and the same vicinity; and
   3.   The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment
to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be changed by
the granting of the variance; and
   4.   The granting of such variance is based upon reasons of demonstrable and
exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of
convenience, profit or caprice. No variance shall be authorized unless the
Board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the
intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to
make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be
adopted as an amendment to this Ordinance.
      In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of
the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members
of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Ordinance
or to affect any variation in this Ordinance.
Section 13.04   Appeals to District Court
Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the
Board of Adjustment may appeal as provided by Neb. Rev. Stat. §19-912,
(R.R.S.1997).

deemed to have received approval pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §19-916
(R.R.S.1997).

Any plat, hereafter made, for each subdivision or each part thereof lying
within the jurisdiction of this ordinance, shall be prepared, presented for

shall apply to the subdivision of a lot, tract, or parcel of land into two or

Council, after report from the Planning Commission, may vary, modify, or waive
the requirements so that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured; provided, however, that: such, modifications or waiver will
not adversely affect the development, the character of which shall be in
conformance with recommended platting and development practices in the general
area of the proposed subdivision; will not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of the regulations; and, will not interfere with carrying
out the Comprehensive Development Plan of the Planning Area of the City. The
standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified by the
Governing Body after report by the Planning Commission in the case of a planned

ARTICLE 4: RESERVED
ARTICLE 5: DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 5.01   General
No subdivision shall be approved unless it is in conformance with the
requirements of these regulations and the Comprehensive Development Plan.
Before preliminary or final plat approval is given, the City may require the
subdivider to dedicate reserve sites for parks, playgrounds, open space,
schools, and other public land consistent with the Comprehensive Development
Plan, as determined by the City. Reservation of land for public acquisition
and/or use shall be for a period not to exceed three years from the date the
plat is officially recorded unless otherwise provided for in the subdivision
agreement. If such reserved site is not acquired by the City or other
governmental entity within said three year period, the subdivider may then re-
subdivide the site for alternative purposes and sell any or all of the site.
In certain situations, the contemplated use of land creates or contributes to
the public need for land or facilities including but not limited to
recreational and public safety facilities created by the nature of the
development and use of land. In such situations, City may require dedication
and/or other appropriate designation by the subdivider.
Where a park, playground, school, or other site for public use indicated in the
Comprehensive Development Plan is located in whole or in part in the
applicant's subdivision the City will determine the density and location of
said park(s) and may require the immediate acquisition, reservation or accept
the dedication of such area.
Land which the Planning Commission has found to be unsuitable for subdividing,
due to flooding, poor drainage, steep slopes, rock formation, or other features
likely to be harmful to the safety, welfare or health of the future residents,
shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods for subdivision are formulated
by the developer and approved by the Planning Commission that would eliminate
or substantially reduce such hazards.
The Planning Commission may require all contiguous land under common ownership
to be submitted with the Preliminary Plat in order to evaluate overall
development patterns and conformity with the Comprehensive Development Plan and
issue proper extension of future roads and services.
Section 5.02   Streets
The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to the Comprehensive Development Plan and shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to
public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of land to be serviced by such streets. All streets shall meet
applicable AASHTO design standards, minimum design standards set by the
Nebraska Board of Public Roads Classification and Standards and in conformance
with City of Valley design standards. See Section
5.30 Schedule A: Minimum Street Standards.
The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall provide for the
continuation or appropriate projection of streets and alleys already existing
in areas adjacent to the area being subdivided. Where, at the determination of
the City Engineer, it is desirable to provide street access to adjoining
properties, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries
of the subdivision. Where the City Engineer deems it necessary with a written
recommendation for approval, such dead-end streets shall be provided with a
temporary turnaround having a right-of-way radius of at least 60 feet and a
paved radius of 44 feet, or other approved design.
Concrete curb and gutters shall be required for all streets within the
boundaries of the subdivision.
Section 5.03   Dedication of Rights-of-Way for New Streets
The dedications of rights-of-way for new streets measured from lot line to lot
line shall be shown on the plat and shall meet the right-of-way requirements as
stated in Section
5.30 of this Ordinance.
Where a subdivision fronts on an arterial street, the City Engineer shall,
where possible, require frontage roads. Where lots back up to an arterial
street and such lots have access by means other than the arterial street, a
frontage road may not be required.
Section 5.04   Dedication of Rights-of-Way for Existing Streets
Subdivisions platted along existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-
way or easements if necessary to meet the minimum street width requirements set
forth in this Ordinance. The entire minimum right-of-way width shall be
dedicated where the subdivision is on both sides of an existing street. When
the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one half of
the required right-of-way width, measured from the centerline of the existing
roadway, shall be dedicated along with any proposed easements. Dedication of
one-half of the right-of-way for a proposed street along the boundaries of land
proposed for subdivision shall be prohibited except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision and where it is practical and
reasonable to require the dedication of the other half of the right-of-way when
adjoining property is subdivided.
Section 5.05   Frontage Roads
Where a front or side yard abuts railroad, limited access freeway, or principal
highway or arterial street rights-of-way, a marginal access street or frontage
road may be required parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such rights-of-
way when necessary for adequate protection of properties from the arterial
street and to protect and preserve the safety and traffic handling capabilities
of the arterial street. The distance from said rights-of-way shall be
determined, with due consideration to minimum distance required for approach
connections to future grade-separated intersections. In the case of lots where
the rear yard is adjacent to an arterial street and such lots have access other
than off the arterial street frontage, a frontage road may not be required.
Section 5.06   Intersections
Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at an angle of 90 degrees, and no
intersection shall be constructed at an angle of less than 60 degrees. Street
curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least 20 feet. Larger
intersection radii may be required in industrial or commercial area or when
directed by the City Engineer. When the smallest angle of street intersection
is less than 75 degrees, the City Engineer may require curb radii of greater
length.
Access onto any street intersecting an arterial street shall be located no
closer to the right-of-way of such arterial street than 75 feet, or more at the
discretion of the City Engineer.
Consideration shall be given to street and right-of-way widths such that
minimum sidewalk requirements are maintained.
Section 5.07   Curves in Streets; Horizontal and Vertical
A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reversed
curves on arterial and collector streets.
Where there is a deflection angle of more than 10 degrees in the horizontal
alignment of a street, a curve shall be installed with a radius adequate to
ensure safe sight distances. Minimum requirements shall conform to the
standards in Section
5.30 of this Ordinance.
Minimum sight distances shall meet applicable AASHTO standards and shall
conform to the minimum design standards set by the Nebraska Board of Public
Roads Classifications and Standards.
Section 5.08   Street Grades and Elevations
All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of surface
water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by grading and drainage. The
minimum street grade shall not be less than three tenths of one percent (0.3%).
Minimum grades for gutters and ditches shall be three tenths and seven tenths
of one percent (0.3% and 0.7%), respectively. The City may allow lesser slopes
if approved by the City Engineer. Fill may be used in areas subject to flooding
in order to elevate streets and building pads provided such fill will not
increase flood elevations more than one foot in a floodplain and zero increase
in a floodway. Street grades shall conform to the maximum requirements provided
in Schedule A of this Ordinance.
Section 5.09   Access Control
In the interest of public safety and for the preservation of the traffic-
carrying capacity of the street system, the Planning Commission and City
Council shall have the right to restrict and regulate points of access to all
property from the public street system. Such restrictions shall be indicated on
the Final Plat.
Section 5.10   Access / Egress
There shall be a minimum of two vehicular access points per platted
subdivision, unless the City Engineer deems it necessary with a written
recommendation for approval to the City Council. The City Engineer shall
determine the most suitable location for said access points during the review
period.
Section 5.11   Street Jogs
Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 150 feet at intersections
shall be prohibited.
Section 5.12   Cul-de-sac Streets
Cul-de-sacs shall not be longer than 500 feet and shall provide a turnaround
bulb at the end of the stem portion of the street. The stem portion shall have
a 28-foot street width and a 60-foot right-of-way. The bulb portion shall have
a radius at the outside of the pavement of at least 44 feet and a radius at the
right-of-way of at least 60 feet. Alternative designs for temporary turnarounds
may be approved by the City Engineer. Cul-de-sac street lengths shall be
measured from the center of the cul-de-sac bulb to the nearest right-of-way
line of the intersecting street.
Temporary cul-de-sacs shall be provided for streets which are platted to be
extended in the future into adjoining property. Temporary cul-de-sacs shall
have a turnaround bulb with the radius at the outside of the pavement of at
least 44 feet.
Section 5.13   Terminal Roundabout Streets
Cul-de-sacs longer than 500 feet shall become terminal roundabout streets,
allowing for the full two lane street width to continue to circle around the
terminal bulb and return to the stem portion of the street. Terminal roundabout
streets shall have a 28-foot street width (both stem and roundabout). The
right-of-way of the street stem shall be 60 feet radius. The Terminal
Roundabout bulb shall have a minimum 66-foot radius center landscaped green
space. The centerline radius of the pavement shall be at least 80 feet. The
radius of the right-of-way shall be at least 110 feet.
Section 5.14   Design Standards; Boulevards.
Boulevards shall have 20 foot lane widths on each side of the boulevard median,
with a 12 foot median width, 8 foot landscaped space between the back of curb
and sidewalk, a 5 foot sidewalk, and 1 foot space to the lot line. The total
right-of-way width would be 80 feet. Cul-de-sacs located at the end of a
boulevard are pursuant to Section
5.30 Schedule A: Minimum Street Standards.
Section 5.15   Street Names
Proposed streets, which are in alignment with other existing streets, shall
bear the name of such other existing streets. All proposed names of all streets
shall be approved by Douglas County and the City Council prior to such names
being assigned or used.
Section 5.16   Private Streets and Reserve Strips
New private streets may be created as part of a gated community or a planned
development district provided such streets are specifically authorized by the
Planning Commission and City Council as an exception to the terms of the
Ordinance. There shall be no reserve strips in a subdivision except where their
control is definitely vested in the municipality under conditions of approval
by the Planning Commission as authorized in these regulations.
Section 5.17   Alleys
Alleys may be required in commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Dead-
end alleys shall be avoided, however, where a dead-end alley cannot be avoided,
a dead-end alley shall be provided with adequate turnaround capacity at the
dead-end. Alleys should be avoided in residential areas except where an
existing alley of an adjoining subdivision would dead-end at the boundary of
the proposed subdivision. Paved surfaces of Alleys shall be constructed of
Portland Cement Concrete.
Section 5.18   Water Lines and Hydrants (Fire Protection)
Fire protection shall be provided to all lots within a subdivision. All water
mains within a subdivision shall be a minimum of six inches in diameter, and
shall be sized and designed by the City Engineer. All water mains shall be
looped, unless a dead-end is approved by the City Engineer. Hydrant spacing and
layout shall not exceed 400 feet and shall be determined by the City Engineer.
Section 5.19   Water Mains and Sewer Mains (Location)
Except for good cause, all water mains and sewer mains shall be located within
the street right-of-way.
Section 5.20   Sidewalks
All sidewalks within a subdivision shall be of Portland cement concrete, a
minimum pavement width of five feet and shall be located one foot into the
street right-of-way adjacent to the residential lot line. No sidewalks are
required within Rural Residential RS zoning district.
Section 5.21   Trail Sidewalks / Walkways
All trail sidewalks required in addition to sidewalks within a subdivision
shall have a minimum pavement width of eight feet and be in conformance with
the City of Valley Trail System Masterplan.
Section 5.22   Blocks
In determining the lengths, widths and shapes of blocks, consideration shall be
given to the provision of adequate access and circulation, the suitability of
building sites to the needs of the use contemplated, and the zoning
requirements regarding minimum lot sizes, widths and frontages of the
anticipated zoning district. Except in unusual circumstances approved by the
City, block lengths shall not exceed 600 feet. Pedestrian easements 10 feet
wide shall be provided through or near the center of blocks more than 600 feet
long in order to provide for adequate pedestrian circulation.
Section 5.23   Lots
The size, width, depth, shape and orientation of lots shall conform to the
regulations of the applicable zoning district for the type of development and
use contemplated. All lots shall be developed such that surface drainage is
diverted to lot lines and not across adjacent properties. Corner lots for
residential uses shall be designed with adequate width to permit appropriate
building setback distances and orientation to both streets. The subdividing of
land shall be such as to provide each lot with satisfactory vehicular access
from a public street or an approved private street. Side lot lines shall be
designed as close as possible to be perpendicular to street right-of-way lines
or radial to cul-de-sac center points.
Section 5.24   Double Fronted Lots
Double fronted lots shall be avoided and will only be considered by the City in
unusual situations.
Section 5.25   Easements
Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided
for utilities where necessary and shall be 20 feet in width. When located on a
lot line, said easement shall be centered so that there is 10 feet of easement
on each side of lot line. In those zoning districts that require five feet side
yard setbacks, the required easement shall require the side yard setback to be
increased to 10 feet to permit the full 20 foot utility easement.
Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, a storm water drainage
easement substantially following the width of such water course shall be
provided. The width of the easement shall be adequate for maintenance purposes,
and shall be determined by the City Engineer as part of the Preliminary Plat.
Perpetual easements shall be granted to the power company, gas company,
telecommunications company, or cable company to install, operate, maintain,
repair or renew utilities. The easements shall be 5 feet in width along the
front, rear, and side boundary lot lines of all lots. A 16 foot wide easement
shall be provided at the rear of all exterior (outer perimeter) lots within a
subdivision. No permanent buildings or retaining walls shall be placed in said
easement ways, but the same may be used for gardens, shrubs, and landscaping.
Section 5.26   Storm Sewer System
Provisions shall be made to limit the peak rate of storm water discharge from
the subdivision. Post development runoff shall not exceed pre-development
runoff by more than ten percent, based upon a 10-year storm event.. Pre-
development shall be the condition prior to improvements being completed. In
determining the size or type of the storm sewer system to be used, the design
shall be sufficient to handle all computed runoff from the proposed
development. For large drainage areas, natural drainage ways shall be
maintained, and the City may require cross drainage structures such as
culverts, bridges, etc. No downstream impacts, caused by the new development,
shall be allowed.
Section 5.27   Sanitary Sewer System
Design of all sanitary sewer systems shall be performed by the City Engineer.
Design standards shall conform to the Nebraska Department of Environmental
Quality (NDEQ). The minimum size of public sewer mains shall be 8 inches and

Section 5.28   Flood Hazards
Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable for
residential or other development shall not be platted for such purposes. Such
land may be set aside on the plat for such uses compatible with the hazards
associated with flooding or erosion. All development shall be flood proof in
accordance with the flood hazard zoning provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including
manufactured home parks, are required to assure that
   a.   all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage,
   b.   all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical,
and water systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or
eliminate them receiving flood damage,
   c.   adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards, and
   d.   Proposals for development (including proposals for manufactured home
parks and subdivisions) of five (5) acres or fifty (50) lots, whichever is
lesser, shall include within such proposals the base flood elevation(s).
Section 5.29   Conformance with Other Regulations
No Final Plat of land within the City or its jurisdictional area shall be
approved unless it conforms with existing zoning regulations. Whenever there is
a conflict between the standards set forth in these regulations and those
contained in other regulations the highest standard shall govern.

1989. These standards are as follows:
   1.   The surveyor shall establish or confirm the prior establishment of
permanent monuments at each corner on the boundary lines of the parcel being
surveyed. Monuments shall be solid and substantially free from movement. In

surveyor may use monuments (i.e., nail and washer) that have a probability of
permanence. Where a corner or a line falls on or within a wall, column line or
other physical feature and the placement of a monument is not feasible, the
wall, column line or physical feature shall become the monument by reference
thereto.
