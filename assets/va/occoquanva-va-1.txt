§ 33.29 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers and duties:
   (A)   To hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision, or
determination made by an administrative officer in the administration or
enforcement of this subchapter or of Chapter 157 of this code;
   (B)   To authorize upon appeal or original application in specific cases
such variance as defined in VA Code § 15.2-2201, from the terms of Chapter 157
of this code as will not be contrary to the public interest, when, owing to
special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions will result in
unnecessary hardship; provided that the spirit of Chapter 157 of this code
shall be observed and substantial justice done, as follows:
      (1)   When a property owner can show that his or her property was
acquired in good faith and where by reason of the exceptional narrowness,
shallowness, size, or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the
effective date of Chapter 157 of this code, or where by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such
piece of property, or of the condition, situation, or development of property
immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of Chapter
157 of this code would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the
utilization of the property or where the Board is satisfied, upon the evidence
heard by it, that the granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly
demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special
privilege or convenience sought by the applicant, provided that all variances
shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of Chapter 157 of this
code;
      (2)   No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds
that:
         (a)   The strict application of
Chapter 157 of this code would produce undue hardship;
         (b)   Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the
same zoning district and the same vicinity; and
         (c)   The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not
be changed by the granting of the variance.
      (3)   No such variance shall be authorized except after notice and
hearing as required by VA Code § 15.2-2204. However, when giving any required
notice to the owners, their agents, or the occupants of abutting property and
property immediately across the street or road from the property affected, the
Board may give such notice by first-class mail rather than by registered or
certified mail;
      (4)   No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the
condition or situation of the property concerned is not of so general or
recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a
general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to Chapter 157 of this code;
and
      (5)   In authorizing a variance, the Board may impose such conditions
regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed structure
or use as it may deem necessary in the public interest, and may require a
guarantee or bond to ensure that the conditions imposed are being and will
continue to be complied with.
   (C)   To hear and decide appeals from the decision of the Zoning
Administrator after notice and hearing as provided by VA Code § 15.2-2204.
However, when giving any required notice to the owners, their agents, or the
occupants of abutting property and property immediately across the street or
road from the property affected, the Board may give such notice by first-class
mail rather than by registered or certified mail. No such appeal shall be heard
except after notice and hearing as provided by VA Code § 15.2-2204;
   (D)   To hear and decide applications for interpretation of the district map
where there is any uncertainty as to the location of a district boundary. After
notice to the owners of the property affected by any such question, and after
public hearing with notice as required by VA Code § 15.2-2204, the Board may
interpret the map in such way as to carry out the intent and purpose of Chapter
157 of this code for the particular section or district in question. However,
when giving any required notice to the owners, their agents, or the occupants
of abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from
the property affected, the Board may give such notice by first-class mail
rather than by registered or certified mail. The Board shall not have the power
to change substantially the locations of district boundaries as established by
ordinance. No provision of this section shall be construed as granting to the
Board the power to rezone property;
   (E)   To hear and decide applications for such special exceptions as may be
authorized in Chapter 157 of this code. The Board may impose such conditions
relating to the use provided for in the authorized special exceptions for which
a permit is granted as it may deem necessary in the public interest, including
limiting the duration of a permit, and may require a guarantee or bond to
ensure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied
with. No such special exception may be granted except after notice and hearing
as provided by VA Code § 15.2-2204. However, when giving any required notice to
the owners, their agents, or the occupants of abutting property and property
immediately across the street or road from the property affected, the Board may
give such notice by first-class mail rather than by registered or certified
mail; and
   (F)   To revoke a special exception if the Board determines that there has
not been compliance with the terms or conditions of the permit. No special
exception may be revoked except after notice and hearing as provided by VA Code
§ 15.2-2204. However, when giving any required notice to the owners, their
agents, or the occupants of abutting property and property immediately across
the street or road from the property affected, the Board may give such notice
by first-class mail rather than by registered or certified mail.
(1998 Code, § 2-280) (Ord. O-2023-15, passed 9-19-2023)
§ 33.30 APPEALS TO BOARD.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   An appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the town affected
by any decision of the Zoning Administrator or from any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by any other administrative officer (a
“decision”) in the administration or enforcement of VA Code §§ 15.2-2280 et
seq., or
Chapter 157 of this code. Except as provided in division (A)(2) below, any
decision shall include a statement informing the recipient that he or she may
have a right to appeal the notice of a zoning violation or a written order
within 30 days in accordance with this section, and that the decision shall be
final and unappealable if not appealed within 30 days. The appeal period shall
not commence until the statement is given.
      (2)   A notice of violation concerning a temporary trailer for sales and
construction office during construction, temporary seasonal displays, or
parking of a marked company vehicle in connection with a home occupancy
certificate shall state that the appeal must be brought to the Board of Zoning
Appeals (BZA) within ten days from the date of the decision.
   (B)   Application and fees. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning
Administrator may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) by filing, on the
form provided, a notice of appeal with the Zoning Administrator and the Board
of Zoning Appeals, which appeal shall specify the grounds of the appeal,
together with the fees as established in the current fee schedule. For a notice
of violation concerning a temporary trailer for sales and construction office
during construction under §
157.014; temporary seasonal displays under §§
157.041(A)(8),
157.061(A)(7),
157.081(A)(9),
157.101(A)(4), or
157.121(A)(21); or parking of a marked company vehicle in connection with a
home occupancy certificate under §
157.010, the appeal must be filed within ten days from the date of the notice
of violation. For all other decisions, the appeal must be filed within 30 days
from the date of the decision. The application and accompanying maps, plans,
and other documentation constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was taken shall be transmitted promptly to the Secretary of the Board, who
shall place the matter on the docket. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay
would in his or her opinion cause imminent peril to life or property, in which
case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order
granted by the Board or by a court of record, on application and on notice to
the Zoning Administrator and for good cause shown.
   (C)   Notice and hearing required; Planning Commission recommendation. After
entering the appeal on the docket, the Secretary of the Board shall advertise a
public hearing, give written notice to the parties in interest, and request the
Zoning Administrator to transmit a copy of the application and his or her staff
report to the Planning Commission; the Planning Commission may send a written
recommendation to the Board to appear as a party at the public hearing.
   (D)   Burden of proof. The applicant for a variance has the burden of
proving that denial of a variance will result in unnecessary hardship, of
proving that his or her hardship is due to
Chapter 157 of this code itself, and of proving, to the satisfaction of the
Board, requirements for a variance stipulated in the VA Code.
   (E)   Findings required. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of an application or appeal, give public notice as well as due notice
to the parties in interest, and make its decision within 90 days of the filing
of the application or appeal. In exercising its powers, the Board may reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify an order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from. The concurring vote of a majority of the
membership of the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
decision, or determination of an administrative officer or to decide in favor
of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under
Chapter 157 of this code or to effect any variance from
Chapter 157 of this code. The decision of the Board must be based on the
evidence adduced at a public hearing and must include findings of fact
disclosing the evidence relied upon by the Board and otherwise state the
business and grounds for its decision to assure that the provisions of the VA
Code and this subchapter have been met.
   (F)   Board to issue order. Whenever the Board shall grant a variance, the
Secretary of the Board shall cause an order to be issued evidencing the grant
and furnish copies of the order to the applicant, to the Zoning Administrator,
to the Town Clerk, and to such other parties as deemed necessary.
   (G)   Limitation on change. In no event shall a written order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Zoning Administrator or other
administrative officer be subject to change, modification, or reversal by any
Zoning Administrator or other administrative officer after 60 days have elapsed
from the date of the written order, requirement, decision, or determination
where the person aggrieved has materially changed his or her position in good
faith reliance on the action of the Zoning Administrator or other
administrative officer unless it is proven that such written order,
requirement, decision, or determination was obtained through malfeasance of the
Zoning Administrator or other administrative officer or through fraud. The 60-
day limitation period shall not apply in any case where, with the concurrence
of the Town Attorney, modification is required to correct clerical or other
nondiscretionary errors.

§ 33.31 JUDICIAL REVIEW AND RELIEF.
   (A)   Certiorari to review decision of Board. Any person aggrieved by any
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or any aggrieved taxpayer or any
officer, department, board, or bureau of the town may present to the Circuit
Court of the county a petition specifying the grounds on which aggrieved within
30 days after the filing of a decision in the office of the Board.
   (B)   Parties aggrieved entitled to writ. Upon the presentation of such
petition, the court shall allow a writ of certiorari to review the decision of
the Board and shall prescribe the time within which a return must be made and
served upon the relator’s attorney, which shall not be less than ten days and
may be extended by the court. The allowance of the writ shall not stay
proceedings upon the decision appealed from; but the court may, on application,
on notice to the Board, and on due cause shown, grant a restraining order.
   (C)   Other parties to suit. If the petition is presented by the Town
Council, the Council shall be party to the suit. The court may, likewise, admit
as a party to the suit any person who, if the decision had been adverse, would
have been authorized under this division (C) to present a petition in the first
instance.
   (D)   Board to make return. The Board shall not be required to return the
original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return
certified or sworn copies of the papers or of such portions of the papers as
may be called for by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other
facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision
appealed from and shall be verified.
   (E)   Costs not allowed. Costs shall not be allowed against the Board unless
it shall appear to the court that the Board acted in bad faith or with malice
in making the decision appealed from.

sells or uses cigarettes within the town an excise tax at a rate of $0.40 per
pack or $0.02 cents per each cigarette sold. The effective date of the tax is

Virginia Cigarette Tax Board pursuant to a joint exercise of powers agreement
authorized by VA Code § 58.1-3832 (as amended) and executed by the town in

of the NVCTB shall be as set forth in §

   (C)   The tax imposed by this section is cumulative with the cigarette tax
imposed by the County of Prince William so that both the town and the county

§ 35.102 METHODS OF COLLECTION; STAMPS.
   (A)   The tax imposed by this article shall be evidenced by the use of a
stamp and shall be paid by each dealer or other person liable for the tax under
a reporting method deemed by the NVCTB to carry out the provisions of this
article. The stamps shall be affixed in such a manner that their removal will
require continued application of water or steam. Each dealer or other person
liable for the tax is hereby required, and it shall be his or her duty, to
collect and pay the tax and report all packages of cigarettes on forms
prescribed for this purpose by the NVCTB:
      (1)   The quantity of NVCTB stamped cigarettes sold or delivered to:
         (a)   Each registered agent appointed by the NVCTB for which no tax
was collected;
         (b)   Each manufacturer's representative; and
         (c)   Each separate person and place of business within the town
during the preceding calendar or fiscal month;
      (2)   The quantity of NVCTB stamps on hand, both affixed and unaffixed,
on the first and last day of the preceding calendar month and the quantity of
NVCTB stamps or NVCTB stamped cigarettes received during the preceding calendar
month;
      (3)   The quantity of cigarettes on hand to which the NVCTB stamp has not
been affixed on the first and last day of the preceding calendar month and the
quantity of cigarettes received during the preceding calendar month to which
the NVCTB stamps had not been affixed; and
      (4)   Such further information as the Administrator for the NVCTB may
require for the proper administration and enforcement of this article for the
determination of the exact number of cigarettes in the possession of each
dealer or user.
   (B)   Each dealer or other person liable for the tax shall file such reports
with the NVCTB and pay the tax due to the NVCTB prior to the due date, and
shall furnish copies of all cigarette tax reports submitted to the Virginia
Department of Taxation.
   (C)   When, upon examination and audit of any invoices, records, books,
cancelled checks or other memoranda touching on the purchase, sale, receipt,
storage or possession of tobacco products taxed in this article, any dealer or
other person liable for the tax is unable to furnish evidence to the NVCTB of
sufficient tax payments and stamp purchases to cover cigarettes which were
sold, used, stored, received, purchased or possessed by him or her, the prima
facie presumption shall arise that such cigarettes were received, sold, used,
stored, purchased or possessed by him or her without the proper tax having been
paid. The NVCTB shall, from the results of such examination and audit based
upon such direct or indirect information available, assess the tax due and
unpaid and impose a penalty of 10% and may impose interest of three-quarters
percent per month of the gross tax due.
   (D)   When any dealer or other person liable for the tax files a false or
fraudulent report or fails to file a report or fails to perform any act or
performs any act to evade payment of the tax, the NVCTB shall administratively
assess the tax due and unpaid and impose a penalty not to exceed 50% of the tax
due and interest of three-quarters percent per month of the gross tax due.
   (E)   The dealer or other person liable for the tax shall be notified by
certified mail of such deficiency and such tax, penalty and interest assessed
shall be due and payable within ten days after notice of such deficiency has
been issued. Every dealer or other person liable for the tax shall examine each
package of cigarettes to ensure that the NVCTB stamp has been affixed thereto
prior to offering them for sale.
   (F)   Any dealer or other person liable for the tax who shall receive
cigarettes not bearing the NVCTB stamp shall, within one hour of receipt of
such cigarettes, commence and with all reasonable diligence continue to affix
the NVCTB stamp to each and every package of cigarettes until all unstamped
packages of cigarettes have been stamped and before offering such cigarettes
for sale. Any dealer or other person liable for the tax who has notified the
NVCTB that he or she is engaged in interstate or intrastate business shall be
permitted to set aside such part of his or her stock as may be legally kept for
the conduct of such interstate or intrastate business (that is, cigarettes held
for the sale outside the jurisdiction of the NVCTB) without affixing the stamps
required by this article. Any such interstate or intrastate stock shall be kept
entirely separate and apart from the NVCTB stamped stock, in such a manner as
to prevent the commingling of the interstate or intrastate stock with the NVCTB
stock. Any dealer or other person liable for the tax found to have untaxed
cigarettes which have been lost whether by negligence, theft or any other
unaccountable loss, shall be liable for and shall pay the tax due thereon.
   (G)   It shall also be the duty of each dealer or other person liable for
the tax, and he or she is hereby required, to maintain and keep for a period of
three years, not including the current calendar year, records of cigarettes
received, sold, stored, possessed, transferred or handled by him or her in any
manner whatsoever, whether the cigarettes were stamped or unstamped, to make
all such records available for audit, inspection and examination and to make
available, at all reasonable times, the means, facilities and opportunity for
making such audit, inspection or examination upon demand of the NVCTB.

§ 35.103 REGISTERED AGENTS.
   (A)   Any dealer or other person liable for the tax imposed by this article
who shall sell, use, store, possess, distribute or transport cigarettes within
or into the town shall first make application to the NVCTB to qualify as a
registered agent. Such application blank, which shall be supplied upon request,
shall require such information relative to the nature of the business engaged
in by the applicant as the NVCTB deems necessary for the administration and
enforcement of this article. There is a yearly registration fee for all
wholesale dealers and for all cigarette machine operators. Applicant shall
provide a surety bond to the NVCTB of 150% of his or her average monthly tax
liability with a surety company authorized to do business in the Commonwealth
of Virginia. Such bond shall be so written that, on timely payment of the
premium thereon, it shall continue in force from year to year. Any applicant
whose place of business is outside the town shall automatically, by filing his
or her application, submit himself or herself to the NVCTB's legal jurisdiction
and appoint the Administrator for the NVCTB as his or her agent for any service
of lawful process.
   (B)   Upon receipt of the properly completed required application forms, and
the required surety bond executed, the NVCTB shall determine whether the said
applicant qualifies to be a registered agent. The NVCTB will issue said
qualified applicant a yearly registered agent permit to qualify him or her to
purchase, sell, use, store, possess, distribute or transport within or into the
town NVCTB stamped cigarettes.
   (C)   Registered agents shall agree to the reporting and payment
requirements placed upon them by this article and the rules and regulations as
from time to time may be promulgated by the NVCTB. When any registered agent's
monthly report and payment of the tax is not received within the dates
prescribed, the NVCTB shall impose a late reporting penalty of 10% of the gross
tax due or $10, whichever is greater, but in no event more than $1,000. The
NVCTB may also require such registered agent to provide proof that he or she
has complied with all applicable laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia to
legally conduct such business and to file financial statements showing all
assets and liabilities. The NVCTB may revoke or suspend any registered agent's
permit due to failure to file tax reports in a timely manner, nonpayment of
taxes due or if the cigarette tax surety bond should become impaired for any
reason.

§ 35.104 REQUIREMENTS FOR RETAIL DEALERS.
   (A)   Retail dealers who shall sell, offer for sale, store, possess,
distribute, purchase, receive or transport cigarettes for the purpose of sale
within the town shall purchase cigarettes only from registered agents giving or
supplying business trade name and business address of the location where the
cigarettes will be placed for sale to the public. Cigarettes purchased for
personal use cannot be brought into a business for resale. Only properly
registered and licensed retail stores may sell cigarettes to the public. To be
properly registered and licensed, a retail store must first have a valid
Virginia state sales and use tax certificate and valid retail business license.
Cigarettes must be purchased and stored separately for each business location.
All copies of cigarette purchase invoices/receipts must be retained by the
retailer for a period of three years and shall be made available to agents of
the NVCTB upon request for use in conducting audits and investigations. All
copies of cigarette purchase invoices/receipts must be stored at the business
retail location for a period of one year from date of purchase. Failure to
provide cigarette invoices/receipts may result in confiscation of cigarettes
until receipts can be reviewed by the NVCTB to verify the proper tax has been
paid. It is the responsibility of each retail location to ensure that all
cigarettes placed for sale or stored at that location be properly taxed and
stamped. Cigarettes found without the NVCTB stamp or the proper jurisdictional
tax paid will be seized by the agents of the NVCTB.
   (B)   Retail dealers must make their place of business available for
inspection by tobacco revenue agents to ensure that all cigarettes are properly
stamped and all cigarettes taxes are properly paid.

§ 35.105 PRESUMPTION OF ILLEGALITY; SEIZURE OF CONTRABAND GOODS; SEALING/
SEIZING OF MACHINES.
   (A)   If any dealer, cigarette machine operator or other person liable for
the tax imposed by this article is found to possess any cigarettes without the
jurisdictional tax paid or the proper tax stamp affixed, there shall be a
rebuttable presumption that any such operator or other person shall be in
possession of untaxed cigarettes in violation of this article.
   (B)   If any cigarettes are placed in any vending machines within the town,
then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such cigarettes were placed
in that machine for sale within the town. If any vending machine located within
the town contains cigarettes upon which the NVCTB tax stamp has not been
affixed or on which the jurisdictional tax has not been paid or containing
cigarettes placed as so not to allow visual inspection of the NVCTB tax stamp
through the viewing area as provided for by the vending machine manufacturer,
then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the machine contains untaxed
cigarettes in violation of this article.
   (C)   Any cigarettes, vending machines, cigarette tax stamps or other
property found in violation of this article shall be declared contraband goods
and may be seized by the NVCTB. In addition to any tax due, the dealer or other
person liable for the tax possessing such untaxed cigarettes or tax stamps
shall be subject to civil and criminal penalties herein provided.
   (D)   In lieu of seizure, the NVCTB may seal such vending machines to
prevent continued illegal sale or removal of such cigarettes. The removal of
such seal from a vending machine by any unauthorized person shall be a
violation of this article. Nothing in this article shall prevent the seizure of
any vending machine at any time after it is sealed.
   (E)   All cigarette vending machines shall be plainly marked with the name,
address and telephone number of owner of said machine.

   (B)   Where holders of property interest in cigarettes, vending machines or
other property are known at time of seizure or sealing, notice of seizure or
sealing shall be sent to them by certified mail within 24 hours. Where such
holders of property interests are unknown at time of seizure or sealing, it
shall be sufficient notice to such unknown interest holders to post such notice
to a door or wall of the room or building which contained such seized or sealed
property. Any such notice of seizure or sealing shall include procedures for an
administrative hearing for return of such property seized or sealed, as well as
affirmative defenses set forth in this section which may be asserted.
   (C)   Such hearing shall be requested within ten days of the notice of such
assessment, seizure or sealing and shall set forth the reasons why the tax,
penalties and interest and cigarettes, vending machines or other property
should be returned or released. Within five days after receipt of such hearing
request, the Administrator shall notify the petitioner by certified mail of a
date and time for the informal presentation of evidence at a hearing to be held
within 15 days of the date notification is mailed. Any such request for hearing
shall be denied if the assessed tax, penalties and interest have not been paid
as required or if the request is received more than ten days from the first
notice to the petitioner of such seizure or sealing. Within five days after the
hearing, the Administrator shall notify the petitioner by registered mail
whether his or her request for a correction has been granted or refused.
   (D)   Appropriate relief shall be given by the Administrator if he or she is
convinced by the preponderance of the evidence that such seized cigarettes were
in the possession of a person other than the petitioner without the
petitioner's consent at the time such cigarettes, vending machines or other
property were seized or sealed or that the petitioner was authorized to possess
such untaxed cigarettes. If the Administrator is satisfied that the tax was
erroneously assessed, he or she shall refund the amount erroneously assessed
together with any interest and penalties paid thereon and shall return any
cigarettes, vending machines or other property seized or sealed to the
petitioner. Any petitioner who is dissatisfied with the written decision of the
NVCTB may within 30 days of the date of such decision appeal such decision to
the appropriate court in the jurisdiction where the seizure or sealing
occurred.

the remainder of this section shall not be affected or impaired by such
judgment, decision, or order of any court of competent jurisdiction and shall
be interpreted, if necessary, so as to give a meaning consistent with the

dangerous conditions as provided in this division (B).
      (1)   The owners of property in the town shall, at such time or times as
the Council may prescribe, remove therefrom any and all trash, garbage, refuse,
litter, and other substances which might endanger the health or safety of other
residents of the town. The town may, whenever the Council deems it necessary,
after reasonable notice, have such trash, garbage, refuse, litter, and other
like substances which might endanger the health of other residents of the town,
removed by its own agents or employees, in which event the cost or expenses
thereof shall be chargeable to and paid by the owners of such property and may
be collected by the town as taxes are collected. Any tree, bush, or other plant
which endangers persons or poses a risk of fire or other property damage
because of its location and/or condition shall constitute a substance which
might endanger the health or safety of residents of the town for purposes of
this division (B).
      (2)   Every charge authorized by this division (B) or VA Code § 15.2-900
with which the owner of any such property has been assessed and that remains
unpaid shall constitute a lien against such property ranking on a parity with
liens for unpaid local taxes and enforceable in the same manner as provided in
VA Code Title 58.1, Chapter 39, Articles 3 (§§ 58.1-3940 et seq.) and 4 (§§
58.1-3965 et seq.). The Town Council may by resolution waive such liens in
order to facilitate the sale of the property. Such liens may be waived only as
to a purchaser who is unrelated by blood or marriage to the owner and who has
no business association with the owner. All such liens shall remain a personal
obligation of the owner of the property at the time the liens were imposed.
   (C)   In addition to any other remedies provided by this code or the VA
Code, the town may protect public health, safety, and welfare by addressing
dangerous structures as provided in this division (C).
      (1)   The owners of property in the town shall remove, repair, or secure
any building, wall or any other structure that might endanger the public health
or safety of other residents of the town at such time or times as the Town
Council may prescribe by resolution or ordinance.
      (2)   The town through its agents or employees may remove, repair, or
secure any building, wall, or any other structure that might endanger the
public health or safety of other residents of the town, if the owner and lien
holder of such property have failed to remove, repair, or secure the building,
wall, or other structure, after the notice provided in this division (C) has
been sent and the time to act provided in that notice has elapsed.
         (a)   For purposes of this division (C), repair may include
maintenance work to the exterior of a building to prevent deterioration of the
building or adjacent buildings.
         (b)   For purposes of this division (C), reasonable notice includes a
written notice: mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, sent to the last known address of the property owner; and published
once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation
in the locality.
         (c)   No action shall be taken to remove, repair, or secure any
building, wall, or other structure for at least 30 days following the later of
the return of the receipt or newspaper publication, except that the town may
take action to prevent unauthorized access to the building within seven days of
such notice if the structure is deemed to pose a significant threat to public
safety and such fact is stated in the notice.
      (3)   If the town, through its own agents or employees, removes, repairs,
or secures any building, wall, or any other structure after complying with the
notice provisions of this division (C) or as otherwise permitted under the
Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code in the event of an emergency, the cost
or expenses thereof shall be chargeable to and paid by the owners of such
property and may be collected by the town as taxes are collected.
      (4)   Every charge authorized by this division (C) or VA Code § 15.2-900
with which the owner of any such property has been assessed and that remains
unpaid shall constitute a lien against such property ranking on a parity with
liens for unpaid local real estate taxes and enforceable in the same manner as
provided in VA Code Title 58.1, Chapter 39, Articles 3 (§§ 58.1-3940 et seq.)
and 4 (§§ 58.1-3965 et seq.). The Town Council may, by resolution, waive such
liens in order to facilitate the sale of the property. Such liens may be waived
only as to a purchaser who is unrelated by blood or marriage to the owner and
who has no business association with the owner. All such liens shall remain a
personal obligation of the owner of the property at the time the liens were
imposed.
   (D)   In addition to any other remedies provided by this code or the VA
Code, the town may protect public health, safety, and welfare by addressing
dangerous wharves, piers, pilings, bulkheads, vessels, or abandoned,
obstructing, or hazardous property as provided in this division (D).
      (1)   The owners of property in the town shall, at such time or times as
the Town Council may prescribe, remove, repair, or secure any vessel which has
been abandoned or any wharf, pier, piling, bulkhead, or any other structure or
vessel which might endanger the public health or safety of other persons, or
which might constitute an obstruction or hazard to the lawful use of the waters
within or adjoining such locality. If such property is deemed to be abandoned,
the Town Council may designate and empower an official to ascertain the lawful
owner of such property and to have the owner repair, remove, or secure such
property.
      (2)   The town, through its own agents or employees, may remove, repair,
or secure any vessel which has been abandoned or any wharf, pier, piling,
bulkhead, or other structure or vessel which might endanger the public health
or safety of other persons or which might constitute a hazard or obstruction to
the lawful use of the waters within the town, if the owner of such property,
after reasonable notice and reasonable time to do so, has failed to remove,
repair, or secure such wharf, pier, piling, bulkhead, or other structure or
vessel.
      (3)   If the town, through its own agents or employees, removes, repairs,
or secures any wharf, pier, piling, bulkhead, or other structure or vessel
after complying with the notice provisions of this division (D), the cost or
expenses thereof shall be chargeable to and paid by the owners of such property
and to the extent applicable may be collected by the locality as taxes are
collected.
      (4)   If the identity or whereabouts of the lawful owner is unknown or
not able to be ascertained after a reasonable search and after lawful notice
has been made to the last known address of any known owner, the town, through
its own agents or employees, may repair such wharf, pier, piling, bulkhead, or
other structure or vessel or remove such property after giving notice by
publication once each week for two weeks in a newspaper of general circulation
in the area where such property is located.
      (5)   Every charge authorized by this division (D) with which the owner
of any such property has been assessed and which remains unpaid, to the extent
applicable, shall constitute a lien against the owner’s real property, and such
lien shall be recorded in the judgment lien docket book in the County Circuit
Court. Such lien may also be reduced to a personal judgment against the owner.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall affect the town’s ability to abate or
remove dangerous conditions pursuant to a declared national, state, or local
emergency.

Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper representation
of the noise source. The microphone during measurement shall be positioned so
as not to create any unnatural enhancement or diminution of the measured noise.
A windscreen for the microphone shall be used. A minimum of three sound level
readings will be taken. The geometric mean of these readings will be used as
the average sound level. If the background noise is equal to the levels set
forth in §
92.06, three dB shall be subtracted out of the average sound level.
   (B)   The slow meter response of the sound level meter shall be used to
determine that the average amplitude has not exceeded the dBA readings or the
limiting noise spectra set forth in §
92.14.
   (C)   Unless otherwise specified in this article, the measurement shall be
made at:
      (1)   The property boundary on which such noise is generated;
      (2)   Any point within the receiving property affected by the noise; or

   (A)   Town collected refuse.
      (1)   Storage. Except as otherwise permitted in writing by the Town
Manager or their designee, refuse shall be stored in a refuse container
provided by the town or in a sufficient number of watertight metal or non-
breakable containers, made of plastic or another durable material, equipped
with handles and tightfitting covers. The size and characteristics of
containers shall be subject to reasonable regulation by the Town Manager or
their designee, consistent with the town’s current contract for trash
collection. Containers and storage areas for refuse shall be emptied regularly
and cleaned sufficiently often to keep them free of obnoxious odors and vermin.
      (2)   Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the provisions of this
section:
         (a)   Tree trimmings with a maximum diameter of one and one-half
inches, bushes and brush must be tied securely in bundles not more than four
feet in length.
         (b)   Refuse collected during the spring cleanup that is too large or
bulky for containers may be placed next to the containers.
         (c)   Ashes shall only be disposed of when cold, and shall only be
placed in metal containers.
      (3)   Placement. All refuse for collection by town collectors shall be
placed at the curb line not earlier than 4:00 p.m. of the day preceding pickup
and not later than 6:00 a.m. on the day of pickup. Containers must be tightly
covered. Plastic bags must be securely tied. Refuse shall not be placed on the
sidewalk or on any portion of a street right-of-way where it will interfere
with pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Containers shall be removed from the curb
line as soon as possible after trash pickup and no later than 9:00 a.m. on the
day proceeding the day of pickup. When not placed at the curbline for pickup,
containers shall be stored in the rear of the building or in a screened or
enclosed trash receptacle storage area, subject to reasonable regulation set by
the Town Manager or their designee.
      (4)   Special and/or bulk collection. In the event a customer has a
special collection item that is too large, bulky or heavy to be handled in the
normal refuse curb-side collection, the customer must contact the town
collector to request a special collection at least 24 hours prior to their
regular collection day. Said special collection items shall be placed out for
collection in accordance with the requirements of this division (A)(3).
   (B)   Non-town collected refuse.
      (1)   When determined by the Town Manager, or designee, that a health
issue may exist due to the volume or material being placed out for collection
or due to code violations of the customer, the town may decline to provide
refuse collection services. In such event, the customer will be required to
secure separate refuse collection services and if the determination is for
volume install a dumpster.
      (2)   Each establishment required to use a dumpster as their storage
container(s) must ensure that they are vermin-proof and waterproof, constructed
of noncorrosive material and equipped with tight fitting lids which must be
kept closed at all times, except when filling or emptying the container. The
dumpster must be contained in the rear of the building or in a storage area,
placed in a location as approved by the Town Manager, or designee, to protect
the public health. Said dumpster must be emptied at least once per week unless
determined by the Town Manager, or designee, that more frequent collection is
advisable to protect the public health or to abate a public nuisance. The
property owner or business must contract for the dumpster and its associated
collections through a licensed solid waste hauler.
      (3)   Storage areas must remain fully accessible to collection equipment
and to public health inspection. These areas shall protect refuse from
dispersal by wind or otherwise, and must be kept free of litter and refuse
overflow.
   (C)   Recycling collection.
      (1)   All recyclable materials shall be separated from garbage, trash,
and refuse and shall be placed in a suitable container, stored, and placed at
curbside as set out in division (A) of this section. All recyclable materials
shall be clean, and all bottles and cans shall be rinsed before being placed in
the bin for pickup.
      (2)   Nothing in this Code shall prohibit any person from selling or
donating recyclable materials rather than putting them out for collection by
the town or non-town contractor.

violations arising from the same set of operative facts. The civil penalty for
subsequent violations not arising from the same set of operative facts within
12 months of the first violation shall be $200. Each business day during which
the same violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate
offense. In no event shall a series of specified violations arising from the
same set of operative facts result in civil penalties that exceed a total of
$3,000 in a 12-month period or, in the case of property that is zoned or
utilized for industrial or commercial purposes, $6,000 in a 12-month period.
      (2)   The imposition of civil penalties under §
92.01(B) shall be in lieu of criminal penalties and shall preclude prosecution
of such violation as a misdemeanor. However, such violations shall be a class 3
misdemeanor in the event three civil penalties have previously been imposed on
the same defendant for the same or similar violation, not arising from the same
set of operative facts, within a 24-month period. Classifying such subsequent
violations as criminal offenses shall preclude the imposition of civil
penalties for the same violation.
      (3)   The town may impose and collect civil penalties, not to exceed a
total of $1,000, for violations of §
92.01(C).
(1998 Code, § 30-1)

unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ORGANIZED PUBLIC GATHERING. Any gathering of persons, with or without
vehicles, in or on public areas or facilities for any activity as a group, and

(Ord. O-2025-01, passed 2-4-2025)
§ 93.02 OBSTRUCTION OF AND ENCROACHMENT ONTO PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY AND PROPERTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in this Code, no person shall cause or maintain an
obstruction of or encroachment over, under or in any street, highway, road,
alley, bridge, viaduct, subway, underpass or other public right-of-way or
place; provided that any person desiring to use any part of a public right-of-
way for the temporary purposes of building and construction may obtain a permit
from the town, which permit shall state the mode and character of the
obstruction and length of time it shall continue; and further provided that no
such permit shall be granted when such obstruction can be reasonably avoided.
   (B)   Any person building near the street line shall be required to erect
such overhead scaffolding as may be necessary to protect the public from
anything that may fall from the wall or scaffolding of such building.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Town Manager or their designee, when
approving such permit, to require the party obtaining the permit give such
assurance as may be necessary to protect the town from liability from any
damage that may result from such obstruction.
   (D)   The town may remove any unpermitted obstruction or encroachment and
charge the cost thereof to the owner or occupant of the property so obstructing
or encroaching, and may collect the cost in any manner provided by law for the
collection of Commonwealth or local taxes.
   (E)   Every person who desires to construct a building, fence, gate, porch,
steps, post, pole, door or other similar structure permanently encroaching on
any street or sidewalk in the town must secure a license to encroach from the
Town Council. The applicant shall have a certified land surveyor establish the
line of such street at the place where such improvement is intended to be
constructed and prepare an encroachment plat in accordance with applicable town
and Virginia Code. Such applicant shall not be required to remove any
improvement constructed in accordance with such permission. It shall be
unlawful for any person, without obtaining such permission, to construct any
such improvement in such manner as to encroach upon the street or sidewalk or
interfere with the grade thereof.
   (F)   No part of this section shall be construed to prevent businesses and
individuals from placing signage on streets and sidewalks that are otherwise in
compliance with the provisions of §§
157.300 through
157.321 of this Code of Ordinances.
(1998 Code, § 50-1) (Ord. O-2025-01, passed 2-4-2025)
§ 93.03 USE OF PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (A)   General requirement. Unless otherwise specifically provided by this
Code, other law, or applicable regulations created by the Town Manager or their
designee, no organized public gathering of either (1) 15 or more persons or (2)
that results in the closing of any public areas or facilities, shall be
conducted, allowed or maintained on or within public areas or facilities
without first obtaining a permit from the town.
   (B)   Authority to administer. The Town Manager or their designee is
delegated authority to administer this section and shall issue supplementary
rules and regulations, as deemed necessary, that are in support of and not in
conflict with the provisions of this section. Such supplemental rules and
regulations shall have the same force and effect as if fully set forth in this
section.
   (C)   Application and use guidelines. Except as provided in division (D) of
this section, an application for a permit with the application fee and
applicable additional fees shall be filed with the town ahead of any organized
public or private gathering as outlined in division (A) of this section. The
application process, the rules and regulations for use of the public area or
facility, and any fees for rental of public facilities, labor, and other costs
incurred by the town shall be set by the Town Manager or their designee, and
published for public reference.
   (D)   Standards for issuance. The standards which shall be considered in
determining whether a permit should be issued shall include, but not be limited
to, the following:
      (1)   Whether the proposed public meeting or parade will conflict with
one already scheduled.
      (2)   Whether the proposed public meeting or parade will seriously
obstruct the free flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      (3)   Whether the potential damage to public property and facilities will
be excessive because of the unusual or extraordinary character and/or
circumstances of the proposed public meeting or parade.
      (4)   The reasonableness of the hour of day or night the proposed public
meeting or parade will take place.
      (5)   Whether the proposed public meeting or parade will put undue
hardship upon available public sanitary facilities and trash disposal
facilities.
      (6)   It is intended that the parks be open to the general public at all
times; therefore, should the proposed public meeting or parade seriously hamper
or interfere with the general use, it may be denied.
      (7)   Where there is a reasonable threat of violence and/or public damage
resulting from the proposed public meeting or parade, the party requesting such
authorization shall provide the town with a written plan which reasonably sets
forth measures to adequately control and ensure against the anticipated
violence and/or property damage. The town may also request a surety bond to pay
for repairs caused by any damage. If the foregoing plans and/or bond is found
to be satisfactory to the Town Manager, the proposed authorization may be
granted.
      (8)   Whether the proposed meeting or parade will be conducted in
conformity with all applicable provisions of the state code, state law and town
ordinances, rules and regulations.
   (E)   Exceptions. The permit provisions of this section shall be optional
for:
      (1)   Activities by the U.S. government, Commonwealth of Virginia, or
Town of Occoquan, or any division, department, or agency thereof;
      (2)   Spontaneous gatherings;
      (3)   Funeral processions where law enforcement either provides traffic
control or determines that no traffic control is needed.
   (F)   Illegal activities. Nothing in this section or any permit issued under
it shall authorize a person to:
      (1)   Obstruct the entrance to any building, property, or vehicle, except
to the extent expressly permitted by a public safety plan;
      (2)   Cross police lines, perimeters or barricades set up pursuant to VA
Code § 15.2-1714;
      (3)   Trespass on private property in violation of VA Code § 18.2-119, or
on school property in violation of VA Code § 18.2-128;
      (4)   Obstruct the free passage of others in violation of VA Code § 18.2-
404, except to the extent expressly permitted by a public safety plan;
      (5)   Create an unlawful assembly or riot in violation of VA Code §§
18.2-405 or 18.2-406;
      (6)   Engage in disorderly conduct in violation of VA Code § 18.2-415;
      (7)   Engage in picketing that violates the National Labor Relations Act
or VA Code §§ 18.2-418, 18.2-419, 40.1-53, or 40.1-66;
      (8)   Violate the noise standards set out in §§
92.10 through
92.20 of this Code; or
      (9)   Otherwise violate applicable law.
   (G)   Abatement of hazards and obstructions. This division applies whether
there is a permit for the gathering or not and whether the gathering is
organized or not. If any gathering on public areas or facilities creates a
hazard to public safety or violates any provisions of this section, then the
town may require that the hazard or violation be promptly ended or that the
gathering move to the nearest location where the risk of harm will be
diminished to a reasonable level in light of the purposes of this article. Any
such direction shall be narrowly tailored to abate the risk of harm without
limiting the public gathering more than reasonably necessary. Failure to obey
such direction constitutes a violation of this section. A "hazard to public
safety" as used in this division includes any condition or action that:
      (1)   Creates a hazard or obstruction to pedestrians or traffic beyond
what is permitted by a public safety plan; or
      (2)   Damages public facilities.

manner directed and having not permitted the materials to remain there longer
than the limited period stipulated in the permit.

from such sidewalk within 12 hours after it has ceased falling; provided that,
if snow falls during the night, it shall be removed by 5:00 p.m. on the
following day. The same requirements shall exist with respect to ice or sleet
on sidewalks, except that ice and sleet, if it cannot be removed without injury
to the sidewalk, shall be covered within the time required in this section,
with sawdust, ashes, or other material which will render the sidewalk safe for
travel. When there is no occupant of such property, it shall be the duty of the
owner thereof to have such snow, ice, and sleet removed or covered as provided
in this section. If after such reasonable notice as the town may prescribe the
owner or occupant of the property affected by the provisions of this section
shall fail to abate or obviate the condition, the town may do so and charge and
collect the cost thereof from the owner or occupant of the property affected in
any manner provided by law for the collection of state or local taxes

   (B)   Address number requirements.
      (1)   Address numbers shall be assigned based on the location of the
driveway or point of access. Addresses on corner lots or lots which front on
more than one street shall be assigned on the street the driveway originates.
If the driveway accesses both streets, the address shall be assigned to the
street on which the building fronts.
      (2)   Street numbers shall be uniformly assigned, with numbers increasing
from north to south and east to west as shown on the parcel identification
maps. The directional orientation of a street shall be determined by the Town
Manager.
      (3)   Numbers on the north side of east-west streets shall be even, and
numbers on the south side of these streets shall be odd. Numbers on the west
side of north-south streets shall be even, and numbers on the east side of
these streets shall be odd.
      (4)   Numerical street segments (blocks) or building grouping is
encouraged within new developments. Such block numbering should attempt to
build off of existing addressing schemes where possible.
      (5)   On existing streets outside of new developments, numbers shall be
assigned based on their geographical location in relation to existing addresses
(e.g. a new address exactly between 100 and 140 should be 120).
      (6)   For townhomes, number assignment should be sequential along a row
of townhomes with a minimum increase of ten when assigning numbers to the next
row within the same block (e.g. First Row: 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111; Second
Row: 121, 123…).
      (7)   In cases where a building has a shared entrance for multiple
businesses or dwelling units, each separate apartment or suite shall be
designated by an approved suite number. Suite numbers should be sequential and
intuitive in layout and assignment. The use of odd and even assignments should
be considered in hallways as they are for streets. The first numeric shall be
indicative of the floor on which the business or dwelling unit is located (e.g.
Suite 201 is on the second floor, Suite 301 is on the third floor…). The
exclusive use of odd numbers in order to preserve room for future adjustments
of commercial suites should be considered when possible. Alphabetical letters
and/or half numbers shall not be used as suite numbers.
      (8)   Buildings with separate entrances leading to separate clusters of
apartments or suites shall be given separate addresses for each entrance.

nearest the street providing access to the building. Display of a street
address at the corner of an accessway shall be such that clear identification
can be made of the location of the building to which the address is assigned.
Such identification shall be clear and visible and able to be made from both
directions of travel on the roadway.

where such postings are in addition to the standard numeric posting required.
   (D)   The display of street address numbers for multiple dwelling units,
commercial and industrial buildings shall be solid numerals that are a minimum

such buildings.
   (E)   The owner of a principal building shall be responsible for posting the
building's assigned number and shall be responsible for the cost of such
posting.
   (F)   The Town Manager shall have the authority to grant special exceptions

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 111.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACTED RESPONSIBLY. The taxpayer: exercised the level of reasonable care that
a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the
filing obligations for the business; and undertook significant steps to avoid
or mitigate the failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where
applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment, acting to remove
an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure once the
impediment was removed or the failure discovered.
   AFFILIATED GROUP.
      (1)   One or more chains of corporations subject to inclusion connected
through stock ownership with a common parent corporation, which is a
corporation subject to inclusion if:
         (a)   Stock possessing at least 80% of the voting power of all classes
of stock and at least 80% of each class of the nonvoting stock of each of the
corporations subject to inclusion, except the common parent corporation, is
owned directly by one or more of the other corporations subject to inclusion;
and
         (b)   The common parent corporation directly owns stock possessing at
least 80% of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least 80% of each
class of the nonvoting stock of at least one of the other subject to inclusion
corporations. As used in this section, the term “stock” does not include
nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends; the term
CORPORATION SUBJECT TO INCLUSION means any corporation within the AFFILIATED
GROUP irrespective of the state or country of its incorporation; and the term
“receipts” includes gross receipts and gross income.
      (2)   Two or more corporations if five or fewer persons who are
individuals, estates, or trusts own stock possessing:

of stock entitled to vote or at least 80% of the total value of shares of all
classes of the stock of each corporation; and
         (b)   More than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes
of stock entitled to vote or more than 50% of the total value of shares of all
classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership
of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with
respect to each such corporation.
      (3)   When one or more of the corporations subject to inclusion,
including the common parent corporation, is a nonstock corporation, the term
“stock” shall refer to the nonstock corporation membership or membership voting
rights, as is appropriate to the context.

which the tax rate is applied, and ultimately the amount of tax, including
additional or omitted tax, that is due. An ASSESSMENT shall include a written
assessment made pursuant to notice by the assessing official or a self-
assessment made by a taxpayer upon the filing of a return or otherwise not
pursuant to notice. ASSESSMENTS shall be deemed made by an assessing official
when a written notice of ASSESSMENT is delivered to the taxpayer by the
assessing official or an employee of the assessing official, or mailed to the
taxpayer at his or her last known address. SELF-ASSESSMENTS shall be deemed
made when a return is filed, or if no return is required, when the tax is paid.

in a BUSINESS:

      (1)   Engages in the trade or business of selling or soliciting the sale
of consumer products primarily in private residences and maintains no public
location for the conduct of such business;

of such remuneration being directly related to sales or other sales-oriented
services rather than to the number of hours worked; and

contract provides that such person will not be treated as an employee with
respect to such activities for federal tax purposes.

exceptions as may be imposed specifically in this chapter, a system of license
taxes measured by classified gross receipts of the business, profession, trade,
or occupation in respect to which the tax is levied. The license tax shall be
for the support of town government and for the payment of the debt of the town.
(1998 Code, § 14-38)
§ 111.04 LICENSE REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Every person in the town engaging in any business, trade, profession,
occupation, or calling, unless otherwise exempted by law, shall apply for a
license for each such business, trade, profession, occupation, or calling if
such person maintains a definite place of business in the town; such person
does not maintain a definite place of business anywhere but the person resides
in the town, which residence for the purposes of this chapter shall be deemed a
definite place of business; or there is no definite place of business in the
town but such person operates amusement machines, is engaged as a peddler or
itinerant merchant, carnival, or circus as specified in VA Code §§ 58.1-3717,
58.1-3718, or 58.1-3728, respectively, or is a contractor subject to VA Code §
58.1-3715, or is a public service corporation subject to VA Code § 58.1-3731. A
separate license shall be required for each definite place of business and for
each business. A person engaged in two or more businesses or professions
carried on at the same place of business may elect to obtain one license for
all such businesses and professions if all of the following criteria are
satisfied:
      (1)   Each business or profession is subject to licensure at the location
and has satisfied any requirements imposed by state law or other provisions of
the ordinances of the town;
      (2)   All of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax
rate, or, if subject to different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on
all businesses and professions at the highest rate; and
      (3)   The taxpayer agrees to supply such information as the Assessor may
require concerning the nature of the several businesses and their gross
receipts.
   (B)   Each person subject to a license tax and fee shall apply for a license
prior to beginning business if he or she was not subject to licensing in the
town on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later than March 1 of
the current license year if he or she had been issued a license for the
preceding license year. The application shall be on forms prescribed by the
Town Treasurer.
   (C)   The fee for issuing a license shall be paid with the application. The
tax shall be paid with the application in the case of any new businesses or
license not based on gross receipts. If the tax is measured by gross receipts
of the business, the tax shall be paid on or before March 1 each year.
   (D)   The Town Treasurer may grant an extension of time, not to exceed 90
days, in which to file an application for a license, for reasonable cause. The
extension shall be conditioned upon the timely payment of a reasonable estimate
of the appropriate tax, subject to adjustment to the correct tax at the end of
the extension, together with interest from the due date until the date paid
and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable
under the circumstances, with a penalty of 10% of the portion paid after the
due date.
   (E)   A penalty of 10% of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an
application or the failure to pay the tax by the due date. Only the late filing
penalty shall be imposed by the Assessing Official if both the application and
payment are late; however, both penalties may be assessed if the Town Treasurer
determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. In the case of an
assessment of additional tax made by the Town Treasurer, if the application
and, if applicable, the return were made in good faith and the understatement
of the tax was not due to any fraud, reckless, or intentional disregard of the
law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the
additional tax. If any assessment of tax by the Town Treasurer is not paid
within 30 days, the Town Treasurer may impose a 10% late payment penalty. The
penalties shall not be imposed, or if imposed, shall be abated by the Town
Treasurer, if the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the taxpayer. In
order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he or she acted
responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his or her control.
The terms “acted responsibly” and “events beyond the taxpayer’s control” are
defined in VA Code § 58.1-3703.1.
   (F)   Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax from the due
date until the date paid without regard to fault or other reason for the late
payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or omitted tax by the Assessing
Official is found to be erroneous, all interest and any penalties charged and
collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall be
refunded together with interest on the refund from the date of payment or the
due date, whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any BPOL
tax from the date of payment or due date, whichever is later, whether
attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on any refund shall
be paid at the same rate charged under VA Code § 58.1-3916. No interest shall
accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the
conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on
a late payment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than
30 days from the date of the payment that created the refund or the due date of
the tax, whichever is later.
(1998 Code, § 14-40) (Ord. O-2007-3, passed 9-11-2007; Ord. O-2023-05, passed

111.99
§ 111.05 SITUS OF GROSS RECEIPTS.
   (A)   General rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this chapter is measured by
gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be
only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a licensable privilege
at a definite place of business within the town. In the case of activities
conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a
customer location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place
of business from which such activities are initiated, directed, or controlled.
The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be
attributed to one or more definite places of business or offices as follows.
      (1)   The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the
definite place of business at which his or her services are performed, or if
his or her services are not performed at any definite place of business, then
the definite place of business from which his or her services are directed or
controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of VA Code §
58.1-3715.
      (2)   The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed
to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur,
or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of
business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation
activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution
house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs
of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which
deliveries of the purchased goods, wares, and merchandise are made to
customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in two or more
localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use
different measures may apply to the State Department of Taxation for a
determination as to the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject
to license tax in each locality.
      (3)   The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property
shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible
personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite
place of business, then the definite place of business at which the rental of
such property is managed.
      (4)   The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be
attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are
performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then the
definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled.
    (B)   Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of
business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite
place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule
and the affected jurisdictions are unable to reach an apportionment agreement,
except as to circumstances set forth in VA Code § 58.1-3709, the gross receipts
of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses
on the basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite
place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule
occurred at or were controlled from such definite place of business. Gross
receipts attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction
shall not be attributed to the town solely because the other jurisdiction does
not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of
business in such other jurisdiction.
   (C)   Agreements. The Assessor may enter into agreements with any other
political subdivision of the state concerning the manner in which gross
receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the
sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the
total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business
affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of
attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one
or more political subdivisions in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in
business and that the difference has resulted or is likely to result in taxes
on more than 100% of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected
jurisdictions, the Assessor shall make a good-faith effort to reach an
apportionment agreement with the other political subdivisions involved. If an
agreement cannot be reached, either the Assessor or taxpayer may seek an
advisory opinion from the State Department of Taxation pursuant to VA Code §
58.1-3701; notice of the request shall be given to the other party.
Notwithstanding the provisions of VA Code § 58.1-3993, when a taxpayer has
demonstrated to a court that two or more political subdivisions of the state
have assessed taxes on gross receipts that may create a double assessment
within the meaning of VA Code § 58.1-3986, the court shall enter such orders
pending resolution of the litigation as may be necessary to ensure that the
taxpayer is not required to pay multiple assessments even though it is not then
known which assessment is correct and which is erroneous.
(1998 Code, § 14-41)
§ 111.06 LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment
of any license tax imposed pursuant to this chapter, both the Assessing
Official and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after
such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the
period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent
agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously
agreed upon.
   (B)   Notwithstanding VA Code § 58.1-3903, the Assessing Official shall
assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure to apply for a
license for the current license year and the six preceding license years.
   (C)   The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior
to the period specified in VA Code § 58.1-3940, two years after the date of
assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this
section, two years after the final determination of an appeal for which
collection has been stayed pursuant to §
111.07(B) and (D), or two years after the final decision in a court application
pursuant to VA Code § 58.1-3984, or similar law for which collection has been
stayed, whichever is later.
(1998 Code, § 14-42)
§ 111.07 APPEALS AND RULINGS.
   (A)   Any person assessed with a licensing tax under this chapter as the
result of an audit may apply within 90 days from the date of the assessment to
the Assessing Official for a correction of the assessment. The application must
be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, audit period,
remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the
taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer’s contention. The
Assessor may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer,
or require submission of additional information and documents, a further audit,
or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of
the application. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. The
Assessor shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer’s claims and issue a
determination to the taxpayer setting forth its position. Every assessment
pursuant to an audit shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the
taxpayer’s right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be followed
in the jurisdiction (e.g., the name and address to which an application should
be directed).
   (B)   Provided a complete application is made within 90 days of an
assessment, collection activity shall be suspended until a final determination
is issued by the Assessor, unless the Assessor determines that collection would
be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for
relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in
accordance with the provisions of §
111.04(F), but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is
suspended. The term “jeopardized by delay” includes a finding that the
application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires to depart quickly from the
town, to remove his or her property from the town, to conceal himself or his or
her property in the town, or to do any other act tending to prejudice, or to
render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the tax for the
period in question.
   (C)   Any person assessed with a license tax under this chapter as a result
of an audit may apply within 90 days of the determination by the Assessing
Official on an application pursuant to division (A) above to the State Tax
Commissioner for a correction of such assessment. The Tax Commissioner shall
issue a determination to the taxpayer within 90 days of receipt of the
taxpayer’s application unless the taxpayer and the Assessing Official are
notified that a longer period will be required. The application shall be
treated as an application pursuant to VA Code § 58.1-1821, and the Tax
Commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to VA Code
§ 58.1-1822. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the Assessing
Official may apply to the appropriate Circuit Court pursuant to VA Code § 58.1-
3984. However, the burden shall be on the party making the application to show
that the ruling of the Tax Commissioner is erroneous. Neither the Tax
Commissioner nor the State Department of Taxation shall be made a party to an
application to correct an assessment merely because the Tax Commissioner has
ruled on it.
   (D)   On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the Tax
Commissioner under division (C) above, the Assessing Official shall further
suspend collection activity until a final determination is issued by the Tax
Commissioner unless the Assessor determines that collection would be
jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for
relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in
accordance with the provisions of §
111.04(F), but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is
suspended. The term “jeopardized by delay” shall have the same meaning as set
forth in division (B) above.
   (E)   Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of
the tax to a specific situation from the Assessor. Any person requesting such a
ruling must provide all the relevant facts for the situation and may present a
rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law most favorable to the
taxpayer. Any misrepresentation or change in the applicable law or the factual
situation as presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling
issued. A written ruling may be revoked or amended prospectively if there is a
change in the law, a court decision, or the guidelines issued by the State
Department of Taxation upon which the ruling was based or the Assessor notifies
the taxpayer of a change in the policy or interpretation upon which the ruling
was based. However, any person who acts on a written ruling that later becomes
invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which
such ruling was in effect.
(1998 Code, § 14-43)
§ 111.08 RECORD KEEPING AND AUDITS.
   Every person who is assessable with a license tax shall keep sufficient
records to enable the Assessor to verify the correctness of the tax paid for
the license years assessable and to enable the Assessor to ascertain the
correct amount of tax that was assessable for each of those years. All such
records, books of accounts, and other information shall be open to inspection
and examination by the Assessor in order to allow the Assessor to establish
whether a particular receipt is directly attributable to the taxable privilege
exercised within the town. The Assessor shall provide the taxpayer with the
option to conduct the audit in the taxpayer’s local business office, if the
records are maintained there. If the records are maintained outside the town,
copies of the appropriate books and records shall be sent to the Assessor’s
office upon demand.
(1998 Code, § 14-44)
§ 111.09 EXCLUSIONS AND DEDUCTIONS FROM GROSS RECEIPTS.
   (A)   General rule. Gross receipts for license tax purposes shall not
include any amount not derived from the exercise of the licensed privilege to
engage in a business or profession in the ordinary course of business or
profession.
   (B)   Exclusions. The following items shall be excluded from gross receipts:
      (1)   Amounts received and paid to the United States, the state or any
county, city, or town for the state retail sales or use tax, or for any local
sales tax or any local excise tax on cigarettes, or for any federal or state
excise taxes on motor fuels;
      (2)   Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of
another asset to the extent that the amount is attributable to a transaction
previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts receivable created by sales
that have been included in taxable receipts even though the creation of such
debt and factoring are a regular part of its business);
      (3)   Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the
business to its customer;
      (4)   Receipts that are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the
licensee is the obligor;
      (5)   Receipts representing the return of principal of a loan transaction
in which the licensee is the creditor, or the return of principal or basis upon
the sale of a capital asset;
      (6)   Rebates and discounts taken or received on account of purchases by
the licensee. A rebate or other incentive offered to induce the recipient to
purchase certain goods or services from a person other than the offeror, and
which the recipient assigns to the licensee in consideration of the sale of
goods and services, shall not be considered a rebate or discount to the
licensee but shall be included in the licensee’s gross receipts, together with
any handling or other fees related to the incentive;
      (7)   Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or
distribution and for which no consideration is received and the occasional sale
or exchange of assets other than inventory, whether or not a gain or loss is
recognized for federal income tax purposes; and
      (8)   Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised
by a licensable business not classified as rendering financial services. This
exclusion shall apply to interest on bank accounts of the business, and to
interest, dividends, and other income derived from the investment of its own
funds in securities and other types of investments unrelated to the licensed
privilege. This exclusion shall not apply to interest, late fees, and similar
income attributable to an installment sale or other transaction that occurred
in the regular course of business.
   (C)   Deductions. The following shall be deducted from gross receipts or
gross purchases that would otherwise be taxable:
      (1)   Any amount paid for computer hardware and software that are sold to
a United States federal or state government entity provided that such property
was purchased within two years of the sale to such entity by the original
purchaser who shall have been contractually obligated at the time of purchase
to resell such property to a state or federal government entity. This deduction
shall not occur until the time of resale and shall apply to only the original
cost of the property and not to its resale price, and the deduction shall not
apply to any of the tangible personal property that was the subject of the
original resale contract if it is not resold to a state or federal government
entity in accordance with the original contract obligation; and
      (2)   Any receipts attributable to business conducted in another state or
foreign country in which the taxpayer is liable for an income or other tax
based upon income.
(1998 Code, § 14-45)
§ 111.10 LICENSE FEE AND TAX.
   (A)   Every person or business subject to licensure under this chapter shall
be assessed and required to pay annually the license tax and fee for issuing
the license set forth in this section.
   (B)   The annual license tax imposed shall be at the rate set forth in this
section for those classes or enterprises listed in this section and shall be on

(1998 Code, § 14-46) (Ord. O-2023-07, passed 5-16-2023)
§ 111.11 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING LICENSE GENERALLY.
   (A)   Every person liable for the payment of a license tax under the
provisions of this chapter shall make application at the office of the Town
Treasurer and shall provide proof of the amount of gross receipts of such
business, except as in the case of a beginner.
   (B)   The Town Clerk shall furnish license application forms, which shall
provide spaces for the:
      (1)   Correct name and trade name of the applicant;
      (2)   Correct residence of the applicant;
      (3)   Nature of the business, profession, trade, or occupation for which
request of such license is being made;
      (4)   Place where such business, profession, trade, or occupation is to
be pursued; and
      (5)   Federal income tax identification number of the applicant.
   (C)   For all licenses, the Town Treasurer shall require a sworn statement
from the applicant of the amount of gross receipts of such business,
profession, trade, or occupation for the previous year, except as in the case
of a beginner.
   (D)   The application shall in all cases be signed personally by the person
who authenticates the federal income tax returns for the business, profession,
trade, or occupation.
   (E)   The Town Treasurer shall assess such applicant, or other person of
whom a license is required, with the license tax as required by this chapter.
Upon the payment of the required license tax to the
Town Treasurer, the Town Treasurer shall note the receipt of such payment on
the license application form and furnish a receipted copy to the applicant.
(1998 Code, § 14-47)
§ 111.12 ASSESSMENT OF ADDITIONAL TAX.
   (A)   Whenever the Town Treasurer shall ascertain that any person shall be
assessed with any additional license tax pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter, the Treasurer shall assess such person in writing with such additional
license tax as may be due.
   (B)   If such additional assessment shall be paid within 30 days from the
date of such additional assessment, no penalty shall accrue. If such additional
assessment shall not be paid within 30 days from the date of such additional
assessment, interest at the rate of 10% per annum shall accrue from the date of
the additional assessment until the time of payment.
(1998 Code, § 14-48)
§ 111.13 PRORATION OF LICENSE TAXES.
   If a person ceases to engage in a business, trade, profession, or calling
within the town during a year for which a license tax based on gross receipts
has already been paid, the taxpayer shall be entitled, upon application, to a
refund for that portion of the license tax already paid, prorated on a monthly
basis so as to ensure that the licensed privilege is taxed only for that
fraction of the year during which it is exercised within the town. The town may
elect to remit any refunds in the ensuing fiscal year and may offset against
such refund any amount of past-due taxes owed by the same taxpayer. In no event
shall the town be required to refund any part of a flat fee or minimum flat
tax.
(1998 Code, § 14-49)
§ 111.14 BEGINNER’S LICENSE.
   (A)   Every person who, during any calendar year, begins a business,
profession, trade, or occupation subject to a license tax under the provisions
of this chapter shall estimate the amount of the gross receipts expected
between the date of beginning business and the end of the then-current license
year. Such estimate shall be included in the license application form, and the
license tax for the then-current year shall be computed based on such estimate.
   (B)   Each such beginning business shall submit to the Town Treasurer, not
later than July 30 following the business’s first license year, a report of
actual gross receipts for the preceding year.
   (C)   Whenever a license tax for a beginning business is so computed, any
estimate found to be erroneous upon a report of actual gross receipts as
required by division (B) above shall be subject to correction. The Treasurer
shall assess such person with any additional license tax found to be due at the
end of the license year and shall at the same time correct the estimate for the
then-current license year.
Such additional license tax shall be subject to a penalty of 10% and interest
of 10% per annum from the date of the original estimate if the estimate proves
to be unreasonable. Estimates will be deemed unreasonable if they are less than
80% of the actual taxes ultimately due. In case of an overestimate, the
taxpayer shall be entitled to a credit upon his or her license tax payable the
following year.
(1998 Code, § 14-50) (Ord. passed 1-13-1998)
§ 111.15 LICENSE TO BE PERSONAL PRIVILEGE; SUSPENSION.
   Every license issued under this chapter shall be deemed to confer a personal
privilege to transact, carry on, or conduct the business, trade, or occupation
that may be subject to the license, and shall not be exercised except by the
person licensed. If it is determined that such individual to whom the license
has been issued shall have transferred the license, except as otherwise
prescribed in §
111.16, or if the Town Treasurer has cause to believe that such person is
otherwise abusing the privilege for which the license was issued, the official
may suspend such license. Such suspension shall remain in effect until the
causes are removed. The official shall report this action to the Town Council
at its next regular business meeting after the effective date of the
suspension.
(1998 Code, § 14-51)
§ 111.16 TRANSFERABILITY.
   A license issued under this chapter shall not be transferred from one person
to another. A new owner is required to obtain a beginner’s license in
accordance with §
111.14. If a business changes name without change of ownership, the change
shall be so stated in writing to the Town Treasurer.
(1998 Code, § 14-52)
§ 111.17 MULTIPLE PLACES OF BUSINESS.
   No single license shall be issued under this chapter to cover more than one
place of business.
(1998 Code, § 14-53)
§ 111.18 CORPORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS.
   When the business, profession, trade, or occupation taxed is conducted by a
corporation or partnership, the license tax shall be imposed upon the gross
receipts or gross expenditures of the corporation or the partnership, and paid
by it, and when so paid, and also when paid by an individual employing persons
who otherwise would be liable to a license, it shall be deemed to discharge the
license tax liability of the officers and partners of such corporation and
partnership and of such persons employed by an employer who otherwise would be
liable to such tax, insofar as the licensed business, profession, trade, or
occupation is concerned.
(1998 Code, § 14-54)
§ 111.19 TREASURER AS ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL; PRODUCTION OF BOOKS AND PAPERS.
   The Town Treasurer is given the responsibility of enforcing the provisions
of this chapter. The Treasurer may, for the purpose of collecting all taxes
due, summon the taxpayer or any other person to appear at the Treasurer’s
office to answer under oath questions touching the tax liability of any and all
taxpayers involved in the business.
(1998 Code, § 14-55) Penalty, see §
111.99
§ 111.20 DISPLAY OF LICENSE.
   The license form issued to show payment of the license taxes imposed by any
section of this chapter shall be displayed in a conspicuous place at the
regular place of business of the licensee, which license shall be produced by
the licensee upon request of any authorized enforcement officer of the town for
inspection. All licensees who maintain no regular place of business shall carry
on or about their persons the license form issued to show payment of the
license tax, which shall be produced by the licensee on request of any
authorized enforcement officer for his or her inspection.
(1998 Code, § 14-56) Penalty, see §
111.99
§ 111.21 COMPLIANCE WITH ZONING AND OTHER REGULATIONS.
   (A)   The Town Treasurer shall not issue a license for conducting any
business, profession, trade, or occupation at a location where the conduct of

FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
§ 151.01 AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to VA Code §§ 10.1-600 et seq.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to prevent the loss of life and
property, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce
and governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of
public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax
base by:
      (1)   Regulating uses, activities, and development that, alone or in
combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development,
will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities, and
frequencies;
      (2)   Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and
development from locating within areas subject to flooding;
      (3)   Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do
occur in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or flood proofed against
flooding and flood damage; and
      (4)   Protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
(1998 Code, § 26-31) (Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016)
§ 151.02 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter shall apply to all privately and publicly owned lands within
the jurisdiction of the town and identified as special flood hazard areas by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(1998 Code, § 26-32) (Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016)
§ 151.03 COMPLIANCE AND LIABILITY.
   (A)   No land shall be developed and no structure shall be located,
relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except
in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter and any other
applicable ordinances and regulations that apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of this chapter.
   (B)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes, such
as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside the floodplain districts, or that land uses permitted
within such districts, will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   (C)   This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the town or any
officer or employee of the town for any flood damages that result from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made under this
chapter.
(1998 Code, § 26-33) (Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.04 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes any ordinance currently in effect in flood-prone
areas. However, any underlying ordinance shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent that its provisions are more restrictive than this chapter.
(1998 Code, § 26-34) (Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016)

(1998 Code, § 26-35) (Ord. passed 5-13-1997; Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016)
§ 151.06 DESCRIPTION OF DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The various floodplain districts shall include the special flood
hazard area (SFHA). The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be
the flood insurance study (FIS) and Panel 51153C0217 D of flood insurance rate
map (FIRM) prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for Prince
William County, Virginia and Incorporated Areas, dated August 3, 2015 and
January 5, 1995, respectively as amended or revised.
   (B)   The floodway district is delineated, for purposes of this chapter,
using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of
carrying the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface
elevation of that flood more than one foot at any one point. The areas included
in this district are specifically defined in the flood insurance study and
shown on the accompanying FIRM.
   (C)   The flood fringe district shall be that area of the 1% annual chance
floodplain not included in the floodway district. The basis for the outermost
boundary of this district shall be the base flood elevations contained in the
flood profiles of the flood insurance study and as shown on the accompanying
flood insurance rate map.
   (D)   The approximated floodplain district shall be that floodplain area for
which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where the SFHA
floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as zone A on
the maps accompanying the flood insurance study. For these areas, the BFE and
floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be
used, when available. Where the specific BFE cannot be determined for this area
using other sources of data, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Floodplain
Information Reports, and U.S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, the
applicant for the proposed use, development, and/or activity shall determine
this elevation in accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, and similar data or
reports shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by
the town.
(1998 Code, § 26-36) (Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016)
§ 151.07 OFFICIAL FLOODPLAIN MAP.

(1998 Code, § 26-37) (Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016)
§ 151.08 DISTRICT BOUNDARY CHANGES.
   The delineation of any of the floodplain districts may be revised by the
Town Council where natural or human-made changes have occurred and/or where
more detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents the need for
possibility for such change. However, prior to any such change, approval must
be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A final letter of map
revision (LOMR) from FEMA is a record of this approval.
(1998 Code, § 26-38) (Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016)
§ 151.09 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the floodplain districts shall
be made by the Floodplain Administrator. Should a dispute arise concerning the
boundaries of any of the districts, the Town Council shall make the necessary
determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the
district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her
case to the Council and to submit his or her own technical evidence if he or
she so desires.
(1998 Code, § 26-39) (Ord. O-2016-01, passed 2-2-2016)
§ 151.10 DISTRICT PROVISIONS.
   (A)   All uses, activities, and development occurring within any floodplain
district, including the placement of manufactured homes, shall be undertaken
only upon the issuance of a special exception in accordance with §
151.14. Such development shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the
provisions of this chapter and with all other applicable codes and ordinances,
such as the State Uniform Statewide Building Code, being 13 VAC 5-63. Prior to
the issuance of any such permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall require all
applications to include compliance with all applicable state and federal laws.
Under no circumstances shall any use, activity, and/or development adversely
affect the capacity of the channels or floodways or any watercourse, drainage
ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
   (B)   Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any channels or of
any watercourse, stream, and the like, within this jurisdiction, a permit from
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or the State Marine Resources Commission or
the certification from the State Water Control Board may be necessary (a joint
permit application is available from any one of these organizations). Further
notification of the proposal shall be given to all affected adjacent
jurisdictions, the Division of Soil and Water Conservation (Department of
Conservation and Recreation), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (C)   All applications for the development in the floodplain district and
all special exceptions issued for the floodplain shall incorporate the
following information:
      (1)   For structures that have been elevated, the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement);
      (2)   For structures that have been flood proofed (nonresidential only),
the elevations to which the structure has been flood proofed;
      (3)   The elevation of the 100-year flood; and
      (4)   Topographic information showing the existing and proposed ground
elevations.

151.99
§ 151.11 FLOODWAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   In the floodway district, no development, including fill or
substantial improvements, shall be permitted except where the effect of such
development on flood heights is fully offset by accompanying improvements that
shall have demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed development
will not result in any increase in the base flood elevation.
   (B)   If the above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with the State Uniform Statewide Building Code, being
13 VAC 5-63 and all applicable provisions of the general standards subchapter
of this chapter (§§
151.30 through 151.40), and the elevation and construction standards section (§
151.31) and subdivision standards section (§
151.32) in this chapter.
   (C)   The placement of manufactured homes is prohibited, except when
replacing an existing manufactured home in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring,
elevation, and encroachment standards are met.

151.99
§ 151.12 FLOOD FRINGE AND APPROXIMATED FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   (A)   In Zone AE, as designated and defined on the FIRM, until a regulatory
floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development (including fill) shall be permitted, unless it is demonstrated that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the town.
   (B)   In the flood fringe and approximated floodplain districts, the
development and/or use of land shall be permitted in accordance with the
regulations of this chapter provided that all such uses, activities, and/or
development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing
and related provisions contained in the State Uniform Statewide Building Code,
being 13 VAC 5-63, the general standards subchapter in this chapter (§§
151.30 through 151.40) and the elevation and construction standards section (§
151.31) and subdivision standards section (§
151.32) in this chapter, and all other applicable codes and ordinances.
   (C)   Within the approximated floodplain areas, the applicant shall also
delineate a floodway area based on the requirement that all existing and future
development not increase the 100-year flood elevation more than one foot at any
one point. The engineering principle–equal reduction of conveyance shall be
used to make the determination of increased flood heights.
   (D)   Within the floodway area delineated by the applicant, the provisions
of §
151.11 shall also apply.

to convey the flow of surface waters without damage to persons or property.
Systems shall ensure drainage away from buildings and on-site waste disposal
sites. The Town Council may require a primarily underground system to
accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface system to accommodate
larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and
regional drainage plans. The facilities shall be designed to prevent the
discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent properties.
   (D)   Utilities. All utilities, such as gas lines, electrical, and telephone
systems, being placed in flood-prone areas shall be located, elevated (where
possible), and constructed to minimize the chance of impairment during a
flooding occurrence.
   (E)   Streets and sidewalks. Streets and sidewalks shall be designed to
minimize their potential for increasing and aggravating the levels of flood
flow. Drainage openings shall be required to sufficiently discharge flood flows
without unduly increasing flood heights.

151.99
§ 151.14 VARIANCES; FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.
   (A)   (1)   Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the Floodplain
Administrator with respect to the provisions of this chapter, it is the right
of that person to appeal to Town Council. Such appeal must be filed, in
writing, within 30 days after the determination by the permit officer.
      (2)   Upon receipt of such an appeal, the Town Council shall set a time
and place for the purpose of hearing the appeal, which shall be not less than
ten nor more than 30 days from the date of the receipt of the appeal. Notice of
the time and place of the hearing of the appeal shall be given to all parties,
at which time they may appear and be heard. The determination by the Town
Council shall be final in all cases.
      (3)   In ruling upon an appeal, the Town Council shall consider the
criteria listed in division (C) below.
   (B)   (1)   The special exception provisions of this chapter fulfill the
regulatory mandate of 44 C.F.R. § 60.6.
      (2)   In passing upon applications for a special exception, the Town
Council shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other
sections of this chapter and consider the factors listed in division (C) below.
   (C)   In considering an appeal or a request for a special exception, the
Town Council shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments. No special exception or appeal shall be
granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within the floodway
district that will cause any increase in flood levels during the base flood;
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
      (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions;
      (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners;
      (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the town;
      (6)   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use;
      (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and
development anticipated in the foreseeable future;
      (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
floodplain management program for the area;
      (10)   The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the
property in time of flood;
      (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site;
      (12)   The historic nature of a structure. Special exceptions for repair
or rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon a determination
that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure and the special exception is the
minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure; and
      (13)   Such other factors relevant to the purposes of this chapter.
   (D)   The Town Council may refer any application and accompanying
documentation pertaining to any request for a special exception or appeal to
any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in
evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood height and velocities, and
the adequacy of the plans for the flood protection, and other related matters.
   (E)   Special exceptions shall be issued and appeals granted only upon: a
showing of good and sufficient cause; after the Town Council has determined
that failure to grant the special exception or appeal would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and after the Town Council has
determined that the granting of such will not result in unacceptable or
prohibited increases in flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense, and will not create a nuisance, cause fraud or
victimization of the public, or conflict with local laws or ordinances.
   (F)   While the granting of special exceptions generally is limited to a lot
size less than one-half acre, deviations from that limitation may occur.
However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing a special exception increases. Special
exceptions may be issued by the Town Council for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, in conformance with the provisions of this section.
   (G)   Special exceptions may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that the criteria of this section are met,
and the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize
flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public
safety.
   (H)   Special exceptions shall be issued only after the Town Council has
determined that the special exception will be the minimum required to provide
relief from any hardship to the applicant.
   (I)   The Town Council shall notify the applicant for a special exception,
in writing, that the issuance of a special exception to construct a structure
below the 100-year flood elevation increases the risks to life and property and
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance.
   (J)   A record of the notification required by division (G) above, as well
as all special exception actions, including justification for their issuance,
shall be maintained; and any special exceptions shall be noted in the annual or
biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

§ 151.15 EXISTING STRUCTURES IN FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   A structure or use of a structure or premises which lawfully existed before
November 1994, but which is not in conformity with this chapter, may be
continued subject to the following conditions.
   (A)   Existing structures and/or uses located in the floodway district shall
not be expanded or enlarged unless the effect of the proposed expansion or
enlargement on flood heights is fully offset by accompanying improvements.
   (B)   Any modifications, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement
of any kind to a structure and/or use located in any floodplain district to an
extent or amount of less than 50% of its market value shall conform to the
State Uniform Statewide Building Code, being 13 VAC 5-63 and the appropriate
provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement
of any kind to a structure and/or use, regardless of its location in a
floodplain district, to an extent or amount of 50% or more of its market value
shall be undertaken only in full compliance with this chapter, and the entire
structure shall conform to the provisions of this chapter and the State Uniform
Statewide Building Code, being 13 VAC 5-63.
   (D)   Uses or their adjuncts that are or become nuisances shall not be
permitted to continue.
   (E)   No building or structure shall be occupied/reoccupied after a natural
disaster such as fire or flood without an inspection and approval for
structural stability and livability by the Town Building Official.

components during conditions of flooding.
   (F)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system.
   (G)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
   (H)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (I)   In addition to provisions in divisions (A) through (H) above, in all
special flood hazard areas, the flood carrying capacity within an altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse shall be maintained.
(1998 Code, § 26-46) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.31 ELEVATION AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In all identified flood hazard areas where base flood elevations have been
provided in the FIS or generated by a certified professional in accordance with
§
151.06(C), the following provisions shall apply.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) in Zones AE and A
(as defined on the FIRM) with detailed base flood elevations shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level
plus 18 inches.
   (B)   Nonresidential construction.
      (1)   New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or nonresidential building (or manufactured home) shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level,
plus 18 inches.
      (2)   Nonresidential buildings located in all AE zones (as defined on the
FIRM) may be flood proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of
the building components below the elevation corresponding to the BFE plus two
feet are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this
division (B) are satisfied. Such certification, including the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood
proofed, shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Space below the lowest floor. In zones A and AE (as defined on the
FIRM), fully enclosed areas, of new construction or substantially improved
structures, which are below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall:
      (1)   Not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall be used
solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). Be constructed
entirely of flood-resistant materials below the regulatory flood protection
elevation; and
      (2)   Include measures to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this
requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer
or architect or meet the following minimum design criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The total net area of all openings must be at least one square
inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (c)   If a building has more than one enclosed area, each area must
have openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit;
         (d)   The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one
foot above the adjacent grade;
         (e)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         (f)   Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not
considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   In zones A and AE (as defined on the FIRM), all manufactured homes
placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, must meet all
the requirements for new construction, including the elevation and anchoring
requirements in the general standards section, and the elevation and
construction standards section of this chapter.
      (2)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
         (a)   Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, be fully
licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway
use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached additions); or
         (b)   Meet all the standards for manufactured homes in this chapter.

   (Q)   It is the duty of the Floodplain Administrator to take into account
flood, mudslide, and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are
known, in all official actions relating to land management and use throughout
the entire jurisdictional area of the town, whether or not those hazards have
been specifically delineated geographically (e.g., via mapping or surveying).
(1998 Code, § 26-53)
§ 151.36 USE AND INTERPRETATION OF FIRMS.
   (A)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries,
and floodway boundaries.
   (B)   The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and
data:
      (1)   Where field surveyed topography indicates that adjacent ground
elevations:
         (a)   Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated
as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as
special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of these regulations;
         (b)   Are above the base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated
as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map
change that removes the area from the SFHA.
      (2)   In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood
elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA
has not identified SFHAs, any other flood hazard data available from a federal,
state, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used;
      (3)   Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs
and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths
and/or lower base flood elevations;
      (4)   Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show
increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on
FIRMs and in FISs; and
      (5)   If a preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or a preliminary
flood insurance study has been provided by FEMA:
         (a)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and shall replace the flood
hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations;
         (b)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best
available data pursuant to §
151.06(C) and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are
provided on the effective FIRM; and
         (c)   Prior to issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary
base flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or
designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
(1998 Code, § 26-54)
§ 151.37 JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARY CHANGES.
   (A)   Before the town boundary with Prince William or Fairfax County
changes, the Town Council shall pass a resolution acknowledging and accepting
responsibility for enforcing floodplain ordinance standards. If the FIRM for
any added area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that
have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in these regulations, the
Floodplain Administrator shall prepare amendments to this chapter to adopt the
FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the governing
body for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior
to the date of boundary change and a copy of the amended regulations shall be
provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety
and Floodplain Management) and FEMA.
   (B)   In accordance with 44 C.F.R. § 59.22(a)(9)(v), the town will notify
the Federal Insurance Administration and optionally the State Coordinating
Office in writing whenever the boundaries of the town have been modified or the
town has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area.
   (C)   In order that all flood insurance rate maps accurately represent the
town’s boundaries, a copy of a map of the town suitable for reproduction,
clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for which the town has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority shall be
included with the notification.
(1998 Code, § 26-55)
§ 151.38 SUBMITTING MODEL BACKED TECHNICAL DATA.
   The town’s base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from
physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not
later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the
town shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data. The town may submit data via a LOMR.
Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical
changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates, and floodplain
management requirements will be based upon current data.
(1998 Code, § 26-56)
§ 151.39 LETTERS OF MAP REVISION.
   (A)   When development in the floodplain will cause or causes a change in
the base flood elevation, the applicant, including state agencies, must notify
FEMA by applying for a conditional letter of map revision and then a letter of
map revision.
   (B)   Example cases include: any development that causes a rise in the base
flood elevations within the floodway; any development occurring in Zones A1-30
and AE (as defined on the FIRM) without a designated floodway, which will cause
a rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation; and/or alteration or
relocation of a stream (including, but not limited to, installing culverts and
bridges) 44 C.F.R. §§ 65.3 and 65.6(a)(12).
(1998 Code, § 26-57)

   (A)   Except as provided in this section, no person shall engage in any land
disturbing activity until an erosion and sediment control plan for such
activity has been submitted to and approved by the town. For the purposes of
this section, when land disturbing activity will be required of a contractor
performing construction work pursuant to a construction contract, the
preparation, submission, and approval of an erosion and sediment control plan
shall be the responsibility of the owner. The plan shall indicate phases of
construction, as appropriate, and a detailed narrative shall be submitted to
indicate in detail the timing and method of implementing each phase. This
phased plan shall be designed to ensure adequate erosion and sediment control
protection from the beginning of a project until its completion. Where storm
sewers or paved areas are to be constructed, there shall be a minimum of two
phases indicated on all erosion and sediment control plans. Plans shall clearly
state when any proposed stormwater management facility is to be constructed.
   (B)   Any person who owns, occupies, or operates private agricultural,
horticultural, or forest lands shall not be deemed to be in violation of this
chapter for land disturbing activities that result from the tilling, planting,
or harvesting of agricultural, horticultural, or forest crops, or products of
engineering operations.
   (C)   Where land disturbing activities involve lands under the jurisdiction
of more than one local control program, an erosion and sediment control plan
may, at the option of the applicant, be submitted to the Board for review and
approval rather than to each jurisdiction concerned.
   (D)   (1)   Electric, natural gas, and telephone utility companies,
interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline companies and railroad companies
shall file general erosion and sediment control specifications annually with
the Board for review and written comments. The specifications shall apply to:

§ 152.06 ACTION ON EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLANS.
   (A)   The town, through the Town Engineer, shall, within 45 days, approve
any erosion and sediment control plan submitted or specify, in writing, to the
applicant, such modifications, terms, and conditions that will permit approval
of the plan. The person responsible for carrying out the plan shall certify
that he or she will properly perform the conservation measures included in the
plan and will conform to the provisions of this chapter. In addition, as a
prerequisite to engaging in the land disturbing activities shown on the
approved plan, the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall provide
the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence, to the program
authority, as provided by VA Code § 10.1-561, of the State Erosion and Sediment
Control Law, who will be in charge of and responsible for carrying out the land
disturbing activity. Failure to provide the name of an individual holding a
certificate of competence prior to engaging in land disturbing activities may
result in revocation of the approval of the plan and the person responsible for
carrying out the plan shall be subject to the penalties provided in this
chapter. If no action is taken by the plan approving authority within the time
specified in this section, the plan shall be deemed approved and the person
authorized to proceed with the proposed activity. However, any plan approving
authority may waive the certificate of competence
requirement for an agreement in lieu of a plan for construction of a single
family residence. If a violation occurs during the land disturbing activity,
then the person responsible for carrying out the agreement in lieu of a plan
shall correct the violation and provide the name of an individual holding a
certificate of competence, as provided by VA Code § 10.1-561.
   (B)   The town shall immediately transmit, for review, the plan to the
district, which will return comments within 30 days.
   (C)   The approved plan may be changed by the town which has approved the
plan, in the following cases:
      (1)   Where inspection has revealed the inadequacy of the plan to
accomplish the erosion and sediment control objectives of the plan, appropriate
modifications to correct the deficiencies of the plan may be directed by the
town; and
      (2)   Where the person responsible for carrying out the approved plan
finds that, because of changed circumstances or for other reasons, the approved
plan cannot be effectively carried out, and proposed amendments to the plan,
consistent with the requirements of this chapter, are agreed to by the town and
the person responsible for carrying out the plan.
   (D)   Any person engaging, in more than one jurisdiction, in the creation
and operation of wetland mitigation or stream restoration banks, which have
been approved and have been operated in accordance with applicable federal and
state guidance, laws, or regulations for the establishment, use, and operation
of wetlands mitigation or stream restoration banks, pursuant to a mitigation
banking instrument signed by the Department of Environmental Quality, the
Marine Resources Commission, or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, may, at the
option of that person, file general erosion and sediment control specifications
for wetland mitigation or stream restoration banks annually with the Board for
review and approval consistent with guidelines established by the Board.
Projects not included in this division (D) shall comply with this chapter.
Approval of general erosion and sediment control specifications by the Board
does not relieve the owner or operator from compliance with any other local
ordinances and regulations including requirements to submit plans and obtain
permits as may be required by such ordinances and regulations.

§ 152.09 APPROVED PLAN REQUIRED FOR ISSUANCE OF PERMITS; CERTIFICATION; BONDING
OF PERFORMANCE.
   (A)   The town shall not issue any grading, land disturbing, building, or
other permits for activities that involve land disturbing activities unless the
applicant submits, with his or her application, the approved erosion and
sediment control plan or certification of such approved plan from the town and
certification that such plan will be followed. Permits for permanent
construction shall not be issued until the initial erosion and sediment control
measures have been inspected and approved by the Town Engineer.
   (B)   The town, prior to the issuance of any grading, land disturbing,
building, or other permit, may require from any applicant a reasonable
performance bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit, any combination
thereof, or such other legal arrangement as is acceptable to the town, to
ensure that emergency measures could be taken by the town, at the applicant’s
expense, should he or she fail, within the time specified, to initiate
appropriate conservation action, which may be required of him or her as a
result of his or her land disturbing activity. This bond, cash escrow, letter
of credit, or other acceptable legal arrangement will provide for a right of
entry by representatives of the town for the purpose of inspection,
reinstallation, maintenance, or any other conservation practice that may be
necessary. Within 60 days of the achievement of adequate stabilization of the
land disturbing activity in any project or section of such activity, the bond,
cash escrow, letter of credit, or other legal arrangement, or the unexpended or
unobligated portion of such arrangement, shall be refunded to the applicant or
terminated
based upon the percentage of stabilization accomplished in the project or
section of the project. The town may collect stabilization costs in excess of
the security held.
   (C)   The requirements of this section are in addition to all other
provisions of the law that relate to the issuance of such permits. The
Building/Code Official shall issue no building or other permit until the
erosion and sediment control measures have been inspected and approved by the
town.
(1998 Code, § 18-39)
§ 152.10 MONITORING, REPORTS, AND INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   The town, through the Town Engineer or other agent, shall periodically
inspect the land disturbing activity to ensure compliance with the approved
plan, and to determine whether the measures required in that plan are effective
in controlling erosion and sediment resulting from the land disturbing
activity. For purposes of this section, the word PERIODICALLY means during or
immediately following initial installation of erosion and sediment controls, at
least once in every two-week period, within 48 hours following any runoff
producing storm event, and at the completion of the project prior to the
release of any performance bonds. The right of entry to conduct such
inspections shall be expressly reserved in the permit. The owner, permittee, or
person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be given notice of the
inspection. If the town, through the Town Engineer, finds that the permit
holder has failed to comply with the plan, the town shall immediately serve a
notice to comply upon the permit holder by registered or certified mail, at the
address to be specified by the permit holder in his or her permit application.
Such notice shall set forth specifically the measures necessary to comply with
such plan. If no action is taken within the time specified in the letter, the
town shall prepare a letter of intent to use the escrow account to correct the
deficiency. This letter will be cleared by the Town Attorney and sent by
registered mail to the owner, builder, or developer, with a copy to the escrow
agent. The town will undertake the work, and the applicable account shall then
be reimbursed from the escrow account. The owner, builder, or developer shall
then be obligated to replenish the escrow account within ten days of the
expenditure. Failure to do so will constitute a violation of this chapter. In
addition, if the owner, builder, or developer fails to act within the specified
time, the permit may be revoked; furthermore, the permittee or person
responsible for carrying out the plan shall be deemed to be in violation of
this chapter; and, upon conviction, shall be subject to the penalties provided
by this chapter. Upon issuance of the letter of intent, the town and the
Building/Code Official shall withhold all future permits until such violation
is corrected.
   (B)   With respect to approved plans for erosion and sediment control in
connection with all regulated land disturbing activities that require no
permit, the town may require of the person responsible for carrying out the
plan such monitoring and reports, and may make such on-site inspections, after
notice to that person, as are deemed necessary to determine whether the soil
erosion and sediment control has been performed, and whether such measures are
effective in controlling soil erosion and sediment resulting from the land
disturbing activity. The owner, permittee, or person responsible for carrying
out the plan shall be given notice of the inspection. If it is determined that
there is a failure to comply with the approved plan, the town shall serve
notice of such failure upon the person who is responsible for carrying out the
plan, at the address specified by him or her in his or her certification, at
the time of obtaining his or her approved plan. Such notice shall set forth the
measures necessary for compliance
and the time within which such measures shall be completed. Upon failure of
such person to comply within the specified period, he or she will be deemed to
be in violation of this chapter and, upon conviction, shall be subject to the
penalties provided for by this chapter.
   (C)   After land clearing operations have begun, no area shall be denuded
for more than 30 days unless authorized by the town. All trenches for storm
sewer, electric power, telephone, water, and gas lines are to be back-filled,
compacted, seeded, and mulched within seven days after installation.
   (D)   For projects involving more than two acres of land disturbance, permit
holders will be required to file periodic reports to document monitoring and
compliance with the approved plan. Such reports shall be in a form approved by
the Town Engineer and shall be certified by a registered professional engineer.
   (E)   (1)   Upon determination of a violation of this chapter, the Mayor or
Town Engineer may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as
specified in this chapter, issue an order requiring that all or part of the
land disturbing activities permitted on the site be stopped until the specified
corrective measures have been taken.
      (2)   If land disturbing activities have commenced without an approved
plan, the Mayor or Town Engineer may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a
notice to comply as specified in this chapter, issue an order requiring that
all of the land disturbing activities be stopped until an approved plan or any
required permits are obtained.
      (3)   Where the alleged noncompliance is causing or is in imminent danger
of causing harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition in waters within the
watersheds of the state, or where the land disturbing activities have commenced
without an approved plan or any required permits, such an order may be issued
without regard to whether the permittee has been issued a notice to comply as
specified in this chapter. Otherwise, such an order may be issued only after
the permittee has failed to comply with such a notice to comply. The order
shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in
effect for a period of seven days from the date of service pending application
by the enforcing authority or permit holder for appropriate relief to the
Circuit Court.
      (4)   If the alleged violator has not obtained an approved plan or any
required permits within seven days from the date of service of the order, the
Mayor or Town Engineer may issue an order to the owner requiring that all
construction and other work on the site, other than corrective measures, be
stopped until an approved plan and any required permits have been obtained.
Such an order shall be served upon the owner by registered or certified mail to
the address specified in the permit application or the land records of the
town.
      (5)   The owner may appeal the issuance of an order to the Circuit Court.
      (6)   Any person violating or failing, neglecting, or refusing to obey an
order issued by the Mayor or Town Engineer may be compelled in a proceeding
instituted in the Circuit Court to obey same and to comply therewith by
injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate remedy. Upon completion and approval
of corrective action or obtaining an approved plan or any required permits, the
order shall immediately be lifted.
      (7)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the Mayor or Town Engineer
from taking any other action authorized by this chapter.

   (A)   The Administrator shall require the provision of long-term
responsibility for and maintenance of stormwater management facilities and
other techniques specified to manage the quality and quantity of runoff. Such
requirements shall be set forth in an instrument recorded in the local land
records prior to general permit termination or earlier as required by the
Administrator and shall at a minimum:
      (1)   Be submitted to the Administrator for review and approval prior to

   (B)   At the discretion of the Administrator, such recorded instruments need
not be required for stormwater management facilities designed to treat
stormwater runoff primarily from an individual residential lot on which they
are located, provided it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Administrator that future maintenance of such facilities will be addressed
through an enforceable mechanism at the discretion of the Administrator. If the
Administrator exercises the discretion granted by this division (B), he or she
will document that decision and the nature of the enforceable mechanism in the
applicable record, which will thereafter be retained for as long as the
enforceable mechanism remains in effect, and for one year thereafter.
   (C)   If a recorded instrument is not required pursuant to division (B)
above, the Administrator shall develop a strategy for addressing maintenance of
stormwater management facilities designed to treat
stormwater runoff primarily from an individual residential lot. Such a strategy
may include periodic inspections, homeowner outreach and education, or other
method targeted at promoting the long-term maintenance of such facilities. Such
facilities may not be subject to the requirement for an inspection to be
conducted by the Administrator.

necessary to address a TMDL.
   (B)   The Administrator may, at reasonable times and under reasonable
circumstances, enter any establishment or upon any property, public or private,
for the purpose of obtaining information or conducting surveys or
investigations necessary in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   In accordance with a performance bond with surety, cash escrow, letter
of credit, any combination thereof, or such other legal arrangement or
instrument, the Administrator may also enter any establishment or upon any
property, public or private, for the purpose of initiating or maintaining
appropriate actions which are required by the permit conditions associated with
a land disturbing activity when a permittee, after proper notice, has failed to
take acceptable action within the time specified.
   (D)   Pursuant to VA Code § 62.1-44.15:40, the Administrator may require
every VSMP authority permit applicant or permittee, or any such person subject
to VSMP authority permit requirements under this chapter, to furnish when
requested such application materials, plans, specifications, and other
pertinent information as may be necessary to determine the effect of his or her
discharge on the quality of state waters, or such other information as may be
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Post-construction inspections of stormwater management facilities
required by the provisions of this chapter shall be conducted by the
Administrator pursuant to the locality’s adopted and State Board approved
inspection program, and shall occur, at minimum, at least once every five years
except as may otherwise be provided for in §

(1998 Code, § 18-61) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.12 HEARINGS.
   (A)   Any permit applicant or permittee, or person subject to this chapter’s
requirements, aggrieved by any action of the town taken without a formal
hearing, or by inaction of the town, may demand in writing a formal hearing by
the Town Council. A petition requesting a hearing based on town action must be
filed with the Administrator within 30 days after notice of such action is
given by the Administrator. A petition based on town inaction must be filed
within 30 days after the town’s deadline for action, if there is one, or if

or constructive notice that the town should have acted.
   (B)   The hearings held under this section shall be conducted by the Town
Council at a regular or special meeting of the Town Council, or by at least one
member of the Town Council designated by the Town Council to conduct such
hearings on behalf of the Town Council at any other time and place authorized
by the Town Council. The town shall give at least 15 days’ notice of the date,
time, and location of the hearing to the party filing the appeal and to the

acted upon by the Town Council, or its designated member(s), whose action may
include the procurement of an order of enforcement from the Circuit Court.
Witnesses who are subpoenaed shall receive the same fees and reimbursement for
mileage as in civil actions.
(1998 Code, § 18-62)
§ 153.13 APPEALS.
   (A)   Final decisions of the town under this chapter shall be subject to
appeal to the County Circuit Court, provided that an appeal is filed within 30
days from the date of any written decision adversely affecting the rights,
duties, or privileges of the person engaging in or proposing to engage in land
disturbing activities.
   (B)   The burden shall be upon the party complaining of town action to
designate and demonstrate an error subject to review by the court. Allegations
of error may be based upon: accordance with constitutional right, power,
privilege, or immunity; compliance with statutory authority, jurisdiction
limitations, or right as provided in the Act, the stated objectives for which
regulations may be made, and the factual showing respecting violations or
entitlement in connection with case decisions; observance of required procedure
where any failure therein is not mere harmless error; and the substantiality of
the evidentiary support for findings of fact. The determination of the
substantiality of the evidence shall be made upon the whole evidentiary record
provided by the town and the court shall determine whether there was
substantial evidence in the town’s record to support its decision.
   (C)   The court shall take due account of the presumption of official
regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the town, and the
purposes of the Act.

nondiscretionary action that the town has withheld, or remand the matter to the
town for further proceedings as the court may permit or direct in accordance
with law. The court shall not itself undertake to supply town action committed
by the Act to the town.
(1998 Code, § 18-63)
§ 153.14 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   If the Administrator determines that there is a failure to comply with
the VSMP authority permit conditions or an agreement in lieu of a stormwater
management plan or determines there is an unauthorized discharge, notice shall
be served upon the permittee or person responsible for carrying out the permit
conditions by any of the following: verbal warnings and inspection reports;
notices of corrective action; consent special orders; and notices to comply.
Written notices shall be served by registered or certified mail to the address
specified in the permit application or by delivery at the site of the
development activities to the agent or employee supervising such activities.
      (1)   The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the
permit conditions and shall specify the time within which such measures shall
be completed. Upon failure to comply within the time specified, a stop work
order may be issued in accordance with division (B) below or the permit may be
revoked by the Administrator.
      (2)   If a permittee fails to comply with a notice issued in accordance
with this section within the time specified, the Administrator may issue an
order requiring the owner, permittee, person responsible for carrying out an
approved plan, or the person conducting the land disturbing activities without
an
approved plan or required permit to cease all land disturbing activities until
the violation of the permit has ceased, or an approved plan and required
permits are obtained, and specified corrective measures have been completed.
      (3)   Such orders shall be issued in accordance with local procedures, if
adopted. In the absence of local procedures, such orders shall provide
sufficient information for the recipient(s) to understand and comply with the
order. Such orders shall become effective upon service on the person by
certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to his or her address specified
in the land records of the locality, or by personal delivery by an agent of the
Administrator. However, if the Administrator finds that any such violation is
grossly affecting or presents an imminent and substantial danger of causing
harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition in waters within the watersheds
of the state or otherwise substantially impacting water quality, it may issue,
without advance notice or hearing, an emergency order directing such person to
cease immediately all land disturbing activities on the site and shall provide
an opportunity for a hearing, after reasonable notice as to the time and place
thereof, to such person, to affirm, modify, amend, or cancel such emergency
order. If a person who has been issued an order is not complying with the terms
thereof, the Administrator may institute a proceeding for an injunction,
mandamus, or other appropriate remedy in accordance with division (C) below.
   (B)   In addition to any other remedy provided by this chapter, if the
Administrator or his or her designee determines that there is a failure to
comply with the provisions of this chapter, he or she may initiate such
informal and/or formal administrative enforcement procedures in a manner that
is consistent with the public interest.
   (C)   Any person violating or failing, neglecting, or refusing to obey any
rule, regulation, ordinance, order, approved standard or specification, or any
permit condition issued by the Administrator may be compelled in a proceeding
instituted in County Circuit Court by the locality to obey same and to comply
therewith by injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate remedy.
(1998 Code, § 18-64) Penalty, see §
153.99
§ 153.15 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   Prior to issuance of any permit, the Administrator may require a reasonable
performance bond with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit, any combination
thereof, or such other legal arrangement acceptable to the local government
attorney, to ensure that measures could be taken by the town at the applicant’s
expense should he or she fail, after proper notice, within the time specified
to initiate or maintain appropriate actions which may be required of him or her
by the permit conditions as a result of his or her land disturbing activity. If
the town takes such action upon such failure by the applicant, the locality may
collect from the applicant for the difference should the amount of the
reasonable cost of such action exceed the amount of the security held, if any.
Within 60 days of the completion of the requirements of the permit conditions,
such bond, cash escrow, letter of credit, or other legal arrangement, or the
unexpended or unobligated portion thereof, shall be refunded to the applicant
or terminated.
(1998 Code, § 18-65)
§ 153.16 FEES.
   All incomplete payments will be deemed as nonpayments. The town shall
provide notification to the state applicant of any incomplete payments.
(1998 Code, § 18-66) (Ord. O-2015-01, passed 1-6-2015)
§ 153.99 PENALTY.

neglects, or refuses to comply with any order of the Administrator, shall be
subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $32,500 for each violation within the
discretion of the court. Each day of violation of each requirement shall
constitute a separate offense.
      (1)   Violations for which a penalty may be imposed under this division
(A)(1) shall include but not be limited to the following:
         (a)   No state permit registration;
         (b)   No SWPPP;

         (k)   Discharges not in compliance with the requirements of 4 VAC §
50-60-1170 of the general permit.
      (2)   The Administrator may issue a summons for collection of the civil
penalty and the action may be prosecuted in the appropriate court.
      (3)   In imposing a civil penalty pursuant to this division (A), the
court may consider the degree of harm caused by the violation and also the
economic benefit to the violator from noncompliance.
      (4)   Any civil penalties assessed by a court as a result of a summons
issued by the locality shall be paid into the treasury of the town to be used
for the purpose of minimizing, preventing, managing, or mitigating pollution of
the waters of the locality and abating environmental pollution therein in such
manner as the court may, by order, direct.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any other civil or equitable remedy provided by this
section or by law, any person who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this chapter, any order of the Administrator, any condition of a
permit, or any order of a court shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by
confinement in jail for not more than 12 months or a fine of not less than
$2,500 nor more than $32,500, or both.

LANDSCAPE PLAN
§ 155.075 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish minimum standards for
the design, installation, and maintenance of landscaped areas that require the
use of appropriate native vegetation and to promote the preservation of
indigenous plant communities on-site. The town recognizes the significant
benefits of establishing and protecting appropriate native vegetation and,
therefore, the necessity to maximize the use of appropriate native vegetation
in all public and private landscaped areas within the town.
   (B)   It is the intent of this chapter that these minimum landscape
requirements be incorporated in order to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare by:
      (1)   Protecting and promoting appropriate native vegetation;
      (2)   Promoting microhabitats in urban areas for the conservation of
wildlife by establishing new wildlife habitat and maintaining existing wildlife
habitat;
      (3)   Creating larger, more connected plant habitats, helping ensure the
future of native plant species by increasing their ability to respond to
changes in climate;
      (4)   Conserving scarce water resources by promoting water-efficient
landscaping through the use of appropriate native plants which, once
established, typically require much less water than other species;
      (5)   Reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to maintain
landscaping;
      (6)   Reducing the negative impacts of landscape maintenance on local air
quality;
      (7)   Reducing the negative impacts on the land from the use of
inappropriate vegetation and poorly planned landscaping;
      (8)   Reducing the financial costs of landscape maintenance; and
      (9)   Encouraging creative landscaping designs that further the above
stated goals.

   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish certain subdivision
standards and procedures for the town as provided for by VA Code §§ 15.2-2240
through 15.2-2279. These regulations are part of a long-range plan to guide and
facilitate the orderly, beneficial growth of the community, and to promote the
public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare.
More specifically, the purposes of these standards and procedures are to
provide a guide for the change that occurs when land is developed for
residential, business, or industrial purposes; assurance that the purchasers of
lots are buying a commodity that is suitable for development and use; and to
make possible the provision of public services in a safe, adequate, and
efficient manner.
   (B)   Subdivided land eventually becomes a public responsibility because
roads and streets must be maintained, and numerous public services customary to
urban areas must be provided. This chapter assists the community in meeting
these responsibilities.

agent using the most recent county unit price list. Such bond or check shall
guarantee that the improvements will be installed within a reasonable length of
time in a manner acceptable to the agent. The bond or check shall accompany the
final plat. When construction has been completed, approved, and accepted on
sections of the required improvements, the agent may release the bond submitted
for the amount of the entire required improvements or a portion thereof leaving
an amount adequate to cover the entire cost of the improvements yet to be
constructed, approved, and accepted.
         (b)   Occupancy permits shall not be issued until all proposed public
and private improvements on a site plan are completed; however, the Zoning
Administrator shall have the authority, in his or her discretion and in
appropriate cases, to accept a completion bond in a satisfactory amount to
ensure completion of public or private improvements in lieu of actual
completion where the Zoning Administrator finds that a completion bond
adequately protects future owners.
      (2)   Maintenance bond. The subdivider shall be required to file a
maintenance bond with the town in an amount considered adequate and in a form
satisfactory to the town, in order to assure the satisfactory condition of the
required landscape improvements, for a period of one year after the date of
their acceptance.
      (3)   Phased development. If development is projected over a period of
years, the agent may authorize submission of final plats by section or phase of
development, subject to requirements or guarantees for improvements in future
sections or phases of development essential for the protection of any approved
section of development.
      (4)   Absence of bond. In the absence of a performance bond or check, no
final plat shall be approved or recorded until the required improvements have
been installed and approved by the agent or his or her authorized
representative.

CHESAPEAKE BAY PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 157.150 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries are one of the most important
and productive estuarine systems in the world, providing economic and social
benefits to the citizens of the town and the state. The health of the bay is
vital to maintaining the town’s economy and the welfare of its citizens.
   (B)   The Chesapeake Bay waters have been degraded significantly by many
sources of pollution, including nonpoint source pollution from land uses and
development. Existing high-quality waters are worthy of protection from
degradation to guard against further pollution. Certain lands that are
proximate to shorelines have intrinsic water quality value due to the
ecological and biological processes they perform. Other lands have severe
development constraints from flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. With
proper management, significant ecological benefits can be achieved by providing
water quality maintenance and pollution control, as well as flood and shoreline
erosion control. The lands designated by the Town Council as Chesapeake Bay
Preservation Areas need to be protected from destruction and damage in order to
protect the quality of water in the bay and consequently the quality of life in
the town and the state.
(1998 Code, § 66-191) (Ord. passed 9-5-2017)
§ 157.151 PURPOSE AND INTENT.

830-20 et seq. Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area designation and management
regulations.
   (B)   The intent of the Town Council and the purpose of the overlay district
is to:
      (1)   Protect existing high-quality state waters;
      (2)   Restore all other state waters to a condition or quality that will
permit all reasonable public uses and will support the propagation and growth
of all aquatic life, including game fish, that might reasonably be expected to
inhabit them;
      (3)   Safeguard the clean waters of the state from pollution;
      (4)   Prevent any increase in pollution;
      (5)   Reduce existing pollution; and
      (6)   Promote water resource conservation in order to provide for the
health, safety, and welfare of the present and future citizens of the town.
   (C)   This district shall be in addition to and shall overlay all other
zoning districts where they are applied so that any parcel of land lying in the
Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay District shall also lie in one or more
of the other zoning districts provided for by this chapter. Unless otherwise
stated in the overlay district, the review and approval procedures provided for
in Chapters 111, 151, 152, and 156 of this code shall be followed in reviewing
and approving development, redevelopment, and uses governed by this division.
   (D)   This subchapter is enacted under the authority of VA Code §§ 62.1-
44.15:72 et seq. (the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act), and 9 VAC § 25-830-20,
and VA Code § 15.2-2283, stating that “such ordinance may also include
reasonable provisions, not inconsistent with applicable state water quality
standards, to protect surface water and ground water as defined in VA Code §
62.1-255”.

terms not defined in this subchapter but defined in this chapter shall be given
the meanings previously set forth.
   APPLICANT. A person seeking any determination under this part or permit
required by this subchapter.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMPS). A practice, or a combination of practices,
that is determined by a state or designated area-wide planning agency to be the
most effective, practical means of preventing or reducing the amount of
pollution generated by nonpoint sources to a level compatible with water
quality goals.
   BUFFER AREA. Natural or established vegetation managed to protect other
components of a resource protection area and state waters from significant
degradation due to land disturbances.
   CHESAPEAKE BAY PRESERVATION AREA (CBPA). Any land designated by the Town
Council pursuant to part III of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area
designation and management regulations, 9 VAC §§ 25-830-70 et seq. and 62.1-
44.15:72. A CBPA shall consist of a resource protection area and a resource
management area.
   CONSTRUCTION FOOTPRINT. The area of all impervious surface including, but
not limited to, buildings, roads and drives, parking areas, sidewalks, and the
area necessary for construction of such improvements.
   DEVELOPMENT. The construction or substantial alteration of residential,
commercial, industrial, institutional, recreation, transportation, or utility

index (EI) from sheet and rill erosion equal to or greater than eight. The
erodibility index for any soil is defined as the product of the formula RKLS/T,
where K is the soil susceptibility to water erosion in the surface layer; R is
the rainfall and runoff; LS is the combined effects of slope length and
steepness; and T is the soil loss tolerance.
   HIGHLY PERMEABLE SOILS. Soils with a given potential to transmit water
through the soil profile. HIGHLY PERMEABLE SOILS are identified as any soil
having a permeability equal to or greater than six inches of water movement per
hour in any part of the soil profile to a depth of 72 inches, permeability
groups rapid and very rapid, as found in the National Soil Survey Handbook of

(1998 Code, § 66-199) (Ord. passed 9-5-2017)
§ 157.159 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   The purpose and intent of this section is to prevent a net increase
in nonpoint source pollution from new development and achieve a 10% reduction
in nonpoint source pollution from redevelopment.
      (2)   The performance standards establish the means to minimize erosion
and sedimentation potential, reduce land application of nutrients and toxics,
and maximize rainwater infiltration. Natural ground cover, especially woody
vegetation, is most effective in holding soil in place and preventing site
erosion. Indigenous vegetation, with its adaptability to local conditions
without the use of harmful fertilizers or pesticides, is an especially
effective filter of stormwater runoff. Minimizing impervious
cover enhances rainwater infiltration and effectively reduces stormwater runoff
potential.
      (3)   Except as otherwise expressly stated in this chapter, development
in Chesapeake Bay Preservation Areas shall comply with state regulations found
at 9 VAC 25-830-130, 9 VAC 25-830-140, and 9 VAC 25-830-150.
   (B)   General performance standards for development and redevelopment.
      (1)   Land disturbance shall be limited to the area necessary to provide
for the proposed use or development.
         (a)   In accordance with an approved site plan, the limits of land
disturbance, including clearing or grading, shall be strictly defined by the
construction footprint. These limits shall be clearly shown on submitted plans
and physically marked on the development site.
         (b)   Ingress and egress during construction shall be limited to one
access point unless otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Indigenous vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent
practicable, consistent with the use or development proposed, and in accordance
with the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
         (a)   Existing trees over six inches DBH shall be preserved outside
the construction footprint. Diseased trees or trees weakened by age, storm,
fire or other injury may be removed.
         (b)   Clearing shall be allowed only to provide necessary access,
positive site drainage, water quality BMPs, and the installation of utilities,
as approved by the Zoning Administrator.
         (c)   Prior to clearing or grading, suitable protective barriers, such
as safety fencing, shall be erected one foot outside of the dripline of any
tree or stand of trees to be preserved. These protective barriers shall remain
erected throughout all phases of construction. The storage of equipment,
materials, debris, or fill shall not be allowed within the area protected by
the barrier.
      (3)   Land development shall minimize impervious cover to promote
infiltration of stormwater into the ground consistent with the proposed use or
development permitted.
      (4)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this division (B) or
exceptions or exemptions to this division (B), any land disturbing activity
exceeding 2,500 square feet, including construction of all single-family
houses, shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 152 of this code.
      (5)   All existing sewage disposal systems not requiring a VPDES permit
shall be pumped out at least once every five years, in accordance with the
provisions of the County Health Code. New septic tanks and private sewage
plants are not permitted.
      (6)   For any development or redevelopment, stormwater runoff shall be
controlled by the use of BMPs that achieve the following.
         (a)   For development, the post-development nonpoint source pollution
runoff load shall not exceed the predevelopment load, based on a Chesapeake Bay
watershed-wide average impervious surface cover of 16%.
         (b)   For any redevelopment site and for sites within IDAs, the
nonpoint source pollution load shall be reduced by at least 10%. The Zoning
Administrator may waive or modify this requirement for redevelopment sites that
originally incorporated BMPs for stormwater runoff quality control, provided
the following provisions are satisfied:
            1.   In no case may the post-development nonpoint source pollution
runoff load exceed the predevelopment load;
            2.   Runoff pollution loads must have been calculated and the BMPs
selected for the expressed purpose of controlling nonpoint source pollution;
and
            3.   If BMPs are structural, evidence shall be provided that
facilities are currently in good working order and performing at the design
levels of service. The Zoning Administrator may require a review of both the
original structural design and maintenance plans to verify this provision. A
new maintenance agreement may be required to ensure compliance with this
division (B)(6).
         (c)   For redevelopment, both the pre- and post-development loadings
shall be calculated by the same procedures. However, where the design data is
available, the original post-development nonpoint source pollution loadings can
be substituted for the existing development loadings.
      (7)   Prior to initiating grading or other on-site activities on any
portion of a lot or parcel, all wetlands permits required by federal, state,
and local laws and regulations shall be obtained and evidence of such submitted
to the Zoning Administrator, in accordance with §
157.161.
      (8)   Clearing, land disturbance, or development exceeding 500 square
feet on slopes 20% or greater is prohibited.
   (C)   Buffer area requirements.
      (1)   To minimize the adverse effects of human activities on the other
components of RPAs, state waters, and aquatic life, a 100-foot buffer area of
vegetation that is effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and
filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff shall be retained if present
and established where it does not exist. The delineation of the 100-foot RPA
boundary for the retention of an undisturbed and vegetated 100-foot-wide buffer
area with permissibility of only water dependent facilities or redevelopment
shall be shown on all plans and plats.
      (2)   The buffer area shall be located adjacent to and landward of other
RPA components and along both sides of any waterbody with perennial flow. The
full buffer area shall be designated as the landward component of the RPA, in
accordance with sections §
157.153 and
157.161.
      (3)   The 100-foot buffer area shall be deemed to achieve a 75% reduction
of sediments and a 40% reduction of nutrients.
      (4)   The buffer area shall be maintained to meet the following
additional performance standards.
         (a)   In order to maintain the functional value of the buffer area,
indigenous vegetation may be removed only, as permitted by the Zoning
Administrator, to provide for reasonable sight lines, access paths, general
woodlot management practices, including those that prevent upland erosion and
concentrated flows of stormwater and BMPs, as follows.
            1.   Trees may be pruned or removed as necessary to provide for
sight lines and vistas, provided that where removed, they shall be replaced
with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing
erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff.
            2.   Any path shall be constructed and surfaced to effectively
control erosion.
            3.   Dead, diseased, or dying trees or shrubbery and noxious weeds
may be removed and thinning of trees may be allowed pursuant to sound
horticulture practice as recommended by the town.
            4.   For shoreline erosion control projects, trees and woody
vegetation may be removed, necessary control techniques employed, and
appropriate vegetation established to protect or stabilize the shoreline in
accordance with the best available technical advice and applicable permit
conditions or requirements.
         (b)   When the application of the buffer areas would result in the
loss of a buildable area on a lot or parcel recorded prior to October 1, 1989,
the Zoning Administrator may allow encroachments into the buffer area in
accordance with §
157.161 and the following criteria.
            1.   Encroachments into the buffer areas shall be the minimum
necessary to achieve a reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and
necessary utilities.
            2.   Where practicable, a vegetated area that will maximize water
quality protection, mitigate the effects of the buffer encroachment, and is
equal to the area of encroachment into the buffer area shall be established
elsewhere on the lot or parcel.
            3.   The encroachment may not extend into the seaward 50 feet of
the buffer area.
         (c)   Redevelopment within IDAs may be exempt from the buffer area, in
accordance with §
157.161. Where possible a buffer area shall be provided in order to remove
pollutants and protect water quality. Any and all buffer exemptions are to be
granted by the Zoning Administrator.

         (b)   A minor assessment must demonstrate that the undisturbed buffer
area, enhanced vegetative plantings, and any required BMPs will result in
removal of no less than 75% of sediments and 40% of nutrients from post-
development stormwater runoff. It must also demonstrate that it will retard
runoff, prevent erosion, and filter nonpoint source pollution the equivalent of
the full undisturbed 100-foot buffer area. A minor assessment shall include a
site drawing to scale, which shows the following:
            1.   Location of the components of the RPA, including the 100-foot
buffer area;

OFF-STREET PARKING STANDARDS
§ 157.195 SCOPE OF SUBCHAPTER.
   The intent of this subchapter is to regulate off-street parking in all
zoning districts.
(1998 Code, § 66-228) (Ord. passed 9-5-2017)
§ 157.196 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Parking spaces shall be located on the same parcel as the principal
use. However, with approval of the Zoning Administrator, the required parking
may be provided on an adjacent or nearby parcel, provided a legally sufficient
easement is approved by the Town Attorney and recorded among the county land
records to ensure the perpetual availability of the parking spaces for the
principal use.
   (B)   No structure or site shall be altered in any manner that would enable
the structure or site to accommodate any increase in business capacity unless
the requirements of this subchapter are satisfied with respect to such
alteration and increase in capacity. Whenever a building or use is changed or
enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating
capacity, or otherwise, to create a need under the requirements of this
subchapter for an increase in parking spaces of 10% or more, such additional
spaces shall be provided on the basis of the change or enlargement. Under no
circumstances shall alterations to existing structures reduce existing parking
below that which would be required for the entire structure as altered.
   (C)   All off-street parking facilities shall be used solely for the parking
of vehicles by patrons, occupants, or employees of the use to which such
parking is accessory. No motor vehicle repair work, except emergency service,
no storage of merchandise, and no motor vehicles for sale, shall be permitted
in association with any required off-street parking facilities.
   (D)   Required off-street parking spaces may be provided cooperatively for
two or more uses, subject to arrangements that will assure the permanent
availability of such spaces to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator.
The amount of such combined space shall equal the sum of the amounts required
for the separate uses; however, the Zoning Administrator may reduce the total
number of parking spaces required by strict application of these requirements
when it can be determined the same spaces may adequately serve two or more uses
by reason of the hours of operation of such uses.
   (E)   If a question shall arise regarding the classification of a use for
application of this subchapter, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the
classification/basis of the number of spaces to be provided.
   (F)   Due to the unique character of existing structures and amenities in
the Old and Historic Occoquan District, the Zoning Administrator shall have the
authority to waive the requirements of §§
157.197 and
157.198 to approve nonstandard spaces.
   (G)   For the purposes of this section, net floor space is equal to 75% of
the gross floor area.

10.99
§ 157.197 REQUIRED PARKING.
   (A)   Residential uses: townhouse, multifamily, duplex, and single family
units:
      (1)   One bedroom unit: two spaces; and
      (2)   Units with two or more bedrooms shall have one additional parking
space per bedroom (i.e., three bedroom unit is required to have four parking
spaces).
   (B)   Business uses (other than places of assembly) require the following
spaces per 400 square feet (net floor space); except that in the Old and
Historic Occoquan District, the number of required spaces shall be one for each
800 square feet (net floor space) or portion thereof:
      (1)   Commercial: one space; and
      (2)   Office: one space.
   (C)   Places of assembly require one space per four seats; except that in
the Old and Historic Occoquan District, the required number of spaces shall be
one per eight seats or portion thereof; except that no parking spaces shall be
required for restaurants and places of assembly in the Old and Historic
Occoquan District with fewer than 50 seats. Restaurants and places of assembly
in the Old and Historic Occoquan District with more than 50 seats shall be one
for eight seats or portion thereof, the difference of the total number of seats
minus 50.
   (D)   Mixed use developments shall provide spaces in accordance with the
percentage of floor space devoted to each use.
   (E)   For uses not otherwise set forth in this section, parking spaces shall
be provided in sufficient quantity to accommodate the parking demand generated
by the proposed use as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   (F)   Parking areas shall be graded at a slope not to exceed 5%. Slope may
be up to 10%, with approval of the Town Engineer.
   (G)   Parking computations yielding fractional spaces of one-half and above
shall be rounded up to the next whole number, and fractional yields below one-
half shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
   (H)   Parking spaces expressly designated for compact cars may be provided.
Each space must be clearly marked by an above-grade sign. Such spaces shall not
constitute more than 30% of the entire parking space requirements and meet the

NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS, AND STRUCTURES
§ 157.210 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments that
may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and
structures that were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but
would be prohibited or restricted under the terms of this chapter or amendment.
It is the purpose of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue.
   (B)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in building plans if a permit for construction was issued
prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and where
actual building construction is carried on diligently. Where excavation or
demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be
deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on
diligently.

family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
except where specific limitations are imposed by other provisions of this
chapter. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district; provided that yard dimensions and requirements, other than those
applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations
for the district in which such lot is located.
(1998 Code, § 66-237) (Ord. passed 9-5-2017)
§ 157.212 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards,
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions.
   (A)   (1)   Such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered to an
extent not to exceed 20% of its original size.
      (2)   Such enlargement or alteration may be done only with approval from
the Zoning Administrator and only if such action shall not increase the degree
of nonconformance.
   (B)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed or damaged by any means, it may be reconstructed, but
not to an extent exceeding 50% of the current replacement cost of the original
structure and only if such reconstruction shall not increase the degree of
nonconformance.
   (C)   Where a nonconforming structure devoted to a nonconforming activity is
damaged less than 50% of the cost of reconstructing the entire structure, or
where a nonconforming structure is damaged less than 75% of the cost of
reconstructing the entire structure, either may be repaired or restored,
provided any such repair or restoration is started within 12 months and
completed within 18 months from the date of partial destruction.
   (D)   Should such structure be moved for any reason to another parcel of
land, regardless of distance, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations
for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
   (E)   Should any nonconforming structure be changed to a more limited
nonconforming use, such newly created use may be changed only to an even more
limited use.

section derives, obtain from the Zoning Administrator a nonconforming use
permit; and such nonconforming use, lot, or structure shall be recorded as part
of the records of the town.
   (B)   Whenever the boundaries of a district are changed, any uses of land or
buildings that become nonconforming as a result of such change shall be
recorded as part of the records of the town.

OUTDOOR LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS
§ 157.285 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purposes of the outdoor lighting regulations
are to protect dark skies and the general welfare by controlling the spillover
of light onto adjacent properties, and to prevent glare from outdoor luminaires
and limit the intensity of light on adjacent properties and roadways to further
public safety.
   (B)   Conformance with applicable codes and ordinances. All outdoor
artificial illuminating devices shall be installed in conformance with the
provisions of this subchapter, and applicable provisions of this chapter. The
most restrictive shall govern.
   (C)   General requirements.
      (1)   All outdoor light fixtures except those exempted by division (D)
below and those otherwise regulated by §
157.287 shall be fully shielded. A fully shielded fixture must be a full cutoff
luminaire or a decorative luminaire with full cutoff optics, and defined as an
outdoor lighting fixture that is shielded or constructed so that all light
emitted is projected below a horizontal plane running through the lowest part
of the fixture. The light source visibility shall be shielded from the
adjoining property (See Figures 1 and 2 in § 157.288).
      (2)   Spillover light, vertical or horizontal, shall not exceed one-half
foot-candles at the property line.
      (3)   Building- and pole-mounted luminaires shall not have adjustable
features.
   (D)   Exemptions. Exemptions include:
      (1)   Outdoor light fixtures installed prior to the effective date of
this subchapter are exempt from the provisions of this subchapter, provided,
however, that no change in use, increase in lumen output, or structural
alteration of outdoor light fixtures shall be made unless it thereafter
conforms to the provisions of this subchapter. Replacement of a fixture shall
mean a change of fixture type or change to the mounting height of location of a
fixture. Routine lighting fixture maintenance, such as changing lamps or light
bulbs, ballast, starter, photo control, and other similar components shall not
constitute replacement and shall be permitted provided such changes do not
result in a higher lumen output. Changing of housing or lenses in a fixture
shall not constitute an exemption to the requirements of this subchapter;
      (2)   Lighting required by state or federal law, to the extent that
compliance with state or federal law is inconsistent with compliance with this
subchapter;
      (3)   Roadway lighting and security lighting controlled and activated by
motion sensor devices for a duration of 15 minutes of less;
      (4)   Lighting of the U.S. or state flags and other noncommercial flags
expressing constitutionally-protected speech;
      (5)   Temporary circus, fair, carnival, or civic uses; and/or
      (6)   Construction and emergency lighting provided that said lighting is
temporary and is discontinued immediately upon completion of the construction
work or abatement of the emergency necessitating said lighting.

10.99
§ 157.286 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   FOOT-CANDLE. A quantitative unit of measure referring to the measurement of
illumination at a single point. One FOOT-CANDLE is equal to one lumen uniformly
distributed over an area of one square foot.
   FULL CUTOFF ANGLE. The angle formed by a line drawn from the light source
and a line perpendicular to the ground from the light source, beyond which no
light is emitted. (See Figure 1 in § 157.288.)
   FULLY SHIELDED. Fixtures that are shielded in such a manner that light
emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamp or indirectly from the
fixture, is projected below a horizontal plane running through the lowest point
on the fixture where light is emitted. This means that a FULLY SHIELDED fixture
is one used in a way that allows no direct or internally reflected light to
shine above the fixture. (See Figure 1 in § 157.288.)
   INITIAL LUMENS. The lumens emitted from a lamp as specified by the
manufacturer of the lamp.
   LAMP. The component of a luminaire that produces light. A LAMP is also
commonly referred to as a bulb.
   LUMEN. A standard unit of measurement referring to the amount of light
energy emitted by a light source without regard to the effectiveness of its
distribution.
   LUMINAIRE. A complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps together
with the components designed to distribute the light, to position and protect
the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply. A LUMINAIRE is also
commonly referred to as a fixture.
   OUTDOOR LIGHT. Outdoor artificial illuminating devices, outdoor fixtures,
lamps, or other fixture devices, permanent or portable, used for illumination,
direction, or advertisement. Such devices shall include, but are not limited
to, search, spot, or floodlights for: buildings and structures including
canopies and overhangs; recreational areas; parking lot lighting; landscape
lighting; signs, including billboards; and display and service areas.
   OUTDOOR LUMINAIRE. A luminaire which is permanently installed outdoors
including, but not limited to, devices used to illuminate any site, structure,
or sign.
   PHOTOMETRIC PLAN. A point by point plan depicting the intensity and location
of lighting on the property. (See Figure 4 in § 157.288.)
   TEMPORARY. Not used more than seven consecutive days and not used more than
15 days in any calendar year.
(1998 Code, § 66-351) (Ord. passed 9-5-2017)
§ 157.287 USE AND ZONING DISTRICT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Public or private outdoor recreational facilities. Outdoor night-time
recreational events have unique and site specific lighting needs. This section
is intended to permit adequate illumination for such events, while minimizing
sky-glow and reducing glare and lighting spillover onto surrounding streets and
properties.
      (1)   Primary playing areas with the exception of residential accessory
uses. Where playing fields or other recreational areas are to be illuminated,
lighting fixtures shall be specified, mounted, and aimed so that their beams
fall within the primary playing area. Direct illumination shall be confined to
within the property lines of the recreational use. External shields may be
required in order to reduce spillover light.
      (2)   Lighting plans. Lighting plans shall comply with special provisions
listed in §
157.288.
      (3)   Event hours. Under no circumstances shall any illumination of the
playing field, court, or track be permitted after 11:00 p.m. except to conclude
an event that was reasonably scheduled to conclude prior to 11:00 p.m. All
newly lighted fields, or existing fields being upgraded or refitted (public or
private) shall be equipped with override timing devices which will
automatically cut off the lights to ensure curfew compliance.
   (B)   Outdoor lighting of buildings, parking lots, loading areas, sales
areas, display areas, aprons/canopies, landscaping, signs, flags, statues, and
other objects. The following lighting requirements apply to single-family
attached, multifamily, educational, institutional, commercial recreation,
public, commercial business and retail, motor vehicle related, wholesaling, and
industrial uses identified in this chapter.
      (1)   Lighting of the aforementioned uses shall consist of fully cut-off
or directionally shielded lighting fixtures that are aimed and controlled so
that the directed light is confined to the object intended to be illuminated.
      (2)   Directional control shields shall be used where necessary to limit
stray light.
      (3)   No light from any illuminated sign shall cause or direct non-
reflected light from the fixture to shine onto any adjoining property or public
right-of-way.
      (4)   Lighting for all parking, display, and loading areas shall not
exceed an average horizontal illumination level of two and one-half foot-
candles. All lighting fixtures serving these areas shall be fully cut-off
fixtures.
      (5)   Maximum mounting height is 20 feet for residential uses and 25 feet
for nonresidential uses. Height is measured from the ground surface to the
bottom of the lighting fixture. (See Figure 3 in §
157.288.)
      (6)   The lighting fixture bulbs in aprons and canopies shall be recessed
into a canopy ceiling so that the bottom of the fixture is flush with the
ceiling so that light is restrained to no more than 85 degrees from vertical.
         (a)   As an alternative to recessed ceiling lights, indirect lighting
may be used where the light is directed upward and then reflected down from the
underside of the canopy. In this case, light fixtures shall be shielded so that
direct illumination is focused exclusively on the underside of the canopy.
         (b)   Lights shall not be mounted on the top or sides (facial) of the
canopy and the sides of the canopy shall not be illuminated.
      (7)   The lighting for pump islands and under canopies shall have a
minimum of one foot-candle at grade, and the average horizontal illumination
cannot exceed ten foot-candles at grade level, subject to a uniformity ratio
(ratio of average to minimum illuminance) no greater than four to one. The
standards herein are based on the Illuminating Engineering Society of America
(IESNA) RP-33, Lighting for Exterior Environments.
      (8)   Lamps shall not exceed 400 watts.
   (C)   Outdoor fixtures for single-family detached residential structures.
Outdoor fixtures for single-family detached residential structures shall be
limited to lamps with a maximum of 180 watts per fixture and shall be installed
so that light does not spill onto an adjoining property.

not limited to, manufacturers catalog cuts, and drawings including sections
where required; and
         (d)   A photometric plan indicating the minimum and maximum foot-
candle levels within the lighted area of the site. Such plan shall show
locations of all pole mounted and building mounted fixtures and a numerical 25
foot by 25 foot grid of lighting levels, in foot-candles, that the fixtures
will produce on the ground. (See Figure 4 below.)
      (3)   The required plans and descriptions shall be sufficiently complete
to enable the Planning Commission, Zoning Administrator, Building Official, or
their designee to readily determine compliance with the requirements of this
subchapter. If such plans and descriptions cannot enable this ready
determination by reason of the nature or configuration of the devices,
fixtures, or lamps proposed, the applicant shall submit evidence of compliance
by test reports performed by a testing lab certifying that the tests were
conducted according to the standards of the Illuminating Engineering Society of
North America (IESNA).
   (B)   Conformance with this subchapter.

SIGNS; GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.300 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT; INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The
purpose of this subchapter is to regulate the size, color, illumination,
movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on
private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of
property values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a
convenient, attractive, and harmonious community, protection against
destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas, and the safety and welfare
of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and
encouraging economic development. This subchapter allows adequate communication
through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location,
size, and purpose of all signs. This subchapter shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any
provision of this subchapter is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of
this subchapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision.
   (B)   Signs not expressly permitted as being allowed by right or by special
use permit under this subchapter, by specific requirements in another portion
of this chapter, or otherwise expressly allowed by the Town Council are
forbidden.
   (C)   A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of
identification, protection, or directing persons to a use conducted therein
shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the
principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this subchapter is
to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to
the land, building, or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for
their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests
identified in division (A) above.
   (D)   These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible
with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and
architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the
activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are
constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.
   (E)   These regulations distinguish between portions of the town designed
for primarily vehicular access and portions of the town designed for primarily
pedestrian access.
   (F)   These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual
speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the
town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are
most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above.
   (G)   These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may
be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an
appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of
visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms
caused by signs.

   (A)   Supports, uprights, or structures in determining sign area. Supports,
uprights, or structures on which any sign is supported shall not be included in

provisions.
   (B)   Sign area.
      (1)   Sign area is calculated under the following principles.
         (a)   With signs that are regular polygons or circles, the area can be

that are not regular polygons or circles, the sign area is calculated using all
that area within a maximum of three abutting or overlapping rectangles that
enclose the sign face.
         (b)   The permitted area of a double-faced sign shall be considered to
be the area on one side only. If one face contains a larger sign area than the
other, the larger face shall be used in calculating the sign area. A double-
faced sign must have an internal angle between its two faces of no more than 45
degrees.
         (c)   For projecting signs with a thickness of four inches or more,
the sign area also includes the area of the visible sides of the sign,
calculated as a rectangle enclosing each entire side view.

and in a safe, neat, and clean condition.
   (C)   The Building Official may take action under the State Maintenance
Code, after such notice as is provided by law, to address any sign which, in
his or her opinion, has become insecure, in danger of falling, or otherwise
unsafe, and, as such, presents an immediate threat to the safety of the public.
If such action is necessary to render a sign safe, the cost of such emergency
removal or repair shall be at the expense of the owner or lessee thereof as
provided in Chapters 92 and 150 of this code.
   (D)   Where the use or business has ceased operating, the owner of the sign
or property owner shall remove the sign within 60 days of the cessation of use
or business operation, or remove/replace the sign face with a blank face until
such time as a new use or business has resumed operating on the property.

reasonably good state of repair shall be put in a safe and good state of repair
within 30 days of a written notice to the owner and permit holder. Any sign

overhang any vehicular right-of-way.
   (B)   Illumination. All permitted signs may be indirectly lighted, unless
such lighting is specifically prohibited in this subchapter. Box signs may be
internally lighted.
      (1)   In the case of indirect lighting, the source shall be so shielded
that it illuminates only the face of the sign. However, wall signs shall be
indirectly illuminated or have shielded direct lighting, unless otherwise
prohibited within this chapter. Indirect lighting shall consist of full cut-off
or directionally shielded lighting fixtures that are aimed and controlled so
that the directed light shall be
substantially confined to the sign to minimize glare, sky glow, and light
trespass. The beam width shall not be wider than that needed to light the sign.
      (2)   Internal illumination shall be limited to the illumination
standards for outdoor lighting in §
157.287. No sign shall be permitted to have an illumination spread of more than
five-hundredths foot-candle at the lot line, shine into oncoming traffic,
affect highway safety, or shine directly into a residential dwelling unit. In
no event shall the illumination of any sign resulting from any internal or
external artificial light source exceed 100 lumens. All lighting fixtures used
to illuminate a sign shall be full-cutoff, as defined by the Illuminating
Engineering Society of North America (IESNA), and shall have fully shielded or
recessed luminaires with horizontal-mount flat lenses that prevent upward light
scatter and protect the dark night sky.
      (3)   All illumination for signs shall comply with provisions of §§
157.285 through
157.288.
   (C)   Waterfront signs. See chart in §§

a clearance of at least 12 inches from the edge of the store or building) or
sign pole. They must not obscure architectural features of the building (such
as windows, railings, or ornamentation) and shall not exceed 16 square feet in
total area. They may be hung in a horizontal or vertical manner and shall be
attached at all four corners in a taut manner.
      (3)   Temporary sign permits shall be for 20 consecutive days and no more
than twice in one calendar year per sign per business per parcel.
      (4)   Temporary signs installed and used for special events and festivals
sponsored by the town may be erected without a permit and shall be removed
within two days after the event.

ordinances, which do not conform to the provisions of this chapter, and signs
which are accessory to a nonconforming use shall be deemed to be nonconforming
signs and may remain except as qualified below. The burden of establishing
nonconforming status of signs and of the physical characteristics/location of
such signs shall be that of the owner of the property. Upon notice from the
Zoning Administrator, a property owner shall submit verification that sign(s)
were lawfully existing at time of erection. Failure to provide such
verification shall be cause for order to remove sign(s) or bring sign(s) into
compliance with the current ordinance.
   (B)   No nonconforming sign shall be enlarged nor shall any feature of a
nonconforming sign, such as illumination, be increased.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping in
good repair a nonconforming sign.
      (2)   Nonconforming signs shall not be extended or structurally
reconstructed or altered in any manner, except a sign face may be changed so
long as the new face is equal to or reduced in height and/or sign area.
   (D)   No nonconforming sign shall be moved for any distance on the same lot
or to any other lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform
in all respects to the provisions of this subchapter.
   (E)   (1)   A nonconforming sign that is destroyed or damaged by any
casualty to an extent not exceeding 50% of its area may be restored within two
years after such destruction or damage but shall not be enlarged in any manner.
      (2)   If such sign is so destroyed or damaged to an extent exceeding 50%,
it shall not be reconstructed but may be replaced with a sign that is in full
accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (F)   A nonconforming sign which is changed to becoming conforming or is
replaced by a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and
thereafter such sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this
subchapter.
   (G)   A nonconforming sign structure shall be subject to the provisions of §
157.212. In addition, a nonconforming sign structure shall be removed if the
use to which it is accessory has not been in operation for a period of two
years or more. Such sign structure shall be removed by the owner or lessee of
the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign structure, the
Zoning Administrator or designee shall give the owner 15 days' written notice
to remove it. Upon failure to comply with this
notice, the Zoning Administrator or designee may enter the property upon which
the sign is located and remove any such sign or may initiate such action as may
be necessary to gain compliance with this provision. The cost of such removal
shall be chargeable to the owner of the property.
