EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.041, 660.042 and 660.043
follow 660.04 and precede 660.05 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The 1980 Codified Ordinances of Loudoun County comprise
ordinances and resolutions enacted by the Board of Supervisors and new matter
ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. Sections and subsections of the 1980
Codified Ordinances without a history or with the words Adopting Ordinance at
the end thereof are new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance. In the

   (a)   This volume consists of all ordinances of a general and permanent
nature of the County, as revised, codified, arranged, numbered and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, and as such shall be known
and designated as the Codified Ordinances of Loudoun County, Virginia, 1980,
for which designation “Codified Ordinances” may be substituted. Code, title,
chapter and section headings do not constitute any part of the law as contained
in the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   All references to codes, titles, chapters and sections are to such
components of the Codified Ordinances unless otherwise specified. Any component
code may be referred to and cited by its name, such as the “Traffic Code.”
Sections may be referred to and cited by the designation “section” followed by
the number, such as “Section
202.01.”
202.02   AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS; NUMBERING.
   (a)   The Codified Ordinances of Loudoun County, Virginia, 1980, may be
amended or supplemented at any time and, when any amendment or supplement is
adopted in such form as to indicate the intention of the Board of Supervisors
to make the same a part thereof, such amendment or supplement shall be
incorporated in, and deemed a part of, the Codified Ordinances, so that a
reference to the Codified Ordinances shall be understood and construed as
including the Codified Ordinances and any and all such amendments and
supplements.
   (b)   All amendments and supplements enacted as a part of the Codified
Ordinances shall be integrated therewith by following the form of arrangement
and plan set forth in the original Codified Ordinances as follows: each
component code shall be subdivided into titles; each title shall be subdivided
into chapters, and each chapter shall be subdivided into sections, which shall
be numbered in accordance with the decimal numbering system. The numbering of
all sections, except penalty sections, shall be consecutive within each chapter
commencing with the first section of
Chapter 202, which shall be numbered 202.01, the first “2" signifying component
code 2, and the two figures “02" before the decimal signifying the chapter
within the component code, and the two figures “01" after the decimal
signifying the first section in
Chapter 202 of the component code. Penalty sections shall be designated “99"
and shall be the last section of a chapter.
202.03   REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing provision of the Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
   (b)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a provision of the Codified
Ordinances does not, except as provided in subsection (c) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
provision had not been repealed or amended.
   (c)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of a provision of the Codified Ordinances, the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed
according to the provision as amended.
202.04   DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION.
   In the construction of the Codified Ordinances, the following rules and
definitions shall control, excepting those inconsistent with the manifest
intent of the Board of Supervisors as disclosed in a particular provision,
section or chapter:
      (1)   Ordinance. “Adopting Ordinance” means the ordinance of the County
adopting these Codified Ordinances, in conformity with Section 15.2-1433 of the
Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended.
      (2)   Authority. Whenever in the Codified Ordinances authority is given
to an officer or an act is required to be performed, such authority may be
exercised and such act may be performed, at the instance of such officer, by a
deputy or subordinate, unless contrary to law or to the clear intent of any
such particular provision.

the legislative authority of the County.
      (4)   Calendar; Computation of Time. The terms “month” and “year” mean

in which case it shall be excluded and the time shall expire on the next week
day. If time is expressed in hours, the whole of Sunday shall be excluded.
      (5)   Conjunctions. “And” includes “or” and “or” includes “and,” if the

acquired a special meaning in the law shall be construed according to such
technical or special meaning.
      (9)   Joint Authority. Words giving authority to a board, commission or
authority or to three or more officers or employees or other persons shall be
construed as giving authority to a majority thereof, unless otherwise
specifically provided.

firms, associations, corporations, clubs and copartnerships, whether acting by
themselves or as a servant, agent or employee.

easements of an incorporeal nature.
      (12)   Number. Words in the plural include the singular and words in the

      (13)   Oath. “Oath” includes affirmation. When an oath is required or
authorized by law, an affirmation in lieu thereof may be taken by a person
having conscientious scruples about taking an oath. An affirmation shall have
the same force and effect as an oath.

joint owner or tenant in common of the whole or any part of such property.

      (18)   Reasonable Time. In all cases where provision is made for an act
to be done or notice to be given within a reasonable time, it shall be deemed
to mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance of such
act or the giving of such notice.
      (19)   Shall and May. “Shall” is mandatory; “may” is permissive.
      (20)   Sidewalk. “Sidewalk” means any portion of a street between the

buildings or land, shall extend and be applied to any person holding a written
or oral lease of, or who occupies the whole or any part of, a building or land,
alone or with others.
      (24)   Tenses. The use of any verb in the present tense includes the

202.05   SEPARABILITY OF PROVISIONS.
   Each section and each part of each section of the Codified Ordinances is
hereby declared to be an independent section or part of a section and
notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby declared
to be the controlling legislative intent that if any such section or part of a
section, or any provision thereof, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remaining sections or parts of
sections and the application of such provision to any other person or
circumstance, other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby, and it is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that
the Codified Ordinances would have been adopted independently of such section
or part of a section so held to be invalid.

page form, and to extract from the Codified Ordinances all provisions which may
be from time to time repealed by the Board of Supervisors or to make an
appropriate notation in the certified copy of the Codified Ordinances that such
provisions have been repealed. Such certified copy of the Codified Ordinances

portion of the certified copy of the Codified Ordinances, or insert or delete
pages or portions thereof, or alter or tamper with such Codified Ordinances in
any manner whatsoever, in such manner as to cause the law of the County to be
misrepresented. Whoever violates this section shall, in addition to the penalty
provided in Section 202. 99, be liable to the County, its officials or
employees, in law, equity or otherwise, for any damage or loss sustained by it,
them or any of them, because of an improper action or decision made by reason

triangles converging in the center of the Flag. The edging of the Flag consists
of green indentation with white or silver drops, suggesting milk drops. The
ermine fields contain nine green wheat symbols in each field. The Flag
represents the agricultural background of the County (the green color); the
Monroe Doctrine and President Monroe's association with the County (the
indented or “embattled” edging); and the dairy industry, still so important to
the County (the white or silver drops suggestive of milk). The Flag is on
display in the Board Room of the Board of Supervisors.

company or other merchant payment processor under the agreed upon contract with
the Treasurer, whichever is less.
    If any check, physical or electronic, credit/debit card transaction,

financial institution on which it is drawn, because of a) insufficient funds in
the account of the drawer, b) no account is in the name of the drawer, or c)
the account of the drawer is closed, and the check or other means of payment is
returned to the Treasurer unpaid, a forty dollars ($40) fee shall be added to

228.04   DISPOSITION OF UNCLAIMED PROPERTY.
   (a)   Short Title. This section shall be known and may be cited as the
“Loudoun County Unclaimed Property Disposition Ordinance.”
   (b)   Authority and Purpose. This section was passed pursuant to authority
granted under Sections 15.2-1719 and 15.2-1720 of the Code of Virginia of 1950,
as amended. The purpose of this section is to provide for the disposition of
unclaimed personal property and found property which has been in the possession
of the Sheriff and unclaimed for a period of more than sixty days.
   (c)   Definitions. As used in this section:
      (1)   “Unclaimed personal property” means any personal property, not
including contraband, belonging to another, which has been acquired by a law
enforcement officer pursuant to his or her duties, which is not needed in any
criminal prosecution, which has not been claimed by its rightful owner and
which the State Treasurer has indicated will be declined if remitted under the
Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (Section 55-210.1 et seq., Code
of Virginia).
      (2)   “Found property” means any personal property, not including
contraband, which has been found and delivered to the Sheriff or his or her
duly authorized agent, the owner of which cannot be identified, which has been
offered to the finder thereof but declined and which is not needed in any
criminal prosecution.
      (3)   “Notice” means, if the owner is known, written notice sent to such
owner, describing the personal property and requesting that such owner claim
such property, such notice to be sent by registered mail, return receipt
requested, to the owner's last known address. If the owner cannot be identified
after diligent inquiry, “notice” means a notice published at least once a week
for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the County,
stating that there will be a public sale of unclaimed personal property or
found property. Such property shall be described generally in the notice,
together with the date, time and place of the sale.
   (d)   Return of Found Property to Finders. When property has been found and
delivered to the Sheriff or his or her duly authorized agent by a private
person, and the owner of such property cannot be identified after sixty days
following publication, at least once a week for two successive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the County, of the location and description
of the found property, such finder shall be entitled to such found property. If
such finder declines the return of such property, the property shall be
disposed of in the same manner as unclaimed personal property.
   (e)   Sale or Donation. The Sheriff or his or her duly authorized agent is
hereby authorized to dispose of unclaimed personal property, which has been in
his or her possession for more than sixty days, by public sale. Prior to any
such sale, the Sheriff or his or her duly authorized agent shall make a
reasonable attempt to notify the rightful owner of the property, shall obtain
from the Commonwealth's Attorney, in writing, a statement advising that the
item is not needed in any criminal prosecution and shall cause to be published
in a newspaper of general circulation in the County notice of such transfer,
donation or sale, prior thereto. The sale of weapons shall be restricted to
licensed firearms dealers, on such terms as the Sheriff may establish,
consistent with accepted bidding procedures.
   (f)   Destruction of Property. The Sheriff or his or her duly authorized
agent is hereby authorized to destroy such property which otherwise would be
sold to the public pursuant to this section, if the Sheriff or his or her duly
authorized agent determines that such property has no resale value or could not
be sold. Property thus disposed of shall be accounted for in a manner to be
prescribed by the Sheriff.
   (g)   Distribution of Proceeds of Public Sale. The Sheriff or his or her
duly authorized agent shall pay from the proceeds of the sale the costs of
advertisement, removal, storage, investigation as to ownership and liens and
notice of the sale. The balance of funds shall be held by such officer for the
owner and paid to the owner upon satisfactory proof of ownership.
   If no claim supported by substantial proof of ownership has been made by the
owner for the proceeds of such sale within sixty days of the sale, the
remaining funds shall be deposited in the General Fund of the County. Any such
owner shall be entitled to apply to the County within three years from the date
of the sale, and, if timely application is made therefor, the County shall pay
the remaining proceeds of the sale to the owner, upon proof of ownership of the
sold property satisfactory to the Board of Supervisors, without interest or
other charges. No claim shall be made nor shall any suit, action or proceeding
be instituted for the recovery of such funds after three years from the date of
the sale.

an interview of the eligible employee as part of a formal inquiry or
investigation.
   (c)   Employees shall have the right to meet informally with County human
resources personnel or County management at the employee's request to discuss
any employment related or personal matter without the presence of the exclusive
bargaining representative. However, if the matter involves a subject governed
by the collective bargaining agreement, the matter shall be discussed with the
exclusive bargaining representative as soon as practicable without identifying

litigation or otherwise and as such, such communications on County email
systems are not considered private. The County's access to or disclosure of
emails required by law, for use in litigation or administrative hearings, for
use in investigations, or for other proper business or governmental purposes
shall not be considered a prohibited activity/unfair labor practice.
(Ord. 21-19. Passed 12-7-21.)
259.05   COUNTY AND BOARD OF SUPERVISORS RIGHTS.
   (a)   This chapter shall not be deemed in any way to limit or diminish the
authority of the Board of Supervisors to manage and direct the operations and
activities of the County to the fullest extent authorized and permitted by law.
Thus, unless the Board elects to bargain by resolution, the Board retains
exclusive rights, including, but not limited to, the right:
      (1)   To determine the organization of County government and the purpose
and mission of its constituent agencies, to set standards of service to be
offered to the public, and through its management officials to exercise control
and discretion over its organization and operations, provide for certain levels
of service, and add, delete, modify, or suspend programs, functions, divisions,
and departments as the Board or County Administrator determines to be necessary
and appropriate;
      (2)   To determine the type and scope of work to be performed by County
employees, the job descriptions for each County employee position, the manner
in which services are to be provided, and to determine the number of positions
or full-time equivalents (FTE) required;
      (3)   To introduce new or different services, methods, equipment, or
facilities;
      (4)   To determine the kind, type, location, and use of County-owned
equipment or facilities, provided that the County does not require the use or
operation of unsafe equipment or the unsafe operation of equipment;

      (6)   To do all things reasonable and necessary to carry out the mission
of the County;
      (7)   To retain the ability and authority to terminate probationary and
temporary employees in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 10
of the Human Resources Handbook;
      (8)   To require enhanced security measures to protect County facilities,

collective bargaining pertaining to individual employee safety, protection,
training, clothing, tools, tactics, or similar individual employee safety
measures.
      (9)   To determine the form of government utilized by the County.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement,
the County retains the right to take whatever actions may be necessary to carry
out the County's mission during a State of Emergency (as defined in Virginia
Code § 44-146.16) impacting Loudoun County, or a Declaration of Local Emergency
(as defined in Virginia Code § 44-146.16). In the event of a State of Emergency
or Declaration of Local Emergency where the duration of the impacts of the
emergency last for a period of more than six (6) months, the County will enter
into Impact Bargaining at the request of any certified representative after the
Declared Emergency is over. The purpose of the Impact Bargaining will be to
retroactively address impacts to the bargaining unit incurred during the
emergency. Merely having a Declaration of Emergency open for the reimbursement
of federal and state aid, absent continuing impacts, shall not count towards
the six month period.
   (c)   In accordance with Virginia Code § 40.1-57.2 and other applicable law,
nothing in this section or chapter or the terms of any collective bargaining
agreement, shall impair or restrict the authority of the Board of Supervisors
to establish its budget and appropriate funds in its discretion.
   (d)   No provision of this chapter shall act to interfere with or impair the
free speech and association rights of members of the Board of Supervisors. This
includes the right to advocate for or against employee organizations and to
speak on issues related to the County's labor policy without limitation. No
unfair labor practice may be brought against the County or a Board member
because of a Board member's or the Board's collective exercise of the right of
free speech and association.

involves a matter that could lead to discipline, and the employee requests
representation. The County shall inform all employees on a semi-annual basis
that employees have a right to union representation prior to the portion of any
such meeting or interview that involves a matter within the scope of bargaining
or a matter relating to discipline, and the employee shall have a right to
request union representation before proceeding with that portion of the meeting
or interview;
      (4)   To meet with individual employees on the premises of the employer
during the workday to investigate and discuss grievances, workplace-related
complaints, and other workplace issues, provided that such meetings do not
interfere with the work of the County. The County shall provide a location for
such meetings to be held;
      (5)   Official Time: Prior to the ratification of a collective bargaining
agreement, eligible employees representing an exclusive bargaining
representative directly involved in the negotiation of a CBA or the processing
of grievances under this chapter shall be authorized to engage in such
negotiations and grievance handling during work time. Such official time shall
be granted as set forth in a written agreement between the County and the
exclusive bargaining representative employees involved in the negotiation, and
the written agreement shall state such official time is reasonable, necessary,
and in the public interest.
      (6)   If no employee organization has been certified as the exclusive
representative, multiple employee organizations may be eligible to receive
regular and periodic dues payments.
      (7)   The County shall deduct and promptly remit dues for any employee
who has authorized dues deductions in accordance with this section.
      (8)   To be the only employee organization eligible to receive regular
and periodic dues payments deducted from the pay of employees by the County
pursuant to the employees' written authorizations. An authorization that
satisfies the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (Virginia Code § 59.1-479 et
seq.) shall be valid for employees' authorizations for payroll deductions.
   The requirements set forth in this section establish the minimum
requirements for access to and communication with bargaining unit employees by
an exclusive bargaining representative. These requirements shall not prevent
the County from granting the exclusive bargaining representative greater access
to or communication with employees and shall not prevent the parties from
negotiating for increased access.
(Ord. 21-19. Passed 12-7-21.)
259.07   EMPLOYEE BARGAINING UNITS.
   (a)   Fire and rescue. The fire and rescue employees' bargaining unit shall

marshal employees and public safety communications employees, except those
excluded by definition in section
259.03 ;
   (b)   Labor and trades. Those eligible employees in positions associated
with maintenance and skilled crafts, to include employees performing duties
related to the maintenance of the capital assets, land, and infrastructure of
the County, the operation of heavy equipment or large, heavy, or placarded
hazardous material vehicles, or the disposal of waste, except those excluded by
definition in section

   (c)   General government. All other County employees except those excluded
from collective bargaining by definition in section
259.03 .
(Ord. 21-19. Passed 12-7-21.)
259.08   LABOR RELATIONS ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   A labor relations administrator (LRA) shall be selected in the manner
set forth in subsection (b) of this section to administer provisions of this
chapter including the process for certification and decertification of
exclusive bargaining representatives, resolving labor-management disputes as
defined in this chapter, and assisting with the selection of mediator(s) and/or
arbitrator(s) as needs arise under this chapter or under any collective
bargaining agreement. The LRA shall serve as a neutral party.
   (b)   Qualifications; selection and removal of LRA; appointment of interim
neutral.
      (1)   The LRA must be experienced as a neutral in the field of labor
relations, and must not be a person who, because of vocation, employment, or
affiliation, can be categorized as a representative of the interest of the
County or any employee organization, including an exclusive bargaining
representative for a bargaining unit permitted under this chapter.
      (2)   The selection of the LRA will be conducted through the County's
standard request for proposal (RFP) process, in accordance with the Virginia
Public Procurement Act ("VPPA"). The Proposal Analysis Group (PAG) will consist
of either (a) representatives of those employee organizations that have
notified the County Administrator or County Administrator's designee of their
interest in representing bargaining units permitted by this chapter, if no
exclusive bargaining representatives have been recognized at the time the
selection process begins, or (b) by the exclusive bargaining representatives of
the bargaining units permitted by this chapter, and an equal number of County
representatives.
      (3)   The PAG shall review and rank all proposals received and recommend
up to three applicants from the highest-ranking proposals. The PAG shall
present its recommendations to the Board upon formal Board request. Final
approval of the LRA shall be made by the Board of Supervisors from the list
recommended by the PAG.
      (4)   The LRA shall serve for a term of three years. Before the
expiration of the LRA's term, the parties shall begin the RFP process with
enough time to ensure that the LRA is reappointed, or a new LRA is appointed,
as soon as the incumbent LRA's term expires.
      (5)   The LRA's services shall be subject to termination by majority
agreement of the County and the exclusive bargaining representatives of the
bargaining units permitted by this chapter. If no exclusive bargaining
representatives have been certified, then the LRA's services shall be subject
to termination by mutual agreement of the County and a majority of those
employee organizations that have submitted a showing of interest petition.
      (6)   If a petition is filed requesting certification of an exclusive
bargaining representative, a party seeks to file an unfair labor practice
claim, or some other labor management dispute arises there is no LRA serving at
the time, then the parties shall bring the certification petition or dispute to
a mutually agreed upon interim neutral. The interim neutral may be an
individual chosen through the ranking/striking process of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") or Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
("FMCS"). If the LRA dies, resigns, is terminated, becomes disabled, or
otherwise becomes unable or ineligible to continue to serve, the County and
exclusive bargaining agent(s) may mutually select an interim neutral as needed
while the County conducts a full competition for a new LRA in accordance with
subsection (b)(2).
         Alternatively, the County may use an LRA from another Virginia
locality available through the VPPA's joint and cooperative procurement
provision.
   (c)   Duties of the LRA. The LRA shall:
      (1)   Establish standardized procedures consistent with this chapter and
applicable law for submission and adjudication of petitions, elections,
certification and decertification, and other processes needed for the efficient
operation of collective bargaining under this chapter. Including for the timing
and standards for public notifications and announcements for timely
participation in the activities under this chapter.
      (2)   Supervise elections for certification or decertification of
exclusive bargaining representatives and issuing the certification or
decertification. This includes making proper public notices related to
petitions, certifications, and elections in accordance with County requirements
for public notifications and announcements.
      (3)   Monitor and record key dates and milestones pertaining to
initiation, progress, and completion of collective bargaining negotiations for
purposes of making proper public notifications and announcements and
facilitating the full exercise of the rights of the County, employees, and
employee organizations under this chapter.
      (4)   Hold hearings and make inquiries, administer oaths and
affirmations, examine witnesses and documents, take testimony, receive
evidence, request the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant
documents in proceedings within the responsibility of the LRA. The County and
employee organizations have a duty to comply with reasonable requests for
information submitted by the LRA.
      (5)   Investigate and attempt to resolve or settle, charges of either the
County or an employee organization engaging in prohibited practices as defined
in this chapter, as provided in section
259.11 Labor-Management Dispute Resolution.
      (6)   Determine unresolved issues of employee inclusion in or exclusion
from the defined bargaining units in this chapter, including challenges to
validity of individual signatures on petitions for recognition or
decertification.
      (7)   Obtain any necessary support services and make necessary
expenditures in the performance of duties, subject to reimbursement procedures
established in the terms and conditions of the contract for LRA services with
the County.
      (8)   Determine any issue regarding the negotiability of any collective
bargaining proposal.
      (9)   Exercise any other powers and perform any other duties and
functions specified in this chapter of an administrative nature.
      (10)   Keep and maintain accurate and complete records of activities,
communications, information, reports, decisions, etc. in accordance with County
recordkeeping requirements.
(Ord. 21-19. Passed 12-7-21.)
259.09   RECOGNITION OF EXCLUSIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE.
   (a)   There can be only one exclusive bargaining representative for each
recognized employee bargaining unit.
   (b)   Request for certification/decertification.
      (1)   Any employee organization seeking recognition as the exclusive
bargaining representative of a bargaining unit must submit a request for
certification to the LRA that includes a showing of interest petition signed by
not less than thirty percent of the eligible employees in that unit. The LRA
shall determine the sufficiency of the petition within ten days. If the LRA
determines after a tabulation of the submitted petition that the union has not
met the required showing of interest, then the LRA must allow not less than
thirty days for the union to submit additional showing of interest forms to
correct the insufficient showing of interest. The thirty-day period for
calculating the time to submit additional showing of interest forms commences
after the LRA provides notice to the union that the union has not met the
required showing of interest.
      (2)   A showing of interest petition may consist of a combination of
signed membership cards, or a membership roster signed by each employee,
evidence of dues payment, or other evidence of bargaining unit employees'
desire to be represented by an employee organization for collective bargaining
purposes, including but not limited to authorization cards or petition
signatures. An authorization that satisfies the Uniform Electronic Transactions
Act shall be valid for employees' authorization for representation for purposes
of a petition filed by an employee organization for exclusive representation.
      (3)   Any eligible employee of a bargaining unit may submit a request for
decertification of the exclusive bargaining representative by submitting a
petition signed by not less than thirty percent of the eligible employees in
the bargaining unit.
      (4)   Requests for decertification may be filed not less than one year
after the date the existing representative was certified; however, if a
collective bargaining agreement is in effect, such petition must be filed
within the thirty-day (30) period between the one hundred eightieth (180th) and
one hundred fiftieth (150th) day before the expiration date of the collective
bargaining agreement prior to the original expiration date, regardless of any
extensions, of the collective bargaining agreement. If a collective bargaining
agreement expires and a successor agreement is not in place, a request for
decertification may be filed at any time prior to the ratification of a
successor agreement.
      (5)   The effect of a successful decertification election for the
bargaining unit takes effect immediately upon final certification of the
election results by the LRA. If the election results in a new exclusive
representative, the new representative shall become a successor in interest to
the existing or prior collective bargaining agreement. If the election results
in no exclusive representative, the result will act as a revocation of any
existing collective bargaining agreements for the bargaining unit.
   (c)   Election process.
      (1)   Upon determination of adequate support for a request of
certification or decertification, the LRA will provide public notification of
the request. Any additional interested employee organization must submit a
petition of intervention to the LRA, which must be accompanied by a showing of
interest petition signed by not less than thirty percent of the employees in a
recognized bargaining unit within ten days of notice of the pending election.
      (2)   The LRA will establish procedures for a secret, mail-ballot
election in consultation with the County and any employee organizations,
individuals, and/or intervening parties seeking certification or
decertification. The election may take place by an alternate method if agreed
by the parties. The election will begin not more than forty-five days after the
LRA issues a finding of sufficiency.
      (3)   A simple majority of valid ballots cast will determine the results
of any election. In an election that presents a choice of more than one
employee organization, all votes cast indicating a preference for a labor
organization will be construed as a vote in favor of certifying an exclusive
bargaining representative. If a majority of votes favor certifying an exclusive
bargaining representative, but no one organization receives a majority, then a
run-off election will be held by the two labor organizations receiving the most
votes. The organization receiving the majority of votes in the run-off shall
prevail.
      (4)   Recognition of the exclusive bargaining representative is valid
from initial certification unless the exclusive bargaining representative is
decertified.
      (5)   No certification election shall be held within six months of a vote
of no representation for elections held on or before May 1, 2022, or within
twelve months of an election resulting in a vote of no representation
thereafter, except as may be ordered as a remedy by the LRA.
(Ord. 21-19. Passed 12-7-21.)
259.10   GOOD FAITH BARGAINING, SUBJECTS OF BARGAINING, AND IMPASSE RESOLUTION.
   (a)   The County and an exclusive bargaining representative shall have the
duty to bargain in good faith for the purpose of entering into a collective
bargaining agreement. All collective bargaining shall occur only between the
parties' respective designated representatives.
   (b)   The County or the exclusive bargaining representative may initiate a
request to bargain by submitting a written request to the other party or the
LRA. Within ten business days from the receipt of the request, the parties'
designated representative(s) shall mutually agree upon and schedule dates and
times to meet.
   (c)   Collective bargaining shall be conducted in accordance with the rules
established by the parties' representatives at the commencement of the process.
All discussions will be conducted in a professional and courteous manner.
   (d)   Nothing in this chapter requires either party to make any concessions
or agree to the other party's proposals.
   (e)   In any year in which the County and an exclusive bargaining
representative bargain collectively, the parties shall jointly select a neutral
who shall, if necessary, serve as a mediator and/or arbitrator. The neutral may
be the LRA, or the parties may select a different neutral. If the parties do
not agree on a neutral, then they shall request a list of neutrals from an
impartial agency (AAA or FMCS) and use that agency's process selecting a
neutral. The neutral must be selected within ninety days of the start of
bargaining and must be available during the bargaining process. Fees and
expenses of the neutral shall be shared equally by the County and an exclusive
bargaining representative.
   (f)   Subjects of bargaining.
      (1)   Mandatory subjects of bargaining shall include wages, benefits, and
working conditions, unless specifically identified as a prohibited subject in
this chapter.
      (2)   All other labor related subjects are permissive subjects of
bargaining.
   (g)   Mediation and declaration of impasse.
      (1)   Mediation:
         A.   During collective bargaining, if the parties cannot reach
agreement on any issue, either party may declare their intent to file for
mediation with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the LRA and
the opposing party.
         B.   A bona fide impasse exists if the selected neutral finds that the
parties are unable to resolve any remaining issues 30 days after commencement
of the mediation process.
      (2)   CBA Impasse Procedure:
         A.   If an impasse is declared, the parties will submit to
arbitration/factfinding. Unresolved non-financial issues shall be resolved via
binding arbitration; unresolved financial issues shall be resolved via non-
binding factfinding.
         B.   Parties are to submit a copy of proposals for each unresolved
issue to be considered by the neutral, all settled matters, and relevant
information and data supporting the parties' proposed resolutions. The neutral
may hold a hearing for oral arguments on, and/or permit each party to respond
to or rebut the competing proposals.
         C.   The neutral shall issue a written determination that contains
findings of facts and recommendations for settlement of the unresolved items.
The neutral shall issue a determination no more than forty-five days after the
initiation of impasse proceedings. In making a determination under this
subsection, the neutral must consider at least the following factors:
            1.   Past collective bargaining agreements between the parties,
including the past bargaining history that led to the agreements, or the pre-
collective bargaining history of employee wages, benefits, and working
conditions.
            2.   Comparison of wages, benefits, and working conditions of
similar employees of other public employers in the Capitol Metro Region defined
as Loudoun County, Arlington County, Alexandria City, Prince William County,
and Fairfax County, Montgomery County (MD), Frederick County (MD) Prince
George's County (MD), the District of Columbia, and incorporated cities and
towns wherein.
            3.   Comparison of working conditions of other Loudoun County
personnel.
            4.   The interest and welfare of the public.
            5.   The effect of the adjustments on the standard of public
services provided by the employer.
         D.   For non-fiscal items, the written determination made by the
neutral shall be integrated with all previously agreed on items in the
collective bargaining agreement. The written determination regarding fiscal
items, shall go to the Board for a determination. If the Board approves the
fiscal items, then they are included in the collective bargaining agreement.
   (h)   Any tentative collective bargaining agreement that affects the Board's
budget process and
is intended to begin at the start of the upcoming fiscal year must be received
by the Board for consideration by December 1.
   (i)   Approval of tentative agreement.
      (1)   When the parties reach a tentative agreement, they shall reduce it
to writing and the parties' representatives shall execute it with the
appropriate signatures.
      (2)   The executed tentative agreement is then submitted to the exclusive
bargaining representative for ratification in accordance with the bargaining
representative's governing/ratification procedures. Upon the exclusive
bargaining representative's ratification, the tentative agreement will be
submitted to the Board of Supervisors for approval. No collective bargaining
agreement shall have any force or effect until final action on the agreement is
taken by the Board.
      (3)   Approval of the tentative agreement by the Board shall serve to
signify the Board's good faith commitment to appropriate the funding necessary
for the County to meet its obligation under the tentative agreement as part of
the County's budget approval process.
      (4)   If the exclusive bargaining representative of either party does not
ratify the tentative agreement, or the Board does not approve the agreement,
the parties must reopen negotiations, with the good faith objective to
negotiate provisions that will be acceptable to the parties.
(Ord. 21-19. Passed 12-7-21.)
259.11   LABOR-MANAGEMENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   (a)   Disputes concerning the interpretation, administration, and
application of this chapter, including but not limited to petition and election
matters, negotiability of subjects of bargaining, charges of unfair or
prohibited labor practices, shall be submitted to the LRA as the exclusive
resolution process, unless otherwise noted in this chapter. Findings of the LRA
shall be considered as a final award of an arbitrator in accordance with the
Virginia Uniform Arbitration Act, Virginia Code Section 8.01-581.01 et. seq,
and final determinations of the LRA involving interpretations of this chapter
may be appealed to the Loudoun County Circuit Court.
   (b)   Disputes concerning the administration or interpretation of a
collective bargaining agreement will be resolved using the dispute resolution
processes defined in the agreement including the use of mediation factfinding,
and binding arbitration. A negotiated grievance procedure contained in a
collective bargaining agreement shall be the exclusive procedure available to
an employee of the bargaining unit covered by that agreement unless another
procedure is available as a matter of right provided by state law. Where such
alternate procedures are available, an employee's initial election of procedure
made at the time of filing the grievance shall be irrevocable.
   (c)   The parties shall share the costs of dispute resolution processes
equally, other than the costs for those matters resolved by the LRA.
   (d)   The limitations period for filing an unfair labor practice claim shall
be six months from the event leading to the claim. The limitations period for
all other claims shall be as set forth in the CBA.

   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Pursuant to the Virginia Water and Sewer Authorities Act
(Title 15.1, Chapter 28, now the Virginia Water and Waste Authorities Act,
Title 15.2, Chapter 51, of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended), the
Loudoun County Sanitation Authority was created by a Resolution of the Board of
Supervisors passed May 4, 1959, for the purpose of acquiring, constructing,
operating and maintaining an integrated water system for supplying and
distributing water in the County, and an integrated sewerage system and sewage
disposal system for the County, and for the purpose of exercising the powers
conferred by such Act in relation to the foregoing.
   The Articles of Incorporation of the Authority were amended by a Resolution
of the Board passed May 18, 1965, and were again amended and restated by a
Resolution of the Board passed February 2, 1976.)
260.02   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Pursuant to the Industrial Development and Revenue Bond Act
(Title 15.1, Chapter 33, now Title 15.2, Chapter 49, of the Code of Virginia of
1950, as amended), the Industrial Development Authority of Loudoun County,
Virginia, was created by an Ordinance of the Board of Supervisors passed March
5, 1974. Ordinance 83-03, passed February 22, 1983, ratified the creation of
the Industrial Development Authority, required approval by the Board of
Supervisors of bonds issued by the Authority and imposed restrictions on the
use of bond proceeds. Ordinance 83-03, as amended in 1984, 1998 and 2013, is
set forth in full below. By ordinance adopted on June 5, 2013, the Board of
Supervisors changed the name of the “Industrial Development Authority of
Loudoun County, Virginia” to the “Economic Development Authority of Loudoun
County, Virginia.”)
   (a)   Creation of Authority.
       (1)   By this section, there is affirmed and ratified the creation of a
political subdivision of the Commonwealth, with such public and corporate
powers as are set forth in the Industrial Development and Revenue Bond Act,
constituting Chapter 33 of Title 15.1, now Chapter 49 of Title 15.2, of the
Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, except as such powers are limited herein.
      (2)   The name of the political subdivision so created shall be the
Economic Development Authority of Loudoun County, Virginia, hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the Authority. The Economic Development Authority of
Loudoun County, Virginia shall be considered for all purposes a continuation of
the political subdivision created in 1974 and formerly named the Industrial
Development Authority of Loudoun County, Virginia. The powers, assets, duties
and obligations of the Industrial Development Authority of Loudoun County,
Virginia, shall continue under the name “Economic Development Authority of
Loudoun County, Virginia.”
      (3)   The Board of Supervisors hereby reserves the right to limit the
type and number of facilities which the Authority might otherwise finance
through bond issues.
   (b)   Requirements for Approval of Tax Exempt Industrial Development Bonds.
       (1)   All tax exempt industrial development bonds issued by the
Authority shall be approved by the Board of Supervisors. As used herein, “tax
exempt" means, with respect to any bond (or issue), that the interest on such
bond (or on the bonds issued as part of such issue) is excluded from gross
income for purposes of federal income taxation.
       (2)   In furtherance of the purposes of this section, the following
requirements (in addition to any requirements under applicable federal and
state law) shall apply to the issuance of any tax exempt industrial development
bond by the Authority:
         A.   The Authority shall give public notice of its intent to issue an
industrial development bond and shall advertise the same for public hearing
once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation
in the County. The hearing shall occur not less than six days nor more than
twenty-one days after the second advertisement has appeared in such newspaper.
         B.   After conducting a public hearing on the matter, the Authority
shall notify the County Administrator of its intent to issue an industrial

incident related to such violation:
      (1)   The provisions of Sections 18.2-51.4, 18.2-266, or 29.1-738 of the
Code of Virginia, or a similar ordinance, when such operation of a motor
vehicle, engine, train or watercraft while so impaired is the proximate cause
of the accident or incident;
      (2)   The provisions of Article 7 (Sections 46.2-852 et seq.) of Chapter
8 of Title 46.2 of the Code of Virginia, relating to reckless driving, when

costs of providing law-enforcement, firefighting, rescue, and emergency medical

incident not involving impaired driving, operation of a vehicle or other
conduct as set forth herein.

440.02   UNLAWFUL RIDING.
   No person shall ride on any vehicle upon any portion thereof not designed or

employee engaged in the necessary discharge of a duty or to persons riding
within truck bodies in space intended for merchandise.
440.03   SOLICITING EMPLOYMENT OR BUSINESS.
   No person shall stand in the vehicular traveled portion of any highway or
road for the purpose of soliciting employment or business from the occupant of
any vehicle.
440.04   INTERFERENCE WITH TRAFFIC PROHIBITED.
   (a)   Policy. Allowing transactions in which items are exchanged between
pedestrians and the occupants of motor vehicles operating in the travel/traffic
lanes of highways in the County is inherently dangerous, is distracting to both
pedestrians and motorists, threatens the safety and well-being of the
pedestrian and vehicle operators/occupants, interferes with the free flow of
traffic and potentially threatens third parties in the vicinity. The traffic/
travel lanes of County highways in which motor vehicles are present and
operating are not designed for and are not appropriate locations for anything
other than travel. It is the policy of the Board of Supervisors to minimize
such potentially dangerous situations by narrowly tailoring the restrictions
enumerated herein to serve the County’s substantial interest in protecting the
public health, safety and welfare of County citizens and visitors.
   (b)   Definitions. As used in this chapter:
      (1)   “Highway” shall mean the entire width between the boundary lines of
every way or place open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular
traffic in the County, including the streets and alleys, and the entire width
between the boundary lines of all private roads or private streets that have
been designated as highways pursuant to Section
420.03.
      (2)   “Item” includes any physical object.
      (3)   “Motor vehicle” shall have the same meaning as defined in § 46.2-
100 of the Code of Virginia, as amended.
   (c)   Prohibition. No pedestrian or operator/occupant of a motor vehicle
shall exchange or attempt to exchange any item while such motor vehicle is
located in a traffic or travel lane on a County highway, except as otherwise
provided in this section.
   (d)   Exceptions.
      (1)   This section shall not apply to the distribution, receipt or
exchange of any item with an occupant of a motor vehicle parked on private
property or parked in a public parking area.
      (2)   This section shall not apply to any law enforcement officer acting
within the scope of his/her official duties.
      (3)   This section shall not apply to the distribution, receipt, or
exchange of any item with the occupant of a motor vehicle located on a highway
after a motor vehicle accident, or to assist the occupant of a disabled motor
vehicle, or to assist a pedestrian or motor vehicle occupant experiencing a
medical emergency.
   (e)   Penalties. Any pedestrian or operator/occupant of a motor vehicle who
violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a traffic
infraction.

a person or animal or damage a vehicle upon such highway, or throw or deposit

490.04   CRITERIA FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW DISTRICTS OR AMENDMENT OF

   (a)   The Board may establish a Residential Permit Parking District
encompassing an area within half-mile (2,640 foot) walking distance from the
pedestrian entrances of an existing or proposed high school or University
Campus or College or proposed rail or metro-rail station if:
      (1)   The Board receives a petition requesting the establishment of such
a District; and
      (2)   Such petition contains signatures representing at least seventy-
five percent (75%) of the eligible residential addresses of the proposed
District and more than sixty percent (60%) of the eligible residential
addresses on each block of the proposed District or, in the case of public-
street or private street attached single-family/town home dwelling units, such
petition must contain signatures representing at least sixty percent (60%) of
the eligible addresses as defined in Section
490.05;
   (b)   The Board may establish a District in any residential area of the
County upon receipt of a petition representing at least seventy-five percent
(75%) of the eligible residential addresses of the proposed District and more
than sixty percent (60%) of the eligible residential addresses on each block of
the proposed District upon a determination that:
      (1)   The proposed District contains a minimum of one hundred (100)
contiguous or nearly contiguous on-street parking spaces, either marked or
unmarked open curb type parking, twenty (20) linear feet in length per space;
and
      (2)   At least seventy-five percent (75%) of the land abutting each block
within the proposed District is developed residential; and
      (3)   At least seventy-five percent (75%) of the total number of on-
street parking spaces of the petitioning blocks are occupied by vehicles, with
at least fifty percent (50%) of those spaces occupied by nonresidents of the
petitioning blocks, as authenticated by a survey taken during the hours of peak
demand as determined on a District-by-District basis. Should more than one year
(365 days) have passed from the issuance date of such petition to the date of
completion of requirements (1) and (2) above, at the Department’s discretion, a
new petition may be required.
   The Board may waive the requirement for one hundred (100) contiguous or
nearly contiguous on-street parking spaces as set forth above if the Board
finds that the proposed District meets the purpose and intent of this Chapter.
   (c)   The Board may amend the provisions of an existing District, including
Temporary Residential Permit Parking District, by utilizing the same criteria
and procedures as those for the establishment of a new District. In the case of
an amendment expanding an existing District, however, the provisions of this
Section 490.04 shall apply only to the area to be added to the existing
District, and the area to be added to an existing District need not contain a
minimum of one hundred (100) contiguous or nearly contiguous on-street parking
spaces.
   (d)   If the criteria listed in terms (a) through (c) are not met within one
year (365 days) from the petition requesting the establishment of a new
District, then the residents of the proposed District shall wait one calendar
year (365 days) before submitting another petition for a District on the
requested blocks, unless the Department, at its own discretion, waives such
restriction on a case-by-case basis.
   (e)   A Temporary Residential Parking Permit District may be created by the
Board when a residential area abutting a public street is experiencing or
expects to experience significant parking problems due to a short-term
situation, such as a construction project or event. Short-term situations
shall, at a minimum, be estimated of at least six months (180 days) duration.
An application for a Temporary Residential Parking Permit District shall be
submitted in writing to the Board from all affected homeowner associations that
represent the affected residential area or, in cases where there are no
homeowner associations representing an area, a written petition signed by at
least sixty percent (60%) of the eligible residential addresses on each block
of the proposed District. No Temporary Residential Parking Permit District may
be created with less than ten (10) affected homeowners.

   The provisions of this section shall not apply to a licensed business which
is regularly engaged in business as an automobile dealer, salvage dealer or

(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.05   NOTICE TO OWNER TO REMOVE; NONCOMPLIANCE; REMEDY OF COUNTY.
   (a)   Upon reasonable belief that there is on residential, agricultural or
commercial property in the County one or more inoperable vehicles, as defined
in Section
602.03, the Sheriff shall issue a written notice, by certified mail, to the
owner of the premises, directing him or her to either bring such vehicle into

of receipt of the written notice.
   (b)   In the case of failure by the owner of the premises to respond to the

the premises, remove and dispose of the inoperable vehicle.
   (c)   The cost of the removal and disposal of said vehicle may be charged to

(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.06   IMPOUNDING.
   The Sheriff may take into custody any abandoned motor vehicle. In such

storing abandoned motor vehicles.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.07   NOTICE TO OWNER OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLE.
   (a)   Whenever the Sheriff takes into custody an abandoned motor vehicle, he
or she shall notify, within fifteen days thereof, by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the motor vehicle and
all persons having security interests therein of record, that the vehicle has
been taken into custody. The notice shall describe the year, make, model and
serial number of the abandoned motor vehicle, set forth the location of the
facility where the motor vehicle is being held, inform the owner and any person
having a security interest of their right to reclaim the motor vehicle within
fifteen days after the date of the notice, upon payment of all towing,
preservation and storage charges resulting from placing the vehicle in custody,
and state that the failure of the owner or persons having security interests to
exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle within the time provided shall be
deemed a waiver by the owner, and all persons having security interests, of all
right, title and interest in the vehicle, and consent to the sale of the
abandoned motor vehicle at a public auction.
   (b)   If records of the State Department of Motor Vehicles contain no
address for the owner or no address of any person shown by such records to have
a security interest, or if the identity and addresses of the owner and all
persons having security interests cannot be determined with reasonable
certainty, notice by publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in
the area where the motor vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient to meet all
requirements of notice pursuant to this chapter as to any person who cannot be
notified pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) hereof. Such notice by
publication may contain multiple listings of abandoned motor vehicles. Any such
notice shall be within the time requirements prescribed for notice by mail and
shall have the same contents required for a notice by mail.
   (c)   The consequences and the fact of failure to reclaim an abandoned motor
vehicle shall be as set forth in a notice given in accordance with and pursuant
to this section.
   (d)   The notice shall also advise the owner of record of his or her right
to contest the determination by the Sheriff that the motor vehicle was
“abandoned,” as defined in this chapter, by requesting a hearing before the
County Administrator in writing. Such written request for a hearing must be
made within fifteen days of the date of the notice.
   Upon receipt of a request for a hearing pursuant to this section, the County
Administrator or his or her designee shall set a hearing date, giving written
notice thereof to the person requesting such hearing. A request for a hearing
shall operate to stay all enforcement proceedings until a decision by the
Administrator or his or her designee is reached. The owner of record may
present relevant evidence and may call witnesses at such hearing.
   (e)   The Administrator or his or her designee shall determine at such
hearing either that the vehicle or vehicles in question were “abandoned,” as
defined in this chapter, or that such vehicle or vehicles were not “abandoned”
when taken into custody. The Administrator or his or her designee shall issue a
written order, containing findings of fact and his or her decision.
   If the vehicle or vehicles are found to have been not “abandoned” under the
terms of this chapter, they shall be returned to the owner without charge for
towing, storage or removal.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.08   SALE OF VEHICLE AT PUBLIC AUCTION; DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS.

provided for in Section
602.07, the Sheriff shall sell the abandoned motor vehicle at public auction.
The purchaser of the motor vehicle shall take title to the motor vehicle free
and clear of all liens and claims of ownership of others, shall receive a sales
receipt at the auction and shall be entitled to, upon application therefor to
the proper State authorities, a certificate of title and a registration card
therefor. The sales receipt at such a sale shall be sufficient title only for
purposes of transferring the vehicle to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking
or dismantling and, in such case, no further titling of the vehicle shall be
necessary. From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle, the
County shall reimburse itself for the expenses of the auction, the cost of
towing, preserving and storing the vehicle which resulted from placing the
abandoned motor vehicle in custody, and all notice and publication costs
incurred pursuant to Section
602.07. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner
of the abandoned motor vehicle or any person having a security interest
therein, as their interests may appear, for ninety days, and then shall be
deposited into the Treasury of the County.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.09   VEHICLES ABANDONED IN GARAGES.
   Any motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, or part thereof, left for more
than ten days in a garage operated for commercial purposes or for more than ten
days after the period when, pursuant to contract, the vehicle was to remain on
the premises, shall be deemed an abandoned motor vehicle and may be reported by
the garagekeeper to the County, after notice by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, to the owner and all persons having security
interests therein, to pick up the vehicle within fifteen days of the notice.
All abandoned vehicles left in garages may be taken into custody by the Sheriff
in accordance with Section
602.06 and shall be subject to the notice and sale provisions contained in
Sections
602.07 and
602.08, provided that if such vehicle is reclaimed in accordance with Section
602.07, the person reclaiming such vehicle shall, in addition to the other
charges required to be paid, pay the charges of the garagekeeper, if any.
Further, if such vehicle is sold pursuant to Section
602.08, the garagekeeper's charges, if any, shall be paid from, and to the
extent of, the excess of the proceeds of sale after paying the expenses of the
auction, the costs of towing, preserving and storing such vehicle which
resulted from placing such vehicle in custody and all notice and publication
costs incurred pursuant to Section
602.07.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.10   DISPOSITION OF INOPERABLE ABANDONED VEHICLES.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any inoperable
abandoned vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, or part thereof, which has been
taken into custody, may be disposed of to a demolisher, after notice and
hearing, if requested, as provided in Section
602.07, by the person or locality on whose property or in whose possession the
motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, or part thereof, is found. The
demolisher, on taking custody of the inoperable abandoned motor vehicle, shall
notify the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles on forms and in the manner
prescribed by the Commissioner of the Department. Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, no other report or notice shall be required in this instance.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.11   SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATE OF TITLE, ETC., BY DEMOLISHER; RECORDS.
   (a)   Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires a motor vehicle for
purposes of wrecking, dismantling or demolition shall not be required to obtain
a certificate of title for such motor vehicle in his or her own name. After the
motor vehicle has been demolished, processed or changed so that it physically
is no longer a motor vehicle, the demolisher shall surrender to the State
Department of Motor Vehicles for cancellation the certificate of title or sales
receipt therefor.
   (b)   A demolisher shall keep an accurate and complete record of all motor
vehicles purchased or received by him or her in the course of his or her
business. These records shall contain the name and address of the person from
whom each such motor vehicle was purchased or received and the date when such
purchases or receipts occurred.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.12   VEHICLES ABANDONED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in the case of an
abandoned motor vehicle on private property, the owner or person in control of
the private property may send a notice, by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the owner of record of the motor vehicle and all persons
having security interests therein of record in the office of the State
Department of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle by year, make, model
and serial number, and advising that unless the vehicle is reclaimed and
removed within thirty days from the date of the notice, such owner and all
persons having security interests in the vehicle shall be deemed under this
section to have waived all right, title and interest in the vehicle. If the
motor vehicle is not reclaimed by the owner of record or any person having a
security interest therein of record within thirty days from the date of the
notice, the owner of the private property upon which the motor vehicle was
abandoned may apply to the State Department of Motor Vehicles for a title to
such vehicle.
   The provisions of this section shall apply only to motor vehicles registered
in the State.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.13   SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY FOUND IN UNATTENDED OR ABANDONED VEHICLES.
   Any personal property found in an unattended or abandoned motor vehicle,
trailer or semitrailer may be sold incident to the sale of any such vehicle as
authorized in this chapter.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.14   REMOVAL OF UNATTENDED AND IMMOBILE VEHICLES; DISPOSITION.
   (a)   Unattended motor vehicles and immobile motor vehicles may be removed
for safekeeping by or under the direction of the Sheriff or a deputy to a
storage garage or area. However, no such vehicle shall be so removed from
private property without the written request of the owner, lessee or occupant
thereof.
   (b)   The person at whose request a motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer is
removed from private property shall indemnify the County against any loss or
expense incurred by reason of the removal, storage or sale thereof.
   (c)   Each removal shall be reported immediately to the Sheriff and notice
thereof shall be given to the owner of the motor vehicle, trailer or
semitrailer as promptly as possible.
   (d)   The owner of such vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, before obtaining
possession thereof, shall pay to the parties entitled thereto all reasonable
costs incident to removing, storing and locating the owner of the motor
vehicle, trailer or semitrailer. If such owner fails or refuses to pay such
costs, or if the identity or whereabouts of such owner is unknown and
unascertainable after a diligent search has been made, and after notice has
been given to him or her at his or her last known address and to the holder of
any lien of record, in the office of the State Department of Motor Vehicles,
against the motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, the vehicle shall be treated
as an abandoned vehicle under the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 93-03. Passed 3-17-93.)
602.15   REMOVAL OF VEHICLES LEFT ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; DISPOSITION; NOTICE.
   (a)   Upon the written complaint of the owner of private property on which
any motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, or part thereof, has been left for
more than seventy-two hours without the owner's consent, any such motor
vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, or part thereof, may be removed by or under
the direction of the Sheriff to a storage area. Owners of private property
normally open to the public for parking shall post or cause to be posted signs
warning that vehicles left on the property for more than seventy-two hours will
be towed or removed at their owner's expense.
   (b)   The person at whose request the vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, or
part thereof, is removed, shall indemnify the County against any loss or
expense incurred by reason of removal, storage or sale thereof.
   (c)   In the case of the removal of a motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer,
or part thereof, from private property, when it cannot be readily sold, the
motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer, or part thereof, may be disposed of as
provided in Section
602.10. The State Department of Motor Vehicles shall be notified of the
disposition of any motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer under Section
602.10 or the provisions of this section. In all other respects, the provisions
of Section
602.14 shall apply to these removals. Disposal shall be carried out under the

of this chapter by any person shall be entitled to recover the value thereof or
the damage done thereto in an appropriate action at law from such person. The

hold such dog or cat pending action before the General District Court or any
other court. If no such action is instituted within seven days, the Animal
Control Officer or other officer shall deliver the dog or cat to its owner. The

shall raise no presumption of theft against the owner of such premises. The
Animal Control Officer may take such dog or cat in charge and/or notify its
legal owner, if known, to remove it. The legal owner of the animal shall pay

a leash. The owner or custodian must have physical control of the dog while it
is leashed. Any dog found to be off leash and not on the property of its owner
or custodian will be considered running at large, and in violation of this
section. When in a securely fenced, specifically designated dog park or dog
exercise area established by a homeowner's association, community organization,
or governmental agency, a dog may be off leash while under the immediate
supervision of its owner or custodian. Any fence enclosing such an area must be
designed to prevent escape. This section shall not apply to any person who uses
a dog under his/her direct supervision while lawfully hunting, or while engaged
in a supervised formal obedience training class, or if the dog is a service
animal whose handler, because of a disability, is unable to use a harness,
leash, or other tether, or the use of such device would interfere with the
service dog's safe and effective performance of work or tasks, provided that
the service dog is otherwise under the handler's control through voice control,
signals or other effective means or to any person with a dog under immediate
control within any unincorporated area of the County zoned at a density of
fewer than two housing units per acre.

612.14   DOGS KILLING, INJURING OR CHASING LIVESTOCK OR POULTRY.
   It shall be the duty of any Animal Control Officer, or other officer who may
find a dog in the act of killing or injuring livestock or poultry, to kill such
dog forthwith whether such dog bears a tag or not. Any person finding a dog
committing any of the depredations mentioned in this section shall have the
right to kill such dog on sight as shall any owner of livestock or his agent
finding a dog chasing livestock on land utilized by the livestock; or chasing
livestock on land lawfully utilized by the livestock when the circumstances
show that such chasing is harmful to the livestock. Any court shall have the
power to order the Animal Control Officer or other officer to kill any dog
known to be a confirmed livestock or poultry killer. Any dog killing poultry
for the third time shall be considered a confirmed poultry killer. The court,
through its contempt powers, may compel the owner, custodian or harborer of the
dog to produce the animal.
   Any Animal Control Officer, who has reason to believe that a dog is killing
livestock or poultry, shall be empowered to seize such dog solely for the
purpose of examining such animal in order to determine whether it committed any
of the depredations mentioned herein. Any Animal Control Officer or other
person who has reason to believe that any dog is killing livestock, or
committing any of the depredations mentioned in this section, shall apply to a
magistrate of the county or town wherein such dog may be, who shall issue a
warrant requiring the owner or custodian, if known, to appear before the
General District Court at a time and place named therein, at which time
evidence shall be heard. If it shall appear that the dog is a livestock killer,
or has committed any of the depredations mentioned in this section, the
District Court shall order that the dog be:
      (1)   Killed immediately by the Animal Control Officer or other officer
designated by the court, or
      (2)   Removed to another state which does not border on the Commonwealth
and prohibited from returning to the Commonwealth.
   Any dog ordered removed from the Commonwealth which is later found in the
Commonwealth shall be ordered by a court to be killed immediately.

612.15   COMPENSATION FOR LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY KILLED BY DOGS.
   Any person who has any livestock or poultry killed or injured by any dog not
his own shall be entitled to receive as compensation the fair market value of
such livestock or poultry, not to exceed four hundred dollars ($400.00) per
animal or ten dollars ($10.00) per fowl, provided that: (i) the Animal Control
Officer shall have been notified of the incident within seventy-two hours of
its discovery; (ii) the claimant has furnished evidence within sixty days of
discovery of the quantity and value of the dead or injured livestock and the
reasons the claimant believes that death or injury was caused by a dog; and
(iii) the claimant first has exhausted his legal remedies against the owner, if
known, of the dog doing the damage for which compensation under this section is
sought. Exhaustion shall mean a judgment against the owner of the animal upon
which an execution has been returned unsatisfied.
   The requirements of (i) and (iii) may be waived if the Animal Control
Officer has investigated the incident and supports the claim. Upon payment
under this section the County shall be subrogated to the right of action of the
owner of the livestock or poultry against the owner of the dog to the extent of
compensation paid, and may enforce the same in an appropriate action at law.

unwanted or impounded animals from within the County.
   (a)   The Animal Control Officer shall deliver all animals taken into
custody, any dog running at large, or any dog which has not been vaccinated or
licensed as required by this chapter, to the Animal Shelter and may issue a
summons against the owner or custodian of such animal for a violation of
Section
612.13. Any animal confined pursuant to this section shall be kept for a period
of not less than five working days, such period to commence on the day
immediately following the day the dog is initially confined in the Animal
Shelter, unless sooner claimed by the rightful owner thereof. The Department
shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain whether the animal has a collar,
tag, license, tattoo, or other form of identification. If such identification
is found on the animal, the animal shall be held for an additional five days,
unless sooner claimed by the rightful owner. If the rightful owner of the
animal can be readily identified, the operator or custodian of the shelter
shall make a reasonable effort to notify the owner of the animal’s confinement
within the next 48 hours following its confinement.

         If the documents required in subsections (b)(2) and (6) of this
section are not presented at the time of the animal's redemption the owner
shall obtain the required documents for the animal within two weeks of
redemption and provide proof of such to the Department. Failure to provide
proof that the required documents have been obtained will result in the
issuance of a summons.
   (c)   If an animal impounded pursuant to this section has not been claimed
upon expiration of the appropriate holding period, it shall be deemed abandoned
and become the property of the Loudoun County Animal Shelter. The owner or
custodian of any such animal, who has been notified by the Department of the
animal's impoundment, shall be responsible for all applicable fees, which fees
shall be due and payable within ten days of the date upon which the animal
becomes the property of the County.
   (d)   An owner or custodian shall make payment of an impoundment fee in
accordance with the fee schedule should an Animal Control Officer pick up and
impound an owned animal at the request of the owner.
   (e)   Any animal which becomes the property of the Animal Shelter pursuant
to subsection (c) of this section may be (i) adopted by a resident of the
County who will pay the required adoption fee and if adopting a dog, the dog

signed a statement specifying that he has never been convicted of animal
cruelty, neglect or abandonment, (ii) adopted by a resident of an adjacent
political subdivision of the Commonwealth who will pay the required adoption
fees, provided that such resident has read and signed a statement specifying
that he has never been convicted of animal cruelty, neglect or abandonment,
(iii) transferred to any releasing agency within the Commonwealth, provided
that each releasing agency obtains a signed statement from each of its
directors, operators, staff, or animal caregivers specifying that each
individual has never been convicted of animal cruelty, neglect, or abandonment
and updates such statements as changes occur, (iv) adopted by any person
provided that such person has read and signed a statement specifying that he or
she has never been convicted of animal cruelty, neglect or abandonment; however
no animal may be adopted by any person who is not a resident of the County or
an adjacent political subdivision unless the animal is first sterilized, which
the Animal Shelter may require be done at the expense of the person adopting
the animal, or (v) humanely euthanized. Nothing contained in this subsection
shall prohibit the destruction of a critically injured or critically ill animal
for humane purposes.
   (f)   A person adopting a dog or cat that is over four months old from the
Animal Shelter must obtain for the adopted animal a rabies certificate. A
resident of the County adopting a dog over four months old must also obtain a
County dog license. These requirements, if applicable, must be obtained within
two weeks of adoption and proof of such provided to the Department. Failure to
do so may result in the issuance of a summons.
   (g)   Owners or custodians of animals ordered quarantined by the Health
Department shall be responsible for payment of an impoundment fee and the daily
board, in accordance with the Department fee schedule.

death, such owner shall forthwith have its body cremated or buried or request
such service from an officer or other person designated for the purpose. If the
owner fails to do so, any judge of a general district court, after notice to
the owner if he can be ascertained, shall cause any such dead animal or fowl to
be cremated or buried by an officer or other person designated for the purpose.
Such officer or other person shall be entitled to recover of the owner of every
such animal or fowl that is cremated or buried the actual cost of the cremation
or burial and a reasonable fee to be recovered in the same manner as officers'
fees are recovered, free from all exemptions in favor of such owner. Any person
violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a Class 4
misdemeanor.

612.18   RABID ANIMALS.
   (a)   Dogs or cats showing active signs of rabies or suspected of having
rabies shall be confined under competent observation for such a time as may be
necessary to determine a diagnosis. If confinement is impossible or
impracticable, such dog or cat shall be euthanized as provided in Section
612.16. Every person having knowledge of the existence of an animal apparently
afflicted with rabies shall report immediately to the County Health Department
the existence of such animal, the place where the animal was seen, the owner's
name, if known, and the symptoms suggesting rabies.
   (b)   Any dog or cat, for which no proof of current rabies vaccination is
available, and which is exposed to rabies through a bite, or through saliva or
central nervous system tissue, in a fresh open wound or mucous membrane, by an
animal believed to be infected with rabies, and which is not available for
rabies testing, shall be confined in the Animal Shelter or in a kennel or
enclosure approved by the Health Department for a period not to exceed six
months at the expense of the owner. If confinement is not feasible, the dog or
cat shall be euthanized as provided in Section
612.16. A rabies vaccination shall be administered prior to release.
Inactivated rabies vaccine may be administered at the beginning of confinement.
Any dog or cat so bitten, or exposed to rabies through saliva or central
nervous system tissue, in a fresh open wound or mucous membrane, with proof of
a current rabies vaccination, shall be revaccinated immediately following the
bite and shall be confined to the premises of the owner, or other site as may
be approved by the Health Department, for a period of forty-five days. If it
later becomes known that the animal which bit the confined animal was not
rabid, the confined animal shall be released.
   (c)   At the discretion of the Director of the Health Department, any animal
which has bitten a person shall be confined under competent observation for ten
days unless the animal develops active symptoms of rabies or expires before
that. A seriously injured or sick animal may be humanely euthanized as provided
in Section
612.16 and its head sent to the Health Department for evaluation. If
confinement cannot, in the opinion of the Health Director, be made on the
premises of the owner, the animal shall be confined in a manner approved by the
Health Director, and the owner shall be responsible for an impoundment fee, if
applicable, and the daily board in accordance with the fee schedule. Upon
written direction from the Health Director the Animal Control Officer shall
confine the animal at the Animal Shelter for the required period at the expense
of the owner.
   (d)   When a human is exposed to rabies by a wild nondomestic, feral
domestic or nonindigenous animal for which the period of rabies virus shedding,
prior to the onset of clinical signs of rabies, is unknown, according to the
State Department of Health, by a bite, lick, scratch or other exposure, the
animal shall be immediately and humanely destroyed for rabies testing. In the
case of a non-indigenous animal, where the owner submits to the Health Director
a written, sworn affidavit, and, where appropriate, other reliable evidence is
submitted, which shows to the satisfaction of the Health Director that the
animal has never been exposed to an environment where it could possibly
contract or be exposed to rabies, then the animal shall not be destroyed.
   (e)   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Subsection (e) was repealed by Ordinance 83-06, passed

possession of or being regularly fed or sheltered by a resident of the County.
(Ord. 85-17. Passed 12-16-85.)
   (g)   When any potentially rabid animal, other than a dog or cat, exposes or
may have exposed a person to rabies through a bite, or through saliva or
central nervous system tissue, in a fresh open wound or mucous membrane, that
animal shall be confined at the discretion of the Health Director in a manner
approved by the Health Department or humanely euthanized as provided in Section
612.16 and its head sent to the Health Department for evaluation.
   (h)   When any animal, other than a dog or cat, is exposed to rabies through
a bite, or through saliva or central nervous system tissue, in a fresh open
wound or mucous membrane, by an animal believed to be afflicted with rabies,
that newly exposed animal shall be confined at the discretion of the Health
Director in a manner approved by the Health Department or humanely euthanized
as provided in Section
612.16.

612.22   HUNTING AND TRAPPING NEAR HIGHWAYS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the traveling

612.23   SEIZURE AND DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED, NEGLECTED, CRUELLY TREATED ANIMALS.
   (a)   In General. Any animal found abandoned, neglected, cruelly treated, or
in such a condition as to constitute a direct and immediate threat to its life,
safety or health may be seized pursuant to Section 3.2-6569 of the Code of
Virginia of 1950, as amended, and humanely disposed of by sale, adoption or
euthanasia at the discretion of the Director after ten days following the date
on which the animal was seized or in accordance with a judicial determination
by the General District Court that the owner is unable to adequately provide
for the animal or is not a fit person to own the animal, provided, however,
that the hearing required by Section 3.2-6569 of the Code of Virginia of 1950,
as amended, to be set within ten days of the date of seizure, may be continued
to a later date if the owner of the animal provides a cash or corporate surety
bond in accordance with subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   Postponement of Disposal by Posting Security. A person claiming an
interest in any animal confined under subsection (a) hereof pursuant to Section
3.2-6569 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, may prevent disposition
of the animal after the ten-day period set forth in subsection (a) hereof by
posting a cash or corporate surety bond with the Treasurer prior to expiration
of the ten-day period in an amount sufficient to secure payment for all
reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for the animal, including
estimated medical care, for at least thirty days, not to exceed nine months,
inclusive of the date on which the animal was seized. However, such bond or
security shall not prevent the authority having custody of the animal from
disposing of such animal at the end of the period covered by the bond or
security. The amount of the bond shall be determined by the Director, based on
the current rate for board and on the condition of the animal after examination
of the animal by a licensed veterinarian. At the conclusion of the case, the
bond shall be forfeited to the County if the court determines that the animal
has been abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. If the court
determines that the animal has been (i) abandoned or cruelly treated, (ii)
deprived of adequate care, as that term is defined in § 3.2-6500, or (iii)
raised as a dog that has been, is, or is intended to be used in dogfighting in
violation of § 3.2-6571, then the court shall order that the animal may be: (a)
sold by the County, if not a companion animal; (b) disposal of by the County
pursuant to subsection D of § 3.2-6546, whether such animal is a companion
animal or an agricultural animal; or (c) delivered to the person with a right
of property in the animal as provided in subsection (c). The bond shall not be
forfeited if the owner is found to be not guilty of the violation.
   In no case shall the owner be allowed to purchase, adopt, or otherwise
obtain the animal if the court determines that the animal has been abandoned,
cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. The court shall direct that the
animal be delivered to the person with a right of property in the animal, upon
his request, if the court finds that the abandonment, cruel treatment, or
deprivation of adequate care is not attributable to the actions or inactions of
such person.
   (c)   Notice. The authority taking custody of the animal under the foregoing
provisions shall, within twenty-four hours, give notice of this section by
posting a copy of it at the location where the animal was seized or by
delivering it to a person residing on the property of the owner.

such condition exists, stating therein the condition which constitutes a
nuisance and directing such addressee to remedy the condition within the time
stated in such notice, which time shall be not more than ten days. No such

receipt by the owner or occupant of the notice to abate, correct or eliminate

violation of this chapter exists and was caused or permitted to be caused by
the appellant. No person shall fail, refuse or neglect to comply with any such
order.
(Ord. 85-08. Passed 5-20-85.)
648.08   NONCOMPLIANCE WITH NOTICES; RECOURSE OF COUNTY.
   (a)   Upon the failure of any person to whom notice has been given, pursuant
to Section
648.07, to comply with the terms of such notice, or with the terms imposed by
the Board of Supervisors on appeal, as the case may be, the County
Administrator or the Director of Public Health shall forthwith direct the
appropriate County officer to remedy the condition which is the subject of such
notice, and the expense incurred by the County in so doing shall be charged to
the addressee of such notice, to be collected in the same manner as County
taxes or in any other manner authorized by law. Every charge authorized by this
section with which the owner of any such property has been assessed and which
remains unpaid shall constitute a lien against such property, and such lien
shall be recorded in the judgment lien docket book in the Clerk's office of the
Circuit Court.
   (b)   Abatement by the County of any condition which constitutes a nuisance
and reimbursement to the County of expenses incurred thereby shall not bar
prosecution for maintenance of a nuisance.
(Ord. 85-08. Passed 5-20-85.)
648.09   UNKNOWN OR UNLOCATED OWNERS.
   If the County Administrator, after a reasonable search, is unable to
identify or ascertain the whereabouts of the lawful owner of property on which
an obstruction exists, and after the notice and order required by Section
648.07 have been sent to the last known post office address of such owner, if
known, the County may undertake to repair or remove such obstruction after
giving notice by publication once each week for two weeks in a newspaper of
general circulation in the area where such property is located.
(Ord. 85-08. Passed 5-20-85.)
648.10   SUMMARY ABATEMENT.
   In addition to the other remedies prescribed by this chapter, if it is
determined that a hazardous condition, nuisance or obstruction is likely to
have an immediate adverse effect upon public health or safety, then the County
Administrator may order such condition to be summarily abated, by the County,
in a reasonably prudent manner.
(Ord. 85-08. Passed 5-20-85.)
648.11   AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS.
   No agricultural operation or any of its appurtenances shall be considered a
nuisance unless such nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation
of any such agricultural operation or its appurtenances.
(Ord. 85-08. Passed 5-20-85.)
648.12   INTERPRETATION.
   The remedies, procedures and causes of action provided for in this chapter

the full amount of such cost incurred. All such reimbursements shall be
promptly deposited in a Johnsongrass control account in the General Revenue
Fund, and shall revert to the County Fund at the end of each fiscal year,

unobligated balance on that date shall be available for reappropriation in the
following fiscal years, for any purpose deemed appropriate by the Board of

for qualification of land as agricultural land under the Special Land Use
Assessment Act, the Commissioner of Revenue shall consider such reported
violation of Sections
690.01 to

agricultural or horticultural assessment under Section 58.1-3229 et seq. of the
Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended.

employees, has reasonable grounds to believe that Johnsongrass exists on any
property within the County, and the owner or lessee of that land refuses to
permit the Committee or its agents, employees or members to enter on such
property to inspect, spray or otherwise control or eradicate the Johnsongrass,
the Committee or any member thereof, after requesting permission to enter such
property and after such request has been refused, may request the
Commonwealth's Attorney or any law enforcement officer of the County to procure
a search warrant enabling the Committee to enter onto the property and to
inspect, observe and search for Johnsongrass on such property.

computing gross revenue from sources other than a grantee's subscribers,
including, without limitation, revenue derived from the sale of advertising,
home shopping services, guide sales, the lease of channel capacity on its cable

system, the amount of such revenues attributable or allocated to the grantee in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, for the purpose of
determining gross revenues, shall be the aggregate revenue received by the
grantee from such other sources during the period in question multiplied by a

hereafter holds any property interest, which, consistent with the purposes for
which it was dedicated, may be used for the purpose of installing and
maintaining a cable system. No reference herein, or in any franchise agreement,
to a public right-of- way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee
by the County that its interest or other right to control the use of such
property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a grantee shall
be deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the County and as
the County may have the undisputed right and power to give.
      (22)   “Service interruption” means the loss of picture or sound on one

shall be added the number of all other subscribers.
   (b)   The definitions contained in this chapter rely on those contained in
the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 521 et seq.), as it is from time to
time amended and interpreted. Any ambiguity shall be resolved by reference to
the Federal statutes and regulations and the decisions interpreting the same.
(Ord. 98-05. Passed 4-15-98.)
805.03   GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Scope of County's Authority. The County may grant one or more
franchises, and each such franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and
subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Franchise Required. A franchise is required of any person desiring to
construct, operate and maintain a cable system within all or any portion of the
County. A franchise may be granted by the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors
to any person, whether operating under an existing franchise or not, who or
which offers to furnish and provide such cable system under and pursuant to the
terms and provisions of this chapter and a franchise agreement acceptable to
the Board of Supervisors. The grant of a cable franchise is not an
authorization to provide other services, nor is it a bar to the imposition of
other compensation requirements with regard to the provision of such other
services.
   (c)   Rights Reserved to County. The County hereby expressly reserves the
following rights:
      (1)   To exercise its governmental powers, now or hereafter, to the full
extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the County.
      (2)   To adopt and promulgate ordinances as it shall find reasonably
necessary in the exercise of its lawful police powers. Such power shall include
all rights the County may have under 47 U.S.C. 552, the Communications Act of
1934, as amended, and the absolute right of the County to manage the public
rights-of-way and to adopt such regulations relating to the management of the
public rights-of-way as the County and/or its departments shall provide.
Nothing in a franchise agreement shall be deemed to waive the requirements of
the various codes and ordinances of the County regarding permits, fees to be
paid, or manner of construction.
      (3)   To award additional non-exclusive cable television franchises to
serve the County in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and
applicable law.
      (4)   To issue a license, easement or other permit to a person other than
a grantee, to permit such person to traverse any portion of a grantee's
franchise area in the County in order to provide service outside the County.
Such license, easement or other permit, absent a grant or a franchise in
accordance with this chapter, does not authorize or permit such a person to
provide a cable television service of any nature to a home or place of business
in the County or to render any service or connect a subscriber in the County to
the grantee's cable television system.
      (5)   To amend this chapter as well as enact separate ordinances and
regulations that become necessary under the County's police powers to protect
the health, safety and welfare of its citizens.
   (d)   Unlawful Acts; Penalties.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person to establish, operate or carry
on the business of distributing to any persons in the County any television
signals or radio signals by means of a cable system, unless a franchise
therefor has first been obtained pursuant to the provisions of this chapter,
and unless such franchise is in full force and effect.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for any person to make any unauthorized
connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or
otherwise, with any part of a franchised cable system within the County for the
purpose of enabling himself or herself or others to receive any television
signal, radio signal, picture, program or sound, without payment to the owner
of the cable system.
      (3)   It shall be unlawful for any person, without the consent of a
grantee, to willfully tamper with, remove or injure any cables, wires or
equipment used for distribution of television signals, radio signals, pictures,
programs or sound.
      (4)   Any person violating any subsection of this section shall be
punished by a fine or by imprisonment or by both fine and imprisonment in
accordance with Federal, State or local law.
   (e)   Failure of County to Enforce Compliance. A grantee shall not be
excused from complying with any of the provisions of this chapter or the terms
and conditions of a franchise agreement by any failure of the County, upon any
one or more occasions, to insist upon the grantee's performance or to seek the
grantee's compliance with any of the provisions of this chapter or terms or
conditions of a franchise agreement.

      (13)   Any other reasonable and applicable information which the Loudoun
County Board of Supervisors or its designee may request.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the County shall provide an opportunity to an
applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise by
virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps
taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their
recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the
remoteness of the matter from the operation of its cable systems.
   (c)   Evaluating Application.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application, and before authorizing the issuance
of a franchise agreement, either pursuant to an application filed under
subsection (a) hereof or in response to a request for proposal under subsection
(d) hereof, the County shall evaluate the application and conduct such
investigations as it deems necessary, including the review of the applicant's
legal, financial and technical qualifications and the adequacy and feasibility
of the applicant's qualifications to operate a cable television system within
the County based upon information provided to the County by the applicant and
by other sources in writing or at any public hearing or meeting of the Board of
Supervisors.
      (2)   In evaluating an application for a franchise, the County shall
consider, among other things, the following factors:
         A.   Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal
qualifications to provide cable service;
         B.   Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements
established by the County and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-
related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of
meeting such needs and interests;
         C.   Whether above, the applicant will provide adequate public,
educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial
support;
         D.   Whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest,
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and
private property that would be affected by the cable system, including the
extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require
replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or
use of the public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a franchise on the
ability of an existing franchisee, if any, to meet the cable related needs and
interests of the community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of
competing applications; and
         E.   What effects a grant of a franchise may have on competition in
the delivery of cable service in the County.
            If the County finds that it is in the public interest to issue a
franchise after considering the information submitted by the applicant and the
factors set forth above, and subject to the applicant's entry into a franchise
agreement, it shall issue a franchise. If the County denies an application for
an initial franchise, it will issue a written decision setting forth its
reasons for denial. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the
County will hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures
under which comments from the public on an application may be received. The
County may reject any application that is incomplete.
      (3)   The County or its designee may seek additional information from any
applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information.
   (d)   Request for Proposals.
      (1)   The County may, at any time, issue a request for proposal for the
provision of cable television services in the County.
      (2)   The County may, at any time, conduct a proceeding to identify the
future cable related needs and interests of the community.
      (3)   Respondents to a request for proposal shall respond to such request
by following the procedures, instructions and requirements set forth in the
request for proposal. All responses to requests for proposals shall be
evaluated in the same manner as provided for an application filed under
subsection (a) hereof.
      (4)   Any respondent to a request for proposal who has an application for
a franchise pending at the time of the County's issuance of a request for
proposal need not refile the same materials with its response to the request
for proposal, but must supplement its application to include any additional or
different information or material required by the request for proposal.
      (5)   The County may reject any response that fails to respond fully to a
request for proposal.
   (e)   Public Hearing. Before authorizing the issuance of any franchise
agreement, either pursuant to an application or pursuant to a response to a
request for a proposal, the County Board of Supervisors shall conduct at least
one public hearing thereon, with notice as required by Section 15.2-1427 of the
Code of Virginia.
   (f)   Awarding a Franchise. After examining all applications submitted
pursuant to procedures to be established by the County Board of Supervisors
designed to assure the legal, financial and technical qualifications of an
applicant to provide cable service, the Board of Supervisors is authorized,
after a full public hearing on all relevant factors, including economic
considerations, the impact on private property rights, the impact on public
convenience, the public need and potential benefit, and provided the Board
finds that the public welfare will be enhanced by the award of a franchise, to
grant a nonexclusive franchise conveying the right to construct and operate a
cable system within the public ways of the County. A franchise may be awarded
to the applicant which, in the Board of Supervisors' judgment, will best serve
the public interest and whose construction and financial plans and arrangements
are both feasible and adequate to fulfill the conditions set forth in this
chapter and incorporated into any franchise granted.
   No provision in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to require the
Board of Supervisors to grant a franchise following receipt of any franchise
application.
   (g)   Franchise Term. The term of a franchise shall be for the number of
years negotiated in the franchise agreement with the County unless terminated
earlier in accordance with this chapter.
   (h)   Franchise Fees.
      (1)   The grantee shall pay the County five percent of its gross revenue
as a franchise fee.
      (2)   The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly to the County. A
grantee shall file a complete, accurate, and verified statement listing each
and every type of revenue included in the gross revenue collected as a result
of its doing business within the County during the period for which said
quarterly payment is made. Such payment shall be made to the County Treasurer
not later than thirty days after the end of each calendar quarter.
      (3)   The County may examine all applicable records of a grantee to
determine the accuracy of amounts payable to County.
      (4)   The County shall have right to audit and to re-compute any amounts
determined to be payable under this chapter, provided, however, that such audit
shall take place within thirty-six months following the close of each of a
grantee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the County as a result of
the audit shall be paid within thirty days following written notice to the
grantee by the County. Said notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
      (5)   In the event that any franchise fee payment or re-computed amount
is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, and
following notice by the County to a grantee, interest shall be charged daily
from such date at the annual rate equivalent to the then existing prime rate of
the largest bank in the County plus two percent.
   (i)   Grantee to be Bound by Terms and Conditions of Cable Chapter and
Franchise Agreement; Procedure if Conflict Exists.
      (1)   No franchise shall be valid until the grantee enters into a
franchise agreement having terms and conditions acceptable to the County.
      (2)   In the event of a conflict between the franchise agreement and the
provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
Failure to provide services as promised in the grantee's franchise may be
deemed a material breach of this chapter to which the provisions of Section
805.15 and Section
805.16 of this chapter shall apply.
(Ord. 98-05. Passed 4-15-98.)
805.05   TRANSFERS AND ASSIGNMENTS.
   (a)   Grantee Shall Offer County Opportunity to Purchase System. In the
event that a Grantee makes a determination to sell or transfer its system, in
whole or in part, the grantee shall offer the County an opportunity to purchase
the system at fair market value.
   (b)   Prior Written Consent of County Required Before Any Sale, Assignment
or Transfer of a Franchise and/or Change of Control or Ownership of the
Grantee.
      (1)   A franchise granted under this chapter is a privilege to be held in
personal trust by the grantee. Sale or transfer of a franchise is prohibited
without the consent of the Board of Supervisors, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. A franchise shall not be assigned, transferred, sold or
disposed of, in whole or in part, by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or
otherwise, or by forced or involuntary sale, without the prior consent of the
Board of Supervisors expressed by resolution, and then only on such conditions
as may therein be prescribed. The County is hereby authorized to take legal or
equitable action to set aside, annul, revoke or cancel the franchise, or the
transfer of the franchise, if such transfer is not made according to the
procedures set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   Prior approval of the Board is required where (i) ownership of ten
percent of the voting interest of a publicly-held grantee or twenty-five
percent of the voting interest of a privately-held grantee is acquired in any
transaction or series of transactions, by a person or group of persons acting
in concert, none of whom already owns five percent or more of the grantee,
singularly or collectively, or (ii) control of more than ten percent of the
right of control of a publicly- held grantee or twenty-five percent of the
right of control of a privately-held grantee is acquired in any transaction or
series of transactions, by a person or a group of persons acting in concert,
none of whom already controls five percent or more of such right of control,
singularly or collectively, or (iii) there is any other change which
accomplishes a change in actual working or defacto ownership or control of the
grantee by minor interest holders in whatever manner exercised. By its
acceptance of a franchise, a grantee specifically grants and agrees that any
such acquisition or change of control occurring without prior approval of the
Board shall constitute a violation of the franchise by the grantee.
   (c)   No Consent Required for Securing an Indebtedness if the Indebtedness
Does Not Exceed Seventy-Five Percent of the Fair Market Value of the Cable
System. No such consent as set forth in subsection (b) hereof shall be required
for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation, in
whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, except when such hypothecation
exceeds seventy-five percent of the fair market value of the property used by
the grantee in the operation of its cable television system. Prior consent of
the Board, expressed by resolution, shall be required for such transfer where
hypothecation exceeds seventy-five percent of fair market value, and such
consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.
   (d)   Grantee to Submit Application Documenting Information Required by the
County.
      (1)   A grantee shall promptly notify the County of any action or
proposed action requiring consent of the County pursuant to subsections (b)
through (m) hereof.
      (2)   A grantee shall submit to the County an original application and
four copies, unless otherwise directed, which application shall fully describe
the terms and conditions of the action or proposed action subject to this
section and clearly state the basis on which the application should be
approved. The application shall also contain all documentation to support the
showings required under subsections (e) and (f) hereof.
      (3)   At any time during the review process, the County reserves the
right to require additional supporting documentation from a grantee or any
other person involved in the action or proposed action to support the showing
required of the grantee under subsections (e) and (f) hereof. A grantee shall
provide all requested assistance to the County in connection with any such
inquiry and, as appropriate, shall secure the cooperation and assistance of all
other persons involved in such action.
      (4)   The County shall respond to any application requiring the County's
consent under subsections (b) through (n) hereof within 120 days after such
application, and all information required by the County under this chapter, the
grantee's franchise agreement and applicable law, in connection with the
application, has been received by the County. Such an application shall be
deemed approved if the County should fail to render a final decision within 120
days following the grantee's filing of the application and the County's receipt
of all information reasonably required to accompany such an application under
this chapter, the grantee's franchise agreement and applicable law, unless the
grantee and the County agree to an extension of time, provided, however, that
the County may deny such an application, among other grounds, for a grantee's
failure to submit the information required by this chapter, the grantee's
franchise agreement and applicable law.
   (e)   Showings Required of Proposed Assignee; Assignee Must Agree to
Conditions Prescribed by County. A proposed assignee or transferee must
demonstrate that it possesses the legal, financial and technical qualifications
necessary to perform all the terms, conditions and obligations under the
grantee's franchise agreement for the remaining term thereof, and such
reasonable additional obligations required of the assignee or transferee by the
County for the specific and limited purpose of assuring the performance by the
assignee or transferee of all the terms, conditions and obligations of the
franchise agreement, and, in connection with this purpose, a proposed assignee

      (1)   Legal qualifications. The application shall identify the proposed
assignee or transferee and, if the proposed assignee or transferee is not a
natural person, each of its officers, directors or shareholders owning or
beneficially holding five percent or more of its outstanding voting shares,
general partners and limited partners holding an equity interest in the
proposed assignee or transferee of five percent or more, and the respective
percentage share of each such identified officer, director, shareholder or
general or limited partner. The proposed assignee or transferee shall disclose
any pending administrative, legal, equitable or dispute resolution proceeding
before, or adverse final action taken during the past three years by any court,
administrative body or arbitrator with respect to the proposed assignee,
transferee or its officers, directors, or other persons having an equitable
interest in five percent or more of the voting stock of such transferee or
assignee in a civil, criminal, administrative or equitable proceeding brought
under the provisions of any law or regulation related to the following: any
felony; revocation, suspension or involuntary transfer of any authorization
(including cable franchises) to provide video programming or other
communication services; antitrust or unfair competition; fraudulent statements

assignee or transferee prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, including balance sheets, income and expense statements,
capital expenditure statements and accompanying notes for the past three years.
Such statements, if not otherwise publicly available, may be designated as
confidential and shall be maintained as such by the County to the extent
permissible under State and local law.
      (3)   Technical qualifications. The application shall set forth a
narrative account of the proposed assignee's or transferee's technical

account shall include, but not be limited to, a list of the cable systems
currently and formerly owned or operated by the assignee or transferee within
the past three years; summary information concerning appropriate management
personnel that will be involved in the management and operation of the
assignee's or transferee's cable system; a list of any material violations of
the technical rules of the FCC or of Federal, State or local governments,
including, but not limited to, violations of rules and regulations regarding
signal quality, safety and construction cited during the past three years by a
franchising authority or by local, State or Federal governments involving
currently or formally owned or operated cable systems.
      (4)   Customer service. The assignee or transferee must submit to the
County: (i) a reasonably detailed narrative describing, or a representative

      (5)   Compliance with franchise agreement and cable chapter. The proposed
assignee or transferee must agree to comply with all provisions of the
grantee's franchise agreement and this chapter, as well as such reasonable
additional terms and conditions as the County may require for the specific and
limited purpose of assuring the proposed assignee's or transferee's compliance
with such provisions, including, without limitation, such additional terms and
conditions as the County may require to remedy or avoid the recurrence of any
past violations of the terms of a franchise or of Federal, State or local laws
in the operation of the grantee's, assignee's or transferee's cable system or
service.
   (f)   Grantee and Assignee or Transferee to Assist County in its Inquiry of
Prospective Controlling Party; Grantee Promptly to Notify County of any Actual
or Prospective Change in Control of Franchise.
      (1)   Grantee's responsibility. A grantee shall assist the County in its
inquiry into an assignee's or transferee's capabilities under subsection (e)
hereof.
      (2)   Assignee's or transferee's responsibility. In seeking the County's
consent to any change in ownership or control of a franchise or of a grantee,
the assignee or transferee shall have the responsibility to establish, to the
satisfaction of the County, that the assignee or transferee has all of the
legal, financial and technical qualifications necessary to perform all of the
terms, conditions and obligations of the grantee under its franchise agreement
for the remaining term thereof. The County may request, and the assignee or
transferee shall provide, all reasonable financial data relative to the
transfer, including, but not limited to, the materials specified in subsection
(e) hereof. In addition, the assignee or transferee shall provide to the County
the terms and conditions of the sale, credit agreements, partnership agreements
and any other information reasonably related to the assignee's or transferee's
acquisition of the grantee's franchise which is needed to clarify the change in
ownership.
   (g)   Transfer of Control Occurs With Change of Ten Percent of Voting
Interest or of Person Exercising Management Authority Over Grantee.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, “control” means the ability to exert
working control, in whatever manner exercised, over the affairs of a grantee,
either directly or indirectly.
      (2)   A rebuttable presumption that transfer of control has occurred,
including control in fact (i.e. transfer of de facto control), shall arise upon
the acquisition or accumulation by any person, or group of persons, of ten
percent of the voting interest of a publicly-held grantee, or of twenty-five
percent of the voting interest of a privately-held grantee or of the person
exercising management authority over such a privately-held grantee.
   (h)   Transfer or Assignment Without Prior Consent Deemed to be Material
Breach, and May be Subject to Liquidated Damages. Any transfer or assignment of
a franchise or of ownership or control of a grantee without the prior consent
of the County shall be null and void unless later ratified by the County and
shall: (i) be deemed a material breach of a franchise agreement and (ii) among
and/or in addition to other remedies available to the County, be subject to a
liquidated damages assessment, on a daily basis, until the transfer or
assignment is approved, or if not approved, until the prior ownership, control
or other status quo is restored to a condition satisfactory to the County.
   (i)   County May Revoke Franchise if Unauthorized Transfer or Assignment
Occurs. If the County fails to approve or denies its consent to any such
transfer or assignment of a franchise or of the ownership or control of a
grantee and such action has nevertheless been effected, the County may revoke a
franchise and terminate a franchise agreement unless control of the grantee or
the system is promptly restored to its status prior to such unauthorized action
or to a status acceptable to the County.
   (j)   Consent of County to Transfer or Assignment Shall Not Constitute
Waiver of County Rights. The consent or approval of the County Board of
Supervisors to any transfer or assignment of a franchise or of ownership or
control of a franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the
rights of the County unless the County specifically releases or waives such
rights.
   (k)   No Transfer or Assignment to be Approved Within Three Years or Prior
to Completion of Grant, Construction or Acquisition. In the absence of
compelling circumstances, the County Board of Supervisors will not approve any
transfer of control of a grantee or assignment of a franchise or cable system
within three years of its grant or initial construction or acquisition,
respectively. The following transactions, assignments or transfers are exempt
from this section: (i) a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue
Code; (ii) an assignment or transfer of control of a cable system which is
required by law or by any act, order or decree of any Federal agency or court
or any State agency or court; (iii) an assignment or transfer of control to one
or more purchasers, assignees or transferees controlled by, or under control
with, the seller, assignor or transferor; or (iv) an assignment of a franchise
or transfer of control of a grantee, which assignment or transfer has otherwise
been approved by the County, in which the franchise was renewed less than three
years prior to the proposed date of such assignment or transfer, provided that
the grantee has continuously operated such a cable system under the franchise
and any prior franchises for a period of at least three years prior to such an
assignment or transfer.
   (l)   Successor-in-Interest Must Become Signatory to an Agreement. In no
event shall an assignment of a franchise or a transfer of ownership or control
be approved without the successor-in- interest becoming a signatory to the
existing franchise agreement.
   (m)   Grantee Not to Enter Into Any Management Contract if it Results in a
Change of Control. A grantee shall not enter into any management contract or
other arrangement for the management of the system, to the extent that such
contract or other arrangement would result in a significant change of
operational control of a grantee or the system without the prior consent of the
County.
   (n)   Processing Fee May be Imposed by County. The County may impose a
processing fee upon the grantee and/or the assignee or transferee to cover its
reasonable costs of considering and evaluating an application for assignment or
transfer of a franchise. (Ord. 98-05. Passed 4-15-98.)
805.06   LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)   Indemnification of the County.
      (1)   The grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold
harmless the County and its officials, boards, commissions, agents and
employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and
judgments for damage arising out of the operation of the cable television
system under a franchise. These damages include, but are not limited to,
penalties arising out of copyright infringements and antitrust violations and
damages arising out of the failure by the grantee to secure consents from the
owners, authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by the
grantee's cable television system, whether or not any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the franchise and/or
arising out of the grantee improperly crossing private property. Indemnified
expenses include, but are not limited to, all out-of-pocket expenses, such as
attorney fees, and the reasonable value of any services rendered by the County
Attorney or his or her assistants or any employee of the County.
      (2)   The indemnity set forth in this section is conditioned upon the
County's giving the grantee prompt notice of the commencement or making of any
suit or action covered by this section. Nothing in this section shall be deemed
to prevent the County from cooperating with the grantee and participating in
the defense of any litigation by its own counsel at its sole cost and expense.
No recovery by the County of any sum, by reason of the bond required in
subsection (g) hereof, shall be a limitation upon the liability of the grantee
to the County under this chapter, except that sums so received by the County
shall be deducted from any recovery which the County establishes against the
grantee under this chapter.
   (b)   Reimbursement of Costs. A grantee shall pay all expenses incurred by
the County defending itself with regard to all damages and penalties mentioned
in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Public Liability Insurance. A grantee shall maintain throughout the
term of the franchise or any renewal or extension thereof, a general
comprehensive liability insurance policy with a company authorized to do
business in the Commonwealth of Virginia, naming as the additional insured the
County, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees, in a form
satisfactory to the County Attorney, protecting the County and all persons from
any and all claims by any person whatsoever against liability for loss or
damage for personal injury, or death occasioned by the operations of the
grantee under any franchise granted by this chapter, with a minimum liability
of (i) one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury or death of any one
person, and two million dollars ($2,000,000) for personal injury or death of
any two or more persons in any one occurrence, (ii) property damage insurance
indemnifying, defending and saving harmless the County and its boards,
commissions, agents and employees from and against all claims by any person
whatsoever for property damage occasioned by the operations of the grantee
under the franchise granted under this chapter, or alleged to have been so
caused or occurred, with a minimum liability of one million dollars
($1,000,000) for property damage to the property of any one person and two
million dollars ($2,000,000) for the property damage to the property of two or
more persons in any one occurrence and, (iii) copyright infringement insurance
indemnifying, defending and saving harmless the County and its officers,
boards, commissions, agents and employees from and against all claims of any
person whatsoever for copyright infringement occasioned by the operations of
the grantee under the franchise granted under this chapter, or alleged to have
been so caused or occurred, with a minimum of one million dollars ($1,000,000)
for the infringement of such copyright.
   (d)   Notice of Cancellation or Reduction of Coverage. The insurance
policies mentioned above shall state that the policies are extended to cover
the liability assumed by the grantee under the terms of any franchise agreement
and shall contain the following endorsement:
   “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the amount of coverage thereof reduced until thirty days after receipt by the
County by registered mail of written notice of such intent to cancel or reduce
the coverage.”
   (e)   Evidence of Insurance Filed With the County. All policies of insurance
or certified copies thereof and written evidence of payment of required
premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the County during the term of this
franchise or any renewal thereof.
   (f)   No Waiver of Insurance, Performance Bond or Letter of Credit. Recovery
by the County of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond (Section
805.06(g)) or letter of credit (Section
805.14) or otherwise does not limit a grantee's duty to indemnify the County in
any way, nor shall such recovery relieve a grantee of its obligations under a
franchise, limit the amounts owed to the County, or in any respect prevent the
County from exercising any other right or remedy it may have.
   (g)   Performance Bond.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided in a franchise agreement, prior to any
cable system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-way,
a grantee shall establish in the County's favor a performance bond in a form
satisfactory to the County Attorney, and in an amount specified in a franchise
agreement, or other authorization, as necessary to ensure the grantee's
faithful performance of the construction, upgrade or other work.
      (2)   In the event a grantee subject to such a performance bond fails to
complete the cable system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public
rights-of-way in a safe, timely, and competent manner in accordance with the
provisions of a franchise agreement, there shall be recoverable, jointly and
severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss
suffered by the County as a result, including the full amount of any
compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any
property of the grantee, or the cost of completing or repairing the cable
system construction, upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-way, plus a
reasonable allowance for attorney's fees, up to the full amount of the bond.
The County may also recover against the bond any amount recoverable against the
letter of credit where such amount exceeds that available under the letter of
credit.
      (3)   Upon completion of the cable system construction, upgrade, or other
work in the public rights-of-way and payment of all construction obligations of
the cable system to the satisfaction of the County, the County may eliminate
the bond or reduce its amount after a time appropriate to determine whether the
work performed was satisfactory, which time shall be established considering
the nature of the work performed. The County may subsequently require a new
bond or an increase in the bond amount for any subsequent construction,
upgrade, or other work in the public rights-of-way.
      (4)   The performance bond shall be issued by a surety with an A-1 or
better rating of insurance in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty
Edition, and shall be subject to the approval of the County.
      (5)   The performance bond shall contain the following endorsement: “It
is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the
surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until sixty days
after receipt by the County, by registered mail, of written notice of such
intent to cancel or not to renew.”
(Ord. 98-05. Passed 4-15-98.)
805.07   CABLE SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Map and Plan to be Provided. Unless otherwise specifically identified
in a franchise agreement, the grantee shall submit a construction or
reconstruction plan not less than ninety days prior to the date the grantee
intends to commence construction or reconstruction of the cable system, and
that plan shall be incorporated by reference and made a part of the grantee's
franchise agreement. The plan shall include cable system design details,
equipment specifications, and design performance criteria. The plan shall also
include a map of the entire franchise area and shall clearly delineate the
following:
      (1)   Areas within the franchise area where the cable system will be
available to subscribers, including a time schedule of construction or
reconstruction for each year that construction or reconstruction is proposed,
subject to normal operating conditions; and
      (2)   Areas within the franchise area where the cable system cannot
reasonably be extended due to lack of present or planned development or other
similar reasons, with the areas and the reasons for not serving them clearly
identified on the map.
   (b)   Delay in System Construction or Reconstruction Requires Consent by
County Board of Supervisors. Any delay in the cable system construction or
reconstruction beyond the times specified in the plan shall require application
to and consent of the County Board of Supervisors after receiving
recommendation from the Director of the Department of Building and Development
or his or her designee. Any delay beyond the construction or reconstruction
timetable set forth in the plan, unless approved by the County Board of
Supervisors, will be considered a violation of the franchise for which the
provisions of Sections
805.06(g) and
805.15 shall apply. However, nothing in this section shall prevent a grantee
from constructing or reconstructing the cable system earlier than planned.
   (c)   System Construction and Operation to be Consistent with County
Requirements; County to Observe Annual Proof of Performance Tests; County May
Conduct Independent Tests at Cost of Grantee. The grantee shall construct,
install, operate and maintain its system in a manner such that it operates at
all times consistent with all laws, ordinances, and construction standards of
the County; Standards of Good Engineering Practices for Measurements on Cable
Television Systems: National Cable Television Association Publication 008-0477,
as amended; and the rules and regulations and technical standards of the
Federal Communications Commission. In addition, a grantee shall provide the
County with the opportunity to observe the conduct of, and receive a written
report of the results of, the grantee's proof of performance tests. The County
may at any time, following receipt of a subscriber complaint, conduct
independent measurements of the system. The grantee shall be notified in
advance and shall pay the reasonable costs incurred by the County for any
technical assistance deemed reasonably necessary by the County for obtaining
independent verification of technical compliance with all standards.
   (d)   Additional Specifications - National, State and Local Codes.
      (1)   The grantee shall construct, install and maintain the cable system
in an orderly and professional manner, using due diligence and materials of

cooperate in the planning, locating and construction of its cable system in
utility joint trenches or common duct banks with other utilities and
telecommunications providers. The County will provide advance notice to any
grantee when it plans to open a trench and each grantee shall provide notice to
the County when it plans to open a trench. The grantee and the County will
offer to make space available to the other, and to other persons who
participate in joint trenching, on reasonable terms and conditions.
   (f)   If County Determines Any Part of Facilities Are Harmful to Health and
Safety of Any Person, Grantee Shall Promptly Correct. If, at any time, it is
determined by the County or any other agency or authority of competent
jurisdiction, that any part of the system facilities is endangering the public,
including, without limitation, missing vault or pedestal covers, temporary drop
cables that cross walkways, driveways or other areas, and low cables, riser
problems and other violations of State or local laws that are harmful to the
health or safety of any person, then a grantee shall correct all such
conditions, at its own costs and expense, within twenty-four hours of receipt
of notice from the County or any other agency or authority of competent
jurisdiction. Until such conditions are corrected, the grantee shall post
suitable warnings to ensure that the health and safety of persons possibly
affected is ensured.
   (g)   Grantee to Maintain System in Conformance With FCC Radiation Rules. A
grantee shall construct, operate and maintain the system in conformance with
FCC signal leakage requirements, 47 CFR 76, Subpart K, to prevent interference
with the transmission or reception of over-the-air broadcast signals. A
grantee's system shall not cause interference with the ability of any
subscriber or non-subscriber to utilize his or her television receiver for any
lawful purpose. The connection of any cable input selector device or any
converter to a subscriber's terminal shall not be considered as interference
with the subscriber's ability to utilize his or her television receiver.
   (h)   Grantee to Take All Necessary Steps to Prevent Accidents. A grantee

work. Notification shall be by leaving an appropriate notice at the residence
(i.e. door hanger notice) and/or by first-class mail. In the event of a system
extension or rebuild, possibly affecting general system reception, a grantee
shall notify all of its subscribers, by first-class mail, stating the scope and
duration of the proposed extension or rebuild and its impacts at least fourteen
days prior to commencement of such work, with a follow-up door hanger notice
also being placed at subscribers' residences no later than forty-eight hours
prior to the commencement of the extension or rebuild work. (Ord. 98-05. Passed
4-15-98.)
805.08   REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO USE OF COUNTY STREETS AND PUBLIC RIGHTS OF
WAY.
   (a)   During Construction, Reconstruction or Maintenance of System, Grantee
Shall Not Obstruct Public Ways Without Prior Consent of Authorities. In
connection with the construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance,
repair, or removal of the system, a grantee shall give due regard to the
aesthetics of the franchise areas and shall not obstruct the public ways,
streets, railways, passenger travel, or other traffic to, from or within the
County, without prior consent of the appropriate State and/or County
authorities. In addition:
      (1)   All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment
erected by a grantee within the County shall be so located as to cause minimum
interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin any streets or public way.
      (2)   In case of any disturbance to any public way, street, easement,
paved area or other property, a grantee, at its own cost and expense, and in a
manner and time period approved by the County, shall replace and restore such
public rights-of-way in as good a condition as before the work involving such
disturbance was done.
   (b)   Permits Required to be Obtained Prior to Any Physical Work Being
Performed in Public Rights-of-Way. A grantee or its authorized contractors must
obtain permits from the Department of Building and Development prior to any
physical work being performed in the public rights-of-way, or on County-owned
property. Permits will be issued to a grantee or its contractors only on
approved plans by approved contractors, which plans must be submitted
concurrently with or prior to the request for the construction permit. All work
will be done in accordance with the County's Facility Standards Manual and must
comply with all applicable law. All physical work to be performed in the public
rights-of-way also requires permission from the Virginia Department of
Transportation. Evidence of such permission shall be submitted in conjunction
with each request for a permit submitted to the Department of Building and
Development pursuant to this section.
   (c)   Grantee to Prepare Detailed Maps of Affected Portion of the System
Prior to Issuance of Permit for Construction or Reconstruction. A grantee shall
cause detailed maps of the affected portion of the cable system, showing
materials of construction, amplifier, and power supply locations, to be filed
in the office of the Director of Building and Development prior to the issuance
of a permit for construction or reconstruction. Prior to requesting the
issuance of a permit for the installation of any facility or apparatus in
accordance with the provisions of this section, a grantee shall file such maps
with all public agencies whose facilities are affected by such installation.
   (d)   Upon Undergrounding of Utility Lines, Grantee Shall Concurrently Place
Lines Underground in Conduits at Depth Approved by Director of Building and
Development or Designee. Trunk, feeder and drop cable may be constructed
overhead where poles now exist and electrical or telephone lines or both are
now overhead, but where electrical or telephone lines are now underground, all
trunk, feeder and drop cable shall be constructed underground at such depths
and locations as shall be approved by the Director of Building and Development
or his or her designee. Whenever and wherever electrical lines and telephone
lines are moved from overhead to underground placement in an area, all cable
system facilities and plants in that area shall be similarly and concurrently
moved underground by the grantee, at the grantee's sole cost and expense at
such depths and locations as shall be approved by the Director of Building and
Development or his or her designee.
   (e)   Grantee May be Required to Move its Facilities to Accommodate Changes
in Public Improvements. A grantee shall from time to time protect, support,
temporarily dislocate, or temporarily or permanently, as may be required,
remove or relocate, without expense to the County or any other governmental
entity, any facilities installed, used, or maintained under a franchise, if and
when made necessary by any lawful change of grade, alignment, or width of any
public street by the County or any other governmental entity, or made necessary
by any other public improvement or alteration in, under, on, upon or about any
public street or other public property, whether such public improvement or
alteration is at the instance of the County or another governmental entity, and
whether such improvement or alteration is for a governmental or proprietary
function, or made necessary by traffic conditions, public safety, street
vacation or any other public project or purpose of the County or any other
governmental entity. The decision of the Director of Building and Development
under this section, absent review by the County Board of Supervisors, shall be
final and binding on a grantee.
   (f)   Grantee Shall Obtain Prior Approval Before Altering Any Publicly Owned
Facility or Any Public Utility Facility; Alterations to be at Cost of Grantee.
In connection with the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, or removal
of the system, a grantee shall, at its own cost and expense, protect any and
all existing structures belonging to the Federal, State or County government or
to any public utility. A grantee shall obtain the prior approval of the
affected governmental agency or public utility and submit evidence of such
approval to the County before altering any water main, sewage or storm drainage
system, or any other publicly owned structure or public utility facility in any
public way or street, because of the presence of the system in the public ways
or streets. Any such alteration shall be made by a grantee, at its sole cost
and expense, and in a manner reasonably prescribed by the County. A grantee
shall also be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace or repair and
restore to as close to its prior condition as is reasonably possible and in a
manner reasonably specified by the County, any public way, street or any
Municipal structure involved in the construction of the system that may become
disturbed or damaged as a result of any work thereon by or on behalf of the
grantee.
   (g)   Grantee Shall Temporarily Move its Wires to Permit Moving of
Buildings. A grantee shall, at the request of any person holding a moving
permit issued by the County, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the
moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or
lowering of wires shall be paid to the grantee by the person requesting the
same, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in
advance. The grantee shall be given not less then fourteen days notice to
arrange for such temporary wire changes.
   (h)   Grantee Shall Repair and Restore Damage to County Facilities and Shall
Maintain Restoration. In the event that a grantee, during construction,
installation, inspection or repair of its facilities, causes damage to
pavement, sidewalks, driveways, landscaping or other property, the grantee or
the authorized agent shall, at its own expense and in a manner approved by the
County, replace and restore such places to the same condition which existed
before said work was commenced. The grantee shall further continue to maintain
all such restoration in the condition approved by the County.
   (i)   Failure by Grantee to Complete Required Work in Any Street or Other
Public Place Can Result in County Causing Work to be Done at Expense of
Grantee. Notwithstanding any franchise provision regarding liquidated damages,
and under normal operating conditions, upon failure of the grantee to complete
any work required by law, or by the provisions of a franchise, to be done in
any street or other public place, within ten days following due notice and to
the satisfaction of the Director of Building and Development, the County may,
at its option, cause such work to be done and the grantee shall pay to the
County the cost thereof, in the itemized amounts reported by the Director of
Building and Development to the grantee within ten days after receipt of such
itemized report, or, at the County's option, the County may demand of the
grantee the estimated cost of such work as estimated by the Director of
Building and Development, and such shall be paid by the grantee to the County
within ten days of such demand; upon award of any contract or contracts for
such work, the grantee shall pay to the County within ten days of demand any
additional amount necessary to provide for cost of such work. Upon completion
of such work, the grantee shall pay to the County or the County shall refund to
the grantee such sums so that the total received and retained by the County
shall equal the cost of such work. “Cost”, as used herein, shall include
fifteen percent for the County's overhead expense.
   (j)   County May Remove Grantee's Facilities as May be Required During
Emergencies. The County reserves the right to remove any portion of a grantee's
equipment and facilities as may be required in any emergency as determined by
the County without liability for interruption of cable service, and the County
shall not be obligated to restore cable service or to pay the costs of expenses
of restoring cable service.
   (k)   Cost of Tree Trimming is to be at Expense of Grantee; County Has
Option to Decide Whether County or Grantee Does the Trimming. A grantee shall
notify the County regarding the need to trim trees upon and overhanging public
rights-of-way so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in
contact with the wires and cables of the grantee or creating a safety hazard.
At the option of the County, such trimming may be done by the County at the
expense of the grantee, or by the grantee, under the County's supervision and
direction, at the expense of the grantee. When authorized, such trimming shall
be limited to the area required for clear cable passage and shall not include
major structural branches which materially alter the appearance and natural
growth habits of the tree. If such trimming is not performed by the County, the
grantee shall be responsible for any and all damage to any tree as a result of
trimming, or to the land surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or
removed, or for damage to property or person caused by such trimming and
removal of any tree.
   (l)   Grantee Shall Remove System From Any Public Street Following
Termination or Expiration of Franchise. In the event that the use of a part of
the cable system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of
twelve months, or in the event such cable system or property has been installed
in any street or public place without complying with the requirements of the
franchise, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or has expired
without renewal, a grantee shall promptly, at its own expense, upon being given
ten days written notice from the Director of Building and Development, remove
from the streets or public places all such property and poles of such cable
system, other than any which the Director of Building and Development may
permit to be abandoned in place. In the event of such removal, a grantee shall
promptly restore the street or other area from which such property has been
removed to a condition satisfactory to the Director of Building and
Development. The Director of Building and Development shall not give such
notice if the property or poles are needed to ensure continuous uninterrupted
service or if the County chooses to exercise its right to purchase the
grantee's system pursuant to Section
805.16.
   (m)   Grantee's Property May be Considered Abandoned Sixty Days After
Termination or Expiration of Franchise. Any property of a grantee remaining in
place sixty days after the termination or expiration of a franchise may, at the
option of the County Board of Supervisors, be declared permanently abandoned.
Once declared abandoned, the grantee shall have thirty days to remove the
property. The Director of Building and Development may, upon the request of the
grantee, extend such time for a period not to exceed an additional sixty days.
Any property not removed shall, at the option of the County, be declared
forfeited to the County.
   (n)   Abandonment in Place Shall be Done at Direction of Department of
Building and Development; Ownership of Property Shall be Transferred to County.
Any property which a grantee wishes to abandon in place shall be abandoned in
such a manner as the Department of Building and Development or its designee
shall prescribe. Such abandonment of the property of a grantee in place shall
require a grantee to submit to the County an instrument in writing, to be
approved by the County Attorney, transferring to the County the ownership of
such property. If such an instrument is not received within thirty days of the
abandonment, the property shall, at the option of the County, be declared
forfeited to the County.

possible and, except in emergency situations or to the extent necessary to
correct the affected subscribers' service problems, only after a minimum of
forty-eight hours prior notice to subscribers and the County of the anticipated
service interruption, provided, however, that planned maintenance that does not
require more than two hours interruption of service and that occurs between the
hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. of the following day shall not require
such notice to subscribers, but shall require notice to the County no less than

standards which are to be certified quarterly by the grantee to the County.
      (1)   The grantee shall maintain local, toll-free or collect call
telephone access lines which will be available to subscribers twenty-four hours

      (8)   At least ninety percent of the time, any service call request
involving a problem other than an outage shall be scheduled at the customer's
convenience within a two-hour window on the next business day (defined as
Monday through Saturday, exclusive of holidays) between the hours of 8:00 a.m.
and 5:00 p.m. A grantee may schedule service calls and other installation
activities outside of normal business hours for the express convenience of the
customer.
      (9)   Under normal operating conditions, a grantee may not cancel an
appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day
prior to the scheduled appointment. If a grantee representative is running late

prior to 11:00 p.m. shall be responded to immediately, regardless of the day of
the week.
      (11)   The business day following each service call report that is
received and acted upon during the time an answering service is being used, a
company staff member shall follow up to verify that the reported problem has
been corrected.
      (12)   Drop wires in underground service areas that are temporarily
placed above ground shall be buried within fourteen calendar days of the date

of thirty days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control
of the cable operator. In addition, the grantee shall notify subscribers thirty
days in advance of any significant changes in other information required by the
preceding paragraph.
      (18)   Bills shall be clear, concise, and understandable. Bills must be
fully itemized with itemizations, including, but not being limited to, basic
and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills shall clearly
delineate all activity during the billing period, including operational
charges, rebates, and credits. In case of a billing dispute, a grantee must
respond to a written complaint from a subscriber within thirty days.
      (19)   A grantee shall provide a subscriber with a credit or rebate for a
service outage that has been caused by a failure of the cable system. System
failures caused by normal operating conditions which were not the fault of or
under the control of the grantee are not subject to a rebate or credit by the
grantee except as stated below. In any given month, subscribers shall
automatically be compensated through the use of a rebate for cable service
outages lasting longer than twelve hours. For an outage of twelve to twenty-
four hours, the credit or rebate shall be calculated at twenty percent of the
subscriber's monthly cable bill for that period. For outages in excess of
forty-eight hours, the credit or rebate shall be calculated at 100 percent of
the bill. This policy shall be clearly stated to a subscriber when he or she is
reporting an outage and described in the annual subscriber notice (see
paragraph (a)(16) hereof).
      (20)   Refund checks shall be issued promptly, but not later than:
         A.   The customer's next billing cycle following resolution of the
request or thirty days, whichever is earlier; or
         B.   Upon the return of the equipment supplied by the cable operator
if service is terminated.
      (21)   Credits or rebates will be issued no later than the customer's
next billing cycle following the determination that a credit or rebate is
warranted.
   (b)   Exceptions. Nothing in this chapter is intended to prevent or
prohibit:
      (1)   The County and a grantee from agreeing to customer service
requirements that exceed the standards set forth in this chapter;
      (2)   The County from enacting or enforcing any consumer protection law;
or
      (3)   The establishment or enforcement of any ordinance or regulation
concerning customer service that imposes customer service requirements that
exceed or address matters not addressed by the standards set forth in this
chapter.
   (c)   Enforcement.
      (1)   A grantee shall file with the County, on a quarterly basis, within
thirty days following March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each
year, throughout the term of a franchise agreement, a notarized statement
signed by an officer or local system manager demonstrating and certifying
compliance with these customer service standards.
      (2)   An officer or local system manager who knowingly and/or
intentionally signs a false certificate shall be guilty of a Class 1
misdemeanor.
      (3)   Failure to file a certificate within the timeline specified in
paragraph (c)(1) hereof shall subject a grantee to pay a civil forfeiture to
the County of five hundred dollars ($500.00).
      (4)   A grantee in non-compliance with the specified customer service
standards shall, on a quarterly basis, and in conjunction with the filing of
the statement of compliance required under paragraph (c)(1) hereof, file with
the County a statement specifying areas of noncompliance along with a remedial
plan. Failing to file a non-compliance statement and a remedial plan shall
subject a grantee to pay a civil forfeiture to the County of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) per day. Failure of a grantee to remedy such non-compliance
as set forth in the remedial plan shall be deemed a breach of the customer
service standards set forth in this section and the County Administrator/
Designee may invoke the liquidated damages provision of the franchise
agreement, without prejudice to any other remedy otherwise available to the
County.
   (d)   Grantee to Furnish Service to Each Person in Franchise Area Making
Request for Service. A grantee shall furnish and maintain cable service to each
person within the franchise area who makes a bona fide request to receive such
service that is based upon the requirements of this chapter. Nothing in a
franchise agreement shall limit the right of the grantee to deny service to any
person which has a negative credit or service history with the grantee, which
may include non-payment of bills or theft or damage to the grantee's equipment,
or who has threatened or assaulted employees of the grantee in the course of
their employment, provided that in the event service is denied, the grantee
will give written notice to the person requesting service of his or her right
to appeal to the County the grantee's decision to deny service, and of the
County's authority to reverse the grantee's decision in instances where it is
determined by the County that the grantee has acted unreasonably.

a written certificate signed by the County Administrator/Designee certifying
that the grantee has failed to comply with the franchise agreement and/or this
chapter, stating the nature of the noncompliance and stating the amount being
drawn. Examples of the nature of the noncompliance for drawing upon the letter
of credit include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Failure of the grantee to pay to the County any franchise fees,
taxes, liens or other fees after written notice of delinquency;
         B.   Failure of the grantee to pay to the County any amounts due and
owing by reason of the indemnity provisions of Section
805.06;
         C.   Failure of the grantee to pay to the County any liquidated
damages due and owing pursuant to a franchise agreement;
         D.   Failure to make any payment required by an agreement within the
time fixed therein;
         E.   Failure to pay to the County, after receipt of written notice,
any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the County has been compelled to
pay or has incurred by the reason of any material act or default by the
grantee;
         F.   Failure to comply after receipt of written notice from the County
Administrator, with any material provisions of an agreement or this chapter
which the County Administrator reasonably determines can be remedied by an
expenditure of an amount from the letter of credit or other instrument.
      (2)   In the event of such noncompliance, the County Administrator may
order the withdrawal of the appropriate amount of liquidated damages,
penalties, fees or otherwise from the letter of credit or other instrument for
payment to the County, provided that, prior to each such withdrawal; (i) the
grantee shall be afforded an opportunity to cure any of said failures within
thirty days after written notice from the County Administrator that the
withdrawal is to be made; or (ii) if such cure cannot be reasonably
accomplished within such thirty days, then the grantee shall have a reasonable
time to cure, provided that the grantee commences such cure within such thirty
days and diligently pursues such cure to completion.
      (3)   A letter of credit shall be replenished to the original amount
following any draw down.
   The grantee shall structure the letter of credit in such a manner so that if
the County at any time draws upon the letter of credit, the amount of available
credit shall automatically increase to the extent necessary to replenish that
portion of the available credit exhausted by the honoring of the draft. The
intent of this subsection is to make available to the County at all times a
letter of credit in the amount specified in the franchise agreement.
   (c)   County's Rights With Respect to Letter of Credit Are in Addition to
Other Rights. The rights reserved to the County with respect to the letter of
credit are in addition to all other rights of the County, whether reserved by a
franchise agreement or authorized by law, and no action or proceeding against a
letter of credit shall affect any other right the County may have.
(Ord. 98-05. Passed 4-15-98.)
805.15   LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.
   (a)   Parties Shall Agree to Specific Liquidated Damages to be Paid by
Grantee for Certain Delays or Nonperformance. A grantee's failure to comply
with any timing or performance requirements set forth in a franchise agreement
will result in damage to the County, the amount of which will be impracticable
to ascertain. Therefore, the County and the grantee will negotiate the amount
of liquidated damages to be set forth in a franchise agreement. Every franchise
agreement shall provide that the County's recovery of such damages shall be
without prejudice to any other remedy the County may have.
   (b)   Procedures Established to Assure Grantee of Due Process and
Opportunity to Cure Problem Before Damages Assessed. If the County
Administrator/Designee, following prior reasonable notice to a grantee to cure
any problem that might result in liquidated damages, concludes that a grantee
is liable for liquidated damages pursuant to the franchise agreement, he or she
shall issue to the grantee, by certified mail, a notice of intention to assess
liquidated damages. The notice shall set forth the basis of the assessment, and
shall inform the grantee that liquidated damages will be assessed from the date
of the notice unless the assessment notice is appealed for hearing before the
County Board of Supervisors and the Board rules (1) that the violation has been
corrected, or (2) that an extension of the time or other relief should be
granted, or (3) the Board disagrees with the findings of the County
Administrator. If the grantee desires a hearing before the Board of
Supervisors, it shall send a written notice of appeal, by certified mail, to
the County Administrator within ten days of the date on which the County
Administrator sent the notice of intention to assess liquidated damages. After
the hearing, if the Board sustains, in whole or in part, the County
Administrator's assessment of liquidated damages, the County Administrator may
at any time thereafter draw upon the letter of credit required by Section
805.14. Unless the Board indicates to the contrary, said liquidated damages
shall be assessed beginning with the date on which the County Administrator
sent the notice of intention to assess liquidated damages and continuing
thereafter until such time as the violation ceases, as determined by the County
Administrator.
(Ord. 98-05. Passed 4-15-98.)
805.16   FORFEITURE AND TERMINATION.
   (a)   Franchise May be Terminated for Material Breach of Terms and
Conditions. Subject to the grantee's right to cure in Section
805.15(b), and in addition to all other rights and powers retained by the
County, the County reserves the right to terminate a franchise and all rights
and privileges of the grantee in the event of a material breach of this chapter
or a franchise agreement. A material breach by a grantee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   Substantial and/or repeated violations of any material provision of
this chapter or the franchise agreement or any material rule, order, regulation
or determination of the County made pursuant to a franchise;
      (2)   Attempt to evade any material provision of this chapter or a
franchise agreement, or practice any fraud or deceit upon the County or the
subscribers of the cable system;
      (3)   Failure to begin or complete cable system construction,
reconstruction or cable system extension as provided under a franchise
agreement;
      (4)   Failure to provide cable service for ninety-six consecutive hours,
except when there is just cause and/or when approval of such interrupted
service is obtained from the County;
      (5)   Substantial failure to provide the financial information required
by this chapter and/or the franchise agreement;
      (6)   Substantial failure to satisfy the requirements regarding system
characteristics or repeated failure to meet the technical performance standards
specified in a franchise agreement;
      (7)   Abandonment of the system, in whole or in material part, without
the prior written consent of the County;
      (8)   Substantial and/or repeated failure to comply with the leased
access requirements of Section 612 [47 U.S.C. 532], Title VI, of the
Communications Act of 1934;
      (9)   Substantial failure to supply the access channels and other support
and any related services, equipment and facilities as required in a franchise
agreement;
      (10)   Repeated imposition of any fee, charge, deposit, or associated
term or condition, for any service which is not consistent with the provisions
of a franchise agreement, or of which there has repeatedly and unjustifiably
been no notification to the County;
      (11)   Substantial and/or repeated failure to comply with the consumer
service standards and requirements set forth in this chapter and a franchise
agreement;
      (12)   The taking of any material action which requires the approval or
consent of the County without having first obtained said approval or consent;
      (13)   Any material misrepresentation, made by or on behalf of a grantee
in its proposal to obtain a franchise, or in connection with the negotiation or
re-negotiation of, or any amendment or other modification to a franchise
agreement, to the extent that any such misrepresentation was relied upon by the
County;
      (14)   There is made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or an
appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the grantee,
whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the
benefit of creditors, or a foreclosure or other action or proceeding, unless
the applicable conditions set forth in subsections (i) and (j) hereof are
fulfilled.
   (b)   Procedures Outlined Leading to Possible Termination of Franchise. Upon
determining that a material breach has occurred, the County Administrator/
Designee may make a written demand that a grantee correct such a material
breach. If the violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect by a grantee
continues for a period of ninety days following such written demand without
written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively
and expeditiously pursued, the Board of Supervisors shall hold a public
hearing, with public notice as required by Section 15.2-1427 of the Code of
Virginia, on the issue of termination of a franchise. The County Administrator/
Designee shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least twenty days prior
to the date of such Board meeting, a written notice of intent to request such
termination and the time and place of the meeting.
   (c)   County Board of Supervisors Shall Hear and Consider Issues and
Determine if a Violation Has Occurred. The County Board of Supervisors shall
hear and consider the issue and shall hear any person interested therein, and
shall determine, whether or not any violation by a grantee has occurred. If,
after considering the County Administrator's request for termination of the
franchise and hearing all interested parties, the Board determines that the
noncompliance of the grantee was with just cause, it shall direct the grantee
to comply within such time, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as
are reasonable.
   (d)   County Board of Supervisors May Declare Franchise Terminated. If,
after holding a public hearing, the County Board of Supervisors shall determine
that a violation by a grantee exists, and the Board makes findings that such
violation was without just cause and was the fault of the grantee and within
its control, the County Board of Supervisors, may declare that the franchise of
the grantee be terminated, and instruct the grantee to promptly remove from the
public way all of its cable television facilities in accordance with Section
805.08 of this chapter. The Board may seek legal and equitable relief in order
to ensure compliance with this provision. In the alternative, the Board may
adopt a resolution which invokes the County's right to purchase the assets of
the grantee's cable television system at a price not to exceed its fair market
value adjusted downward for the harm to the County or subscribers, if any,
resulting from the grantee's breach of its franchise agreement or violation of
this chapter and as further adjusted to account for other equitable factors
that may be considered consistent with 47 U.S.C. 547. Such purchase must be
consummated one year from the date of the franchise revocation, unless
challenged in Court, in which case such year shall run from the date of entry
of a final Court Order. The termination of the franchise shall in no way affect
any of the rights of the County under the franchise agreement or any provision
of law.
   (e)   Summary Revocation. If the grantee arbitrarily or capriciously
discontinues all cable service to some or all of its subscribers, the Board of
Supervisors may, by resolution, after at least ten days notice to the Grantee
and an opportunity for the grantee to be heard, declare the grantee's franchise
immediately terminated and the County may seek appropriate judicial injunctive
relief and may proceed to exercise its rights and powers as provided for in
this chapter.
   (f)   Transfer of Ownership to County.
      (1)   If, in lieu of termination and as provided in subsection (d)
hereof, the County elects to purchase the grantee's cable television system and
the fair market value adjusted downward for the harm to the County or
subscribers, if any, resulting from the grantee's breach of its franchise
agreement or violation of this chapter and as further adjusted to account for
other equitable factors that may be considered consistent with 47 U.S.C. 547,
cannot be agreed upon, the final price shall be determined by a panel of
arbitrators following the Federal guidelines established in 47 U.S.C. 547. The
panel shall be composed of one member appointed by the County, one member
appointed by the grantee and a third member chosen by the first two. The
expenses of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators, shall be
borne by the parties in such manner as the arbitrators provide in their award,
provided, however, that the County shall not be obligated for more than one-
half of the expenses. If the County does not accept the award of the
arbitrators within ninety days after the rendering of the decision, the rights
of the County to purchase the cable television system shall expire.
      (2)   Upon payment of the purchase price, the grantee shall immediately
transfer to the County possession and title to all facilities and property,
real and personal, related to the cable television system, free of all liens
and encumbrances not agreed to be assumed by the County in lieu of some form of
the purchase price.
   (g)   County Assignment of Purchase Rights. The County may assign its
purchase rights to a successor grantee, selected by the County, in a manner not
inconsistent with this chapter.
   (h)   Grantee's Obligation as Trustee.
      (1)   Until the grantee transfers to the County, or to a new grantee,
possession and title to all assets, real and personal, related to its cable
television system, the grantee shall, as trustee for its successors in
interest, continue to operate the cable television system under this chapter
and the franchise agreement and to provide the regular subscriber service and
any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. During such
interim period, the grantee shall not sell any of the system assets or make any
physical, material, administrative or operational change that would tend to
degrade the quality of service to the subscribers, decrease income or
materially increase expenses, without the express written permission of the
County or its assignee. The County may seek legal and equitable relief to
enforce the provisions of this subsection.
      (2)   For its management services during such interim period, the grantee
is entitled to receive, as compensation, the net profit, as deemed by generally
accepted accounting principles, generated during the period between the date
the grantee received written notice from the County of its intent to purchase
the grantee's cable television system or the expiration date of the franchise,
whichever is earlier, and the payment of the purchase price. Such management
services shall not be continued without the grantee's consent for more than
thirty-six months. This section does not limit the County's right to forthwith
terminate the grantee's franchise and have the system removed, pursuant to this
chapter.
   (i)   Franchise May Cease and Terminate 120 Days After Appointment of
Receivers. Any franchise granted shall, at the option of County, cease and
terminate 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee
or trustees to take over and conduct the business of the grantee whether in a
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding, unless
such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
      (1)   Such receivers or trustees shall have within 120 days, after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of
this chapter and a franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivers or
trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all defaults under the
franchise; and,
      (2)   Such receivers or trustees shall have within 120 days executed an
agreement duly approved by the Court having jurisdiction, whereby such
receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and every term,
provision, and limitation of the franchise agreement.
   (j)   Procedure if a Foreclosure Occurs. In the case of a foreclosure or
other involuntary sale of the plant, property, and equipment of the grantee, or
any part thereof, County may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and
to the purchaser at such sale, in which event the franchise and rights and
privileges of the grantee shall cease and terminate thirty days after service
of such notice unless:
      (1)   The County has approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in
the manner in this chapter provided; and
      (2)   Such successful purchaser shall have covenanted and agreed with
County to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise
agreement.
(Ord. 98-05. Passed 4-15-98.)
805.17   WAIVERS.
   (a)   Any provision of this chapter may be waived for good cause shown, at
the sole discretion of the County, by resolution of the County Board of
Supervisors.
   (b)   A grantee may submit a written request for a waiver of a chapter
requirement to the County Board of Supervisors at any time during the franchise
term. Such request for a waiver shall be set for a public hearing, with notice
as required by Section 15.2-1427 of the Code of Virginia, and a decision shall
be made within 120 days following the submission of such request.
   (c)   The County Board of Supervisors may authorize the economic, technical,
or legal evaluation of such waiver request, and the grantee shall be required
to reimburse the County for any expenditure incurred by the County in
connection with such evaluation.
   (d)   This section is enacted solely for the convenience and benefit of the
grantor and shall not be construed in such a manner as to create any right or
entitlement for approval of a waiver request on the part of the grantee.
(Ord. 98-05. Passed 4-15-98.)
805.18   SUNDRY PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Every direction, notice or order by the County to be served upon a
grantee shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to the office specified
in the franchise agreement. Every notice served upon the County shall be
delivered or sent by first class mail to the County Administrator, Loudoun
County, Virginia.
   (b)   All provisions of this chapter shall apply to a grantee, its
successors, and assignees, as may be approved by County Board of Supervisors in
accordance with this chapter.
   (c)   The rights granted by this chapter are subject to all franchises and
permits heretofore or hereafter granted by the Board of Supervisors to use the
streets of the County by other public utility, public service corporations or
telecommunications providers. It is not intended by the grant of a franchise to
abridge the exercise of the police power heretofore or hereafter granted to the
County by the State. The grant of a franchise is subject to all ordinances and
resolutions of, or agreements adopted by, the Board of Supervisors of the
County, as the same now exist or may be hereafter amended, revised or codified,
in the lawful exercise of any other power granted to the County.
   (d)   Specific mention of the materiality of any of the provisions herein is
not intended to be exclusive of any others for the purpose of determining
whether any failure of compliance hereunder is material and substantial.
   (e)   If any particular section of this chapter, or the particular
application thereof, shall be held invalid, the remaining provisions, and their
application, shall not be affected thereby.
   (f)   A grantee, upon its acceptance of a franchise, shall be bound by the
provisions of this chapter, all responses, statements, and all matters agreed
upon in a franchise agreement.
   (g)   A grantee shall assume the cost of any public notice required by law.
   (h)   In the event that any provision of the Cable Acts of 1984, 1992, or
1996, or other statute, law or regulation, which is relied on herein or in any
agreement for any definition or requirement, is repealed, then the language of
such provision at the time of such repeal shall nevertheless continue to apply
for purposes of this chapter or any agreement, regardless of such repeal,
except as otherwise provided herein or in any agreement or as prohibited by
such subsequent repeal or amendment.
   (i)   The rights and remedies reserved to the County by this chapter are
cumulative and shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other
rights or remedies which the County may have with respect to the subject matter
of this chapter. A waiver of any right or remedy by a party at one time shall
not affect the exercise of said right or remedy or any other right or other
remedy by such party at any other time. The failure of the County to take any
action in the event of a material breach by the grantee shall not be construed
or otherwise be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right of the County to
take such action at any other time in the event that said material breach has
not been cured, or with respect to any other material breach by the grantee.
   (j)   In the event that, after the effective date of this chapter, any
court, agency, commission, legislative body, or other authority of competent
jurisdiction declares this chapter invalid, in whole or in part, the portion of
this chapter which is not held to be invalid shall continue in full force and
effect.
   (k)   In the event that, after the effective date of this chapter, any
court, agency, commission, legislative body or other authority of competent
jurisdiction declares or requires the grantee either to: (1) perform any act
which is inconsistent with any provision of this chapter or (2) cease
performing any act required by any provision of this chapter and the grantee
intends to exercise its rights pursuant to such declaration, the grantee shall
so notify the County of said declaration or requirement.
   (l)   The headings contained in this chapter and any agreement are to
facilitate reference only, do not form a part of this chapter or an agreement,
and shall not in any way affect the construction or interpretation hereof.

      (1)   A grantee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with

without limitation all rights the County may have under 47 U.S.C. Section 552
and Sections 15.2-2108.1 and 15.2-403 of the Code of Virginia. Nothing in a

codes and ordinances of the County regarding permits, zoning, fees to be paid,
or manner of construction, installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of

pursuant to Section
809.05 within 150 days of the date of enactment. Failure of an existing
operator to submit an application within the 150-day time-frame shall be
grounds for denial of any subsequent application and an order of the County for
the removal of any facilities installed by such operator in the public right-
of-way. The County reserves the right to reject any such application and order
the removal of any facilities installed by an applicant, if (i) the application

(Ord. 23-07. Passed 3-15-23.)
826.05   C-PACE LOAN REQUIREMENTS; PROGRAM FEES; REPORTING; PROGRAM
ADMINISTRATOR; PROGRAM GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Source of Loans. C-PACE Loans shall be originated by Capital
Providers. The County and/or its respective governmental entities shall have no
obligation to originate or guarantee any C-PACE Loans.
   (b)   C-PACE Loan Amount Thresholds. The minimum Loan Amount that may be
financed for each Project is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). There is no
maximum aggregate amount that may be financed with respect to an Eligible
Property, except as stipulated in the Program Guidelines. There shall be no
limit on the total value of all C-PACE Loans issued under the C- PACE Program.
   (c)   C-PACE Loan Refinancing or Reimbursement. The Program Administrator
may approve a Loan application submitted within two (2) years of the County's
issuance of a certificate of occupancy or other evidence that the Eligible
Improvements comply substantially with the plans and specifications previously
approved by the County and that such Loan may refinance or reimburse the
Property Owner for the total costs of such Eligible Improvements.
   (d)   C-PACE Loan Interest. The interest rate of a C-PACE Loan shall be as
set forth in the C-PACE Documents.
   (e)   C-PACE Loan term. The term of a C-PACE Loan shall not exceed the
weighted average Useful Life of the Eligible Improvements, as determined by the
Program Administrator.
   (f)   Apportionment of Costs. All of the costs incidental to the financing,
administration, collection, and/or enforcement of the C-PACE Loan shall be
borne by the Property Owner.
   (g)   Financing Agreements. Capital Providers may use their own Financing
Agreements for C-PACE Loans, but the Financing Agreement may not conflict with
the provisions of this chapter, the C-PACE Act, or the C-PACE Program
Agreement. To the extent of any conflict, this chapter, the C-PACE Act, and the
C-PACE Program Agreement shall prevail.
   (h)   C-PACE Program Agreement. In order to participate in the C-PACE
Program, Property Owner and Capital Provider shall enter into a C-PACE Program
Agreement, which sets forth certain terms and conditions for participation in
the C-PACE Program. The Program Manager is authorized to approve the C-PACE
Loan and execute the C-PACE Program Agreement on behalf of the County without
further action by the Board. The Treasurer is also authorized to execute the C-
PACE Program Agreement without further action by the Board. The C-PACE Program
Agreement shall be binding upon the parties thereto and their respective
successors and assigns until the C-PACE Loan is paid in full. The Program
Administrator may modify the C-PACE Program Agreement as necessary to further
the Statewide Program's purpose and to encourage Program participation, so long
as such modifications do not conflict with the Program Guidelines, this
chapter, the Locality Agreement or the C-PACE Act.
   (i)   Repayment of C-PACE Loan; Collection of C-PACE Payments. C-PACE Loans
will be repaid by the Property Owner through C-PACE Payments made in the
amounts and at such times as set forth in the Assessment Payment Schedule, the
C-PACE Documents, and Program Guidelines. The Capital Provider shall be
responsible, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the C-PACE Program
Agreement and other C-PACE Documents, for the servicing of the C-PACE Loans and
the collection of C-PACE Payments. If a Capital Provider fails to service a C-
PACE Loan, such C-PACE Loan shall be serviced by the Program Administrator.
Nothing herein shall prevent the Capital Provider or the Program Administrator
from directly billing and collecting the C-PACE Payments from the Property
Owner to the extent permitted by the C-PACE Act or other applicable law. The
enforcement of C-PACE Loans and their C- PACE Documents during an event of
default thereunder is governed by Section 826-06(e).
   (j)   C-PACE Loan Assumed. A party which acquires a Property which is
subject to a C-PACE Lien, whether it obtained ownership of the Property
voluntarily or involuntarily, becomes the Property Owner under the C-PACE
Documents and, by virtue of the C-PACE Lien running with the land, assumes the
obligation to repay all remaining unpaid C-PACE Payments which are due and
which accrue during such successor Property Owner's period of ownership. Only
the current C-PACE Payment and any Delinquent Payments, together with any
penalties, fees, and costs of collection, shall be payable at the settlement of
a Property upon sale or transfer, unless otherwise agreed to by the Capital
Provider.
   (k)   Transfer of C-PACE Loans. C-PACE Loans may be transferred, assigned,
or sold by a Capital Provider to another Capital Provider at any time until the
C-PACE Loan is paid in full provided that the Capital Provider shall (i) notify
the Property Owner and the Program Administrator of the transfer prior to the
billing date of the next C-PACE Payment due (and within thirty (30) days if the
C-PACE Loan is serviced by the Program Administrator), (ii) record a C-PACE
Assignment (CP) among the Land Records, and (iii) deliver a copy of the
recorded C-PACE Assignment (CP) to the Property Owner, the County, and the
Program Administrator. Recordation of the C-PACE Assignment (CP) shall
constitute an assumption by the new Capital Provider of the rights and
obligations of the original Capital Provider contained in the C-PACE Documents.
   (l)   Program Fees. The Statewide Program is self-financed through the
Program Fees charged to participating Property Owners, together with any funds
budgeted by the General Assembly to support the Statewide Program. The Program
Fees are established to cover the actual and reasonable costs to design and
administer the Statewide Program, including the compensation of a third-party
Program Administrator. The amount(s) of the Program Fees shall be set forth in
the Program Guidelines. Program Fees may be changed by the Program
Administrator from time to time and shall only apply to C-PACE Loans executed
after the date the revised fees are adopted.
   (m)   Locality Agreement. The County shall opt into the Statewide Program by
entering into the Locality Agreement, adopting the Statewide Program as the
County's own C-PACE Program. In accordance with the C-PACE Act, opting into the
C-PACE Program shall not require the County to conduct a competitive
procurement process. The Program Manager is authorized to execute the Locality
Agreement on behalf of the County without further action by the Board.
   (n)   Program Guidelines. The Program Administrator, under the direction of
and in consultation with Virginia Energy, has designed the Program Guidelines
to create an open, competitive, and efficient C-PACE Program. The Program
Administrator may modify the Program Guidelines from time to time, provided
such amendments are (i) consistent with the C-PACE Act and (ii) approved by
Virginia Energy before taking effect.
   (o)   Indemnification. The Program Administrator shall indemnify, defend,
and hold the County harmless against any claim brought against the County or
any liability imposed on the County as a result of any action or omission to
act by the Program Administrator.
(Ord. 23-07. Passed 3-15-23.)
826.06   LEVY OF ASSESSMENT; RECORDATION; PRIORITY; AMENDMENT; ENFORCEMENT AND
COLLECTION COSTS.
   (a)   Levy of Voluntary Special Assessment Lien. Each C-PACE Loan made under
the C- PACE Program shall be secured by a voluntary special assessment lien
(i.e., a C-PACE Lien) levied by the County against each Property benefitting
from the Eligible Improvements financed by such C-PACE Loan. The C-PACE Lien
shall be in the Loan Amount, but shall secure not only the principal of the C-
PACE Loan, but also all interest, delinquent interest, late fees, penalties,
Program Fees, and collection costs (including attorneys' fees and costs)
payable in connection therewith.
   (b)   Recordation of C-PACE Lien Certificate. Each C-PACE Lien shall be
evidenced by a C-PACE Lien Certificate in the Loan Amount, but shall also
expressly state that it also secures all interest, delinquent interest, late
fees, other types of fees, penalties and collection costs (including attorneys'
fees and costs) payable in connection therewith, and a copy of the Assessment
Payment Schedule shall be attached thereto as an exhibit. The Program Manager
is hereby authorized to, and shall promptly, execute the C-PACE Lien
Certificate on behalf of the County and deliver it to the Capital Provider,
without any further action by the Board. Upon the full execution of the C-PACE
Documents and funding of the C-PACE Loan, the Capital Provider shall cause the
recordation of the C-PACE Lien Certificate in the Land Records.
   (c)   Priority. The C-PACE Lien shall have the same priority as a real
property tax lien against real property, except that it shall have priority
over any previously recorded mortgage or deed of trust lien on the Property
only if prior to the recording of the C-PACE Lien, (i) Property Owner has
obtained a written Lender Consent, in a form and substance acceptable to the
holder of such prior mortgage or deed of trust in its sole and exclusive
discretion, executed by such lienholder and recorded with the C-PACE Lien
Certificate in the Land Records; and (ii) prior to the recording of the C-PACE
Lien Certificate, Property Owner has delivered an executed Property Owner
Certification to the County in connection with the C-PACE Loan closing. Only
the current C-PACE Payment and any Delinquent Payments shall constitute a first
lien on the Property. The C-PACE Lien shall run with the land and that portion
of the C- PACE Lien under the C-PACE Program Agreement that has not yet become
due shall not be eliminated by foreclosure of a real property tax lien.
   (d)   Amendment of Lien. Upon written request by a Capital Provider in
accordance with the Program Guidelines, the Program Manager, without any
further action by the Board, shall join with the Capital Provider and the
Property Owner in executing a C-PACE Amendment of the C-PACE Loan and the C-
PACE Lien after the closing of a C-PACE Loan. The C-PACE Amendment shall be
recorded in the Land Records.
   (e)   Enforcement and Collection Costs. In the event of Property Owner's
default under the terms of the C-PACE Documents, the County, acting by and
through the Treasurer, may enforce the C-PACE Lien for the amount of the
Delinquent Payments, late fees, penalties, interest, and any costs of
collection in the same manner that a property tax lien against real property
may be enforced under Title 58.1, Chapter 39, Article 4 of the Virginia Code.
If the County elects not to enforce the C-PACE Lien, which election shall be
made within thirty (30) days of receipt by the County from the Capital Provider
of notice of the Property Owner's default under the terms of the C-PACE
Documents, then the County, acting by and through the Treasurer, shall, within
fifteen (15) days of the County's determination not to enforce the C- PACE
Lien, assign the right to enforce the C-PACE Lien in accordance with the terms
of the C- PACE Documents to the Capital Provider by executing a C-PACE
Assignment (Locality) and delivering such instrument to the Capital Provider
for recordation in the Land Records. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, a
C-PACE Assignment (Locality) may be executed and recorded at any time during
the term of the C-PACE Loan, including at the C-PACE Loan's closing, regardless
of whether the C-PACE Loan is then in default. Upon such assignment and
recordation, the Capital Provider is authorized to, and shall, enforce the C-
PACE Lien according to the terms of the C-PACE Documents, in the same manner
that a property tax lien against real property may be enforced under Title
58.1, Chapter 39 of the Virginia Code, including the institution of suit in the
name of the County and its Treasurer, and this right to enforce expressly
includes authorization for the Capital Provider to engage legal counsel to
advise the Capital Provider and conduct all aspects of such enforcement. Such
legal counsel, being authorized to institute suit in the name of the County and
its Treasurer, shall have the status of "Special Counsel to the County and its
Treasurer" and an "attorney employed by the governing body," and possess all
the rights and powers of an attorney employed under Va. Code Secs. 58.1-3966
and 58.1-3969, with the express authority to exercise for the benefit of the
Capital Provider every power granted to a local government and/or its Treasurer
and its or their attorneys for the enforcement of a property tax lien under, or
in connection with, any provision contained in Title 58.1, Chapter 39, Article
4 of the Virginia Code. The County, on its behalf and on behalf of the
Treasurer, waives its right to require such legal counsel to post the optional
bond described in Va. Code Sec. 58.1-3966. All collection and enforcement costs
and expenses (including legal fees and costs), interest, late fees, other types
of fees, and penalties charged by the County or Capital Provider, as applicable
and consistent with the C- PACE Act and the Virginia Code, shall (i) be added
to the Delinquent Payments being collected, (ii) become part of the aggregate
amount sued for and collected, (iii) be added to the C-PACE Loan, and (iv) be
secured by the C-PACE Lien. Nothing herein shall prevent the Capital Provider
to which the C-PACE Lien has been assigned from enforcing the C-PACE Lien to
the fullest extent permitted by the C-PACE Documents, the C-PACE Act or general
law. The Property Owner of a Property being sold to pay Delinquent Payments, or
other interested party, may redeem the Property at any time prior to the
Property's sale, in accordance with Va. Code Secs. 58.1-3974 and 58.1-3975.

APPENDIX A. C-PACE PROGRAM AGREEMENT
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY ASSESSED
CLEAN ENERGY (C-PACE) FINANCING PROGRAM
C-PACE PROGRAM AGREEMENT
   THIS C-PACE PROGRAM AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of the date it is fully executed (the "Effective Date"), by and among the
[CITY/COUNTY/TOWN] OF [________], VIRGINIA, a political subdivision of the
Commonwealth of Virginia (the "[County/City/Town]"); the TREASURER OF THE
[CITY/COUNTY/TOWN] (the "Treasurer"); _________________________, a [state of
organization] [type of business entity] (the "Property Owner"); and
__________________________, a [state of organization] [type of business entity]
(the "Capital Provider"), and their respective successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Parties").
RECITALS:
   WHEREAS, §15.2-958.3 of the Virginia Code (the "C-PACE Act"), authorizes the
creation of a statewide Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy ("C-PACE")
Program (the "Statewide Program"), sponsored by Virginia Energy and managed by
the Virginia PACE Authority, its selected program administrator (the "Program
Administrator"), and authorizes Virginia localities to opt into the Statewide
Program instead of establishing a stand-alone C-PACE Program for the locality;
and
   WHEREAS, the Statewide Program facilitates Capital Providers making C-PACE
Loans to Property Owners to enable the Property Owners to make Eligible
Improvements to Eligible Properties; and
   WHEREAS, each C-PACE Loan is secured by a Property Owner's voluntary grant
of a C-PACE Lien on an Eligible Property to the locality in which the Eligible
Property is located; and
   WHEREAS, the [County/City/Town] has determined to enable Property Owners to
obtain C-PACE Loans for Eligible Improvements located on Eligible Properties in
the [County/City/Town] by causing the [County/City/Town] to opt into the
Statewide Program, adopting the Statewide Program as the [County/City/Town]'s
own C-PACE Program, and to implement such determination, the [Board of
Supervisors/Council] of the [County/City/Town] has adopted Chapter _____ of the
[Code/Ordinances] of the [County/City/Town] (the "Ordinance"); and
   WHEREAS, pursuant to the C-PACE Act, the Ordinance, a Locality Agreement
between Virginia Energy and the [County/City/Town] and the Program Guidelines,
the Parties are required to enter into a written agreement specifying the terms
and conditions for participating in the Statewide Program;
   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein and to implement the purposes of the C-PACE Act and the Ordinance,
the Parties hereby agree as follows:
   Section 1 - Definitions.
   Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms in this Agreement shall
have the meanings given them in the Ordinance.
   Section 2 - Representations and Covenants.
   (a)   Property Owner represents and covenants that it is the fee simple
record owner of the Eligible Property more particularly described in Exhibit A
hereto (the "Property").
   (b)   Property Owner represents and covenants that (i) it has applied to
participate in the Statewide Program, (ii) the Program Administrator has given
notice to the [City/County/Town] of its approval of Property Owner's
application for C-PACE financing and (iii) desires to obtain a C-PACE Loan to
construct or install certain Eligible Improvements on the Property.
   (c)   Property Owner represents and covenants that it has entered or will
enter into a Financing Agreement with the Capital Provider that sets forth the
terms of the C-PACE Loan. The Assessment Payment Schedule for the C-PACE Loan
is set forth in Exhibit B hereto. Property Owner and Capital Provider
acknowledge and agree that the Financing Agreement shall include only those
costs and fees (including Program Fees) for which a C-PACE Lien may be imposed
under the C-PACE Act and the Ordinance.
   (d)   The Parties acknowledge and agree that should Property Owner default
on the C-PACE Loan, the [County/City/Town], acting through its Treasurer, may
enforce the C-PACE Lien for the benefit of Capital Provider according to the C-
PACE Documents, the C-PACE Act, the Locality Agreement and the Ordinance. If
the [County/City/Town], acting through its Treasurer, determines not to enforce
the C-PACE Lien, which determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of
receipt by the [City/County/Town] from the Capital Provider of notice of the
Property Owner's default under the terms of the C-PACE Documents, then the
[County/City/Town] shall, within fifteen (15) days of the [County/City/Town]'s
determination not to enforce the C-PACE Lien, assign the right to enforce the
C-PACE Lien in accordance with the terms of the C-PACE Documents to the Capital
Provider by executing a C-PACE Assignment (Locality) and deliver such
instrument to the Capital Provider for recordation in the Land Records. The
preceding sentence notwithstanding, a C-PACE Assignment (Locality) may be
executed and recorded at any time during the term of the C-PACE Loan, including
at the C-PACE Loan's closing, regardless of whether the C-PACE Loan is then in
default.
   (e)   Property Owner and Capital Provider confirm that they have obtained
Lender Consents for each deed of trust or mortgage lien against the Property.
   Section 3 - Program Terms and Conditions.
   (a)   C-PACE Loan. The Capital Provider will provide financing for the
Property Owner's Eligible Improvements in accordance with the C-PACE Documents.
   (b)   Program Fee(s): Property Owner agrees that Program Fee(s) will be
[paid directly by Property Owner to the Program Administrator][deducted from C-
PACE Loan proceeds at funding and remitted by Capital Provider to the Program
Administrator][deducted from C-PACE Payments and remitted by Capital Provider
to the Program Administrator] in accordance with the C-PACE Documents and the
Program Guidelines and in the amount of $_______, as follows:
____________________________________ ____________________________________
____________________________________ ____________________________________
___________.
   (c)   Imposition of C-PACE Lien. In consideration for the C-PACE Loan
provided to Property Owner under the Program, Property Owner hereby requests
and authorizes the [County/City/Town] to levy a C-PACE Lien against the
Property in the Loan Amount, together with all interest, delinquent interest,
late fees, other types of fees, penalties and collection costs (including
attorneys' fees and costs) payable in connection therewith. To evidence the C-
PACE Lien, Property Owner requests that the [County/City/Town] execute a C-PACE
Lien Certificate that will be recorded in the Land Records of the [County/
City], which C-PACE Lien Certificate shall state that it secures both the Loan
Amount and also all interest, delinquent interest, late fees, other types of
fees, penalties, Program Fees and collection costs (including attorneys' fees
and costs) payable in connection therewith, and a copy of the Assessment
Payment Schedule shall be attached thereto as an exhibit.
   (d)   C-PACE Payments. The C-PACE Loan is due and payable to the Capital
Provider [or the [County/City/Town] for the benefit of the Capital Provider] as
set forth in the Assessment Payment Schedule and remitted as follows:
____________________________________ _ ____________________________________
____________________________________ ______
____________________________________ ____________________________________
____________________________________ ____________________________________
____________________________________ ____________________________________
_________________. Once the C-PACE Loan, including all accrued interest (both
current and delinquent), late fees, other types of fees, penalties, collection
costs and Program Fees, has been satisfied and paid in full, Capital Provider
and the [City/County/Town], acting at the request and direction of Capital
Provider (which shall certify such payment in full to the [City/County/Town]),
shall execute a joint release of the C-PACE Lien Certificate, and the Capital
Provider shall record the release in the Land Records and deliver a copy of the
recorded release to Property Owner and the [City/County/Town].
   (e)   Remittance of C-PACE Payments to Capital Provider: The C-PACE Loan
shall be serviced by the Capital Provider, and Property Owner's C-PACE Payments
shall be paid directly to its Capital Provider. The foregoing notwithstanding,
if for any reason Property Owner's C-PACE Payments are payable to the Program
Administrator or the [County/City/Town] or its Treasurer, then the party
receiving such C-PACE Payments shall remit all such payments to the Capital
Provider within thirty (30) days of receipt, subject, if applicable, to the
deduction and remittance of the Program Fees to the Program Administrator as
set forth in Section 3(b), above, the C-PACE Documents and the Program
Guidelines.
   (f)   Maintenance of Assessment. The [County/City/Town] agrees to maintain
and continue the C-PACE Lien on the Property for the benefit of Capital
Provider until the C-PACE Loan, including all principal, interest, fees, other
types of fees, penalties, collection costs and Program Fees and other sums due,
is paid in full.
   (g)   Assignment. Capital Provider shall have the right to assign the C-PACE
Loan and C-PACE Lien to a successor Capital Provider by the execution, delivery
and recordation of a C-PACE Assignment (CP) in the Land Records, provided all
of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The C-PACE Assignment (CP) is made pursuant to the requirements of
the Ordinance and the Program Guidelines;
      (2)   The Program Administrator and Property Owner are notified in
writing of the assignment or transfer and provided the address where future C-
PACE Payments should be mailed, either at closing, if the assignment occurs
then, or at least thirty (30) days before the next Payment is due according to
the Assessment Payment Schedule; and
      (3)   The assignee or transferee, by operation of the C-PACE Assignment
(CP) or otherwise, assumes Capital Provider's obligations under the C-PACE
Documents.
      (4)   If for any reason C-PACE Payments are being paid to the [County/
City/Town] or its Treasurer, neither of them shall be obligated to remit C-PACE
Payments to a new Capital Provider to which the C-PACE Loan is being assigned
until a recorded copy of the C-PACE Assignment (CP) has been provided to the
[County/City/Town] and its Treasurer at the following address[es]:
      [County/City/Town]:
         ____________________________
         ____________________________
         ____________________________
      Treasurer:
         ____________________________
         ____________________________
         ____________________________
Upon written notice to the Program Administrator and Property Owner of an
assignment or transfer of the right to receive the C-PACE Payments that meets
all of these conditions, the assignor shall be released of all of the
obligations of the Capital Provider under the C-PACE Documents accruing after
the date of the assignment. Any attempt to assign or transfer the C-PACE Loan
or C-PACE Lien that does not meet all of these conditions is void.
   (h)   Lien Priority and Enforcement. Pursuant to the C-PACE Act, the
Ordinance and the Program Guidelines:
      (1)   Delinquent Payments on the C-PACE Loan will incur interest and
penalties as set forth in the C-PACE Documents.
      (2)   The C-PACE Lien, together with any penalties and interest thereon:
         (i)   has the same priority status as a lien for [County/City/Town]
real estate taxes;
         (ii)   has superior lien status to all subordinated liens against the
Property from the date on which the C-PACE Lien Certificate is filed in the
Land Records until the financing secured by the C-PACE Lien and any penalties
and interest are paid in full;
         (iii)   shall run with the land, and notwithstanding Va. Code Sec.
58.1-3967, any portion of the C-PACE Lien that has not yet become due under the
C-PACE Documents is not eliminated by the foreclosure of: (i) a [County/City/
Town] property tax lien, or (ii) the lien for any past due portion of the C-
PACE Loan.
         (iv)   In the event of a sale or transfer of the Property by Property
Owner, the obligation for the C-PACE Lien and Property Owner's obligations
under the C-PACE Documents will be assumed by and transferred to the succeeding
owner.
      (3)   In the event of Property Owner's default under the terms of the C-
PACE Documents, the [City/County/Town], acting by and through the Treasurer,
may enforce the C-PACE Lien for the amount of the Delinquent Payments, late
fees, penalties, interest, and any costs of collection in the same manner that
a property tax lien against real property may be enforced under Title 58.1,
Chapter 39, Article 4 of the Virginia Code. [For Cities only: Va. Code Sec.
58.1-3965.1 shall be applied to the sale of any Property to enforce a C-PACE
Lien to collect Delinquent Payments.] Capital Provider agrees to cooperate with
the [County/City/Town] and its Treasurer in its enforcement of the C-PACE Lien
by providing all necessary documents and information concerning the delinquent
C-PACE Loan as requested by the [County/City/Town] Attorney's Office. If the
[County/City/Town], acting through its Treasurer, determines not to enforce the
C-PACE Lien itself, which determination shall be made within thirty (30) days
of receipt by the [City/County/Town] from the Capital Provider of notice of the
Property Owner's default under the terms of the C-PACE Documents, then the
[City/County/Town], acting by and through the Treasurer, shall, within fifteen
(15) days of the [County/City/Town]'s determination not to enforce the C-PACE
lien, assign the right to enforce the C-PACE Lien in accordance with the terms
of the C-PACE Documents to the Capital Provider by executing a C-PACE
Assignment (Locality) and deliver such instrument to the Capital Provider for
recordation in the Land Records. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, a C-
PACE Assignment (Locality) may be executed and recorded at any time during the
term of the C-PACE Loan, including at the C-PACE Loan's closing, regardless of
whether the C-PACE Loan is then in default. Upon such assignment and
recordation, the Capital Provider is authorized to, and shall, enforce the C-
PACE Lien according to the terms of the C-PACE Documents, in the same manner
that a property tax lien against real property may be enforced under Title
58.1, Chapter 39 of the Virginia Code, including the institution of suit in the
name of the [City/County/Town] and its Treasurer, and this right to enforce
expressly includes authorization for the Capital Provider to engage legal
counsel to advise the Capital Provider and conduct all aspects of such
enforcement. Such legal counsel, being authorized to institute suit in the name
of the [City/County/Town] and its Treasurer, shall have the status of "Special
Counsel to the [City/County/Town] and its Treasurer" and an "attorney employed
by the governing body," and possess all the rights and powers of an attorney
employed under Va. Code Secs. 58.1-3966 and 58.1-3969, with the express
authority to exercise for the benefit of the Capital Provider every power
granted to a local government or its Treasurer and its or their attorneys for
the enforcement of a property tax lien under, or in connection with, any
provision contained in Title 58.1, Chapter 39, Article 4 of the Virginia Code.
The [City/County/Town], on its behalf and on behalf of the Treasurer, waives
its right to require such legal counsel to post the optional bond described in
Va. Code Sec. 58.1-3966. All collection and enforcement costs and expenses
(including legal fees and costs), interest, late fees, other types of fees, and
penalties charged by the [City/County/Town] or Capital Provider, as applicable
and consistent with the C-PACE Act and the Virginia Code, shall (i) be added to
the Delinquent Payments being collected, (ii) become part of the aggregate
amount sued for and collected, (iii) be added to the C-PACE Loan, and (iv) be
secured by the C-PACE Lien. Nothing herein shall prevent the Capital Provider
to which the C-PACE Lien has been assigned from enforcing the C-PACE Lien to
the fullest extent permitted by the C-PACE Documents, the C-PACE Act or general
law. The Property Owner of a Property being sold to pay Delinquent Payments, or
other interested party, may redeem the Property at any time prior to the
Property's sale, in accordance with Va. Code Secs. 58.1-3974 and 58.1-3975.
      (4)   In a bill in equity for sale of a Property to collect Delinquent
Payments, the [County/City/Town] will be entitled to recover the Delinquent
Payments, late fees, other types of fees, penalties, Program Fees, interest
due, and the costs and expenses of collection, including attorney's fees and
costs, all as set forth in the C-PACE Documents.
   (i)   Property Owner's Waiver of Certain Defenses; Confession of Judgment:
By executing this Agreement, Property Owner acknowledges and agrees as follows:
      (1)   After the C-PACE Lien Certificate is recorded, Property Owner
waives the right to contest the Lien on the basis that the improvements funded
with the C-PACE Loan are not Eligible Improvements;
      (2)   Property Owner waives all defenses, affirmative or otherwise, to
any enforcement or collection action brought as a result of Property Owner's
default in the payment of the C-PACE Payments due pursuant to the C-PACE
Documents;
      (3)   To the extent permitted by the Financing Agreement, Property Owner
waives all defenses to the imposition of personal liability for corporate
officers as permitted under Section 58.1-3965(F) of the Virginia Code;
      (4)   Property Owner shall provide a confession of judgment if requested
by the Capital Provider.
   (j)   Written Contract Required by the C-PACE Act and Ordinance. This C-PACE
Program Agreement constitutes the written contract specifying the terms and
conditions for C-PACE Program participation as required by §15.2-958.3(A)(7) of
the C-PACE Act.
   (k)   Transfer of C-PACE Funded Improvements. Property Owner agrees that all
Improvements purchased, constructed, or installed through financing obtained
pursuant to the C-PACE Program shall be permanently affixed to the Property and
will transfer with the Property to the transferee in the event of and sale or
assignment of the Property; provided, however, that if Improvements become
obsolete or the Property Owner otherwise determines they need to be replaced
with other Improvements of equal or greater value, such Improvements may be
removed and other Improvements of equal or greater value installed.
   (l)   No Cost to [County/City/Town]. No provision of this Agreement requires
the [County/City/Town] to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder.
   (m)   Term of the Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall commence upon
the Effective Date and shall be in full force and effect until the C-PACE Loan
has been irrevocably paid in full.
   Section 4 - Indemnification.
   Without limiting any other obligation or liability of the Property Owner, or
any right or remedy of the Capital Provider or the [County/City/Town], Property
Owner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Capital Provider and the
[County/City/Town], their [councilmembers][supervisors], directors, officers,
employees, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates (each, an "Indemnified Party"),
from and against all damages, losses, settlement payments, obligations,
liabilities, claims, suits, penalties, assessments, citations, directives,
demands, judgments, actions or causes of action, whether created by statute or
common law, including all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees,
arising from or associated with this C-PACE Loan transaction. This section
shall survive the expiration of the Term of this Agreement.
   Section 5 - Miscellaneous Provisions.
   (a)   Construction. This Agreement is to be construed in accordance with and
with reference to the C-PACE Act, the Ordinance, the Locality Agreement and the
Program Guidelines.
   (b)   Further Assurances. Property Owner further covenants and agrees to do,
execute and deliver, or cause to be done, executed and delivered all such
further acts for implementing the intention of this Agreement as may be
reasonably necessary or required.
   (c)   Severability. If the C-PACE Act, the Ordinance, the Locality Agreement
or any clause, provision, or section of this Agreement, is challenged and held
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by the [County/City/
Town] or Capital Provider, Property Owner agrees to continue to make the C-PACE
Payments required under the C-PACE Documents and agrees to execute any and all
documentation to perfect and enforce the C-PACE Loan as required by the
[County/City/Town] or Capital Provider. The invalidity of any clause,
provision, or section of this Agreement shall not affect any remaining clauses,
provisions, or sections of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be construed
and enforced as if the illegal or invalid clause, provision, or section had not
been included herein.
   (d)   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which
together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Electronically
transmitted and digitally signed signatures shall have the same force and
effect as, and shall be treated as, a "wet ink" original signature.
   (e)   Notices. All notices, requests, consents and other communications
(collectively, "Notices") shall be in writing and shall be delivered, mailed by

or agent of another, or retail business to advertise or conduct a sale for the
purpose of discontinuing a retail business located in Loudoun County, or to
modify the word “sale” in any advertisement with the words "going out of
business" or any other words which tend to insinuate that the retail business
is to be discontinued and the goods, wares or merchandise liquidated, unless

such inventory. If there are other goods, wares or merchandise located on the

840.01   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Affiliated group” means:
      (1)   One or more chains of corporations subject to inclusion, connected
through stock ownership with a common parent corporation, which is a
corporation subject to inclusion if:
         A.   Stock possessing at least eighty percent of the voting power of
all classes of stock and at least eighty percent of each class of the nonvoting
stock of each of the corporations subject to inclusion, except the common
parent corporation, is owned directly by one or more of the other corporations
subject to inclusion; and
         B.   The common parent corporation directly owns stock possessing at
least eighty percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least
eighty percent of each class of the nonvoting stock of at least one of the
other corporations subject to inclusion.
            As used in this subsection, the term “stock” does not include
nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends; the phrase
“corporation subject to inclusion” means any corporation within the affiliated
group, irrespective of the state or country of its incorporation; and the term
“receipts” includes gross receipts and gross income.
      (2)   Two or more corporations if five or fewer persons who are
individuals, estates or trusts own stock possessing:
         A.   At least eighty percent of the total combined voting power of all

of shares of all classes of the stock of each corporation; and
         B.   More than fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock entitled to vote or more than fifty percent of the total value
of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the
stock ownership of each such person only to the extent that such stock
ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.
            When one or more of the corporations subject to inclusion,

“stock,” as used in this paragraph, shall refer to the nonstock corporation
membership or membership voting rights, as is appropriate to the context.
   (b)   “Assessment” means a determination as to the proper rate of tax, the
measure to which the tax rate is applied and, ultimately, the amount of tax,
including additional or omitted tax, that is due. An assessment shall include a
written assessment made pursuant to notice by the Commissioner of the Revenue
or a self-assessment made by a taxpayer upon the filing of a return or
otherwise not pursuant to notice. Assessments shall be deemed made by the
Commissioner of the Revenue when a written notice of assessment is delivered to
the taxpayer by the Commissioner of the Revenue or an employee of the
Commissioner of the Revenue or mailed to the taxpayer at their last known
address. Self-assessments shall be deemed made when a return is filed, or if no
return is required, when the tax is paid. A return filed or tax paid before the

deemed to be filed or paid on the last day specified for the filing of a return
or the payment of the tax, as the case may be.
   (c)   “Appealable event” means an increase in the assessment of a license
tax payable by a taxpayer, the denial of a license tax refund, or the

determining the correctness of an assessment; (ii) determination regarding the
rate or classification applicable to the licensable business; (iii) assessment
of a local license tax when no return was filed by the taxpayer; or (iv) denial
of an application for correction of erroneous assessment attendant to the
filing of an amended application for license.
      An appealable event also includes a determination by the Commissioner of
the Revenue of a classification or subclassification applicable to the
business, regardless of whether the determination is in conjunction with an
assessment, examination, audit, or any other action taken by the Commissioner
of the Revenue.

owned by others. Contractors shall also include any persons who subdivide and

satisfied any requirements imposed by State law or other provisions of the
Loudoun County Codified Ordinances;
      (2)   All of the businesses or professions are subject to the same tax
rate or, if subject to different tax rates, the licensee agrees to be taxed on
all businesses and professions at the highest applicable rate; and
      (3)   The taxpayer supplies such information as the Commissioner of the
Revenue may require concerning the nature of the businesses and their gross
receipts.
   (c)   Application for License. Every person, when engaging in a business or
profession in the County shall make application for licenses to the
Commissioner of the Revenue in accordance with this chapter. The business shall
submit the necessary filing and other requirements, as the Commissioner may
require. The Commissioner shall compute the amount of license tax and, after
payment has been received by the County Treasurer, the business license shall
be issued; provided, however, that a business license may not be issued until
the applicant has produced satisfactory evidence that all delinquent business
license, real estate, personal property, meals, transient occupancy, severance
and admission taxes owed by the business to the County have been paid.
Applications for renewal of the business license shall be done by reporting
annual receipts to the Commissioner annually.
   (d)   Required Information; Failure to Provide Information. Every applicant
for a license to conduct any business, profession, trade or occupation under
the provisions of this chapter shall furnish the Commissioner of the Revenue,
with the correct name and trade name, if any, of the applicant, the correct
physical address of the business applicant, the mailing address of the
business, the nature of the business, profession, trade or occupation to be
pursued, the place where it is to be pursued, and a record of gross receipts
and documentation supporting any exclusions or deductions for the year,
verified by oath, as well as such information as may be required by law.
Allowable exclusions and deductions are included under section
840.11  of this chapter as authorized in section 58.1-3732 et seq. of the Code
of Virginia, as amended, or Title 23 Agency 10 Chapter 500 of the
Administrative Code of Virginia. In the event of a failure or refusal to file
with the Commissioner of the Revenue the information necessary to enable the
Commissioner to assess the correct amount of license tax as provided by law,
the Commissioner of the Revenue shall assess such license tax upon the best
information obtainable, adding thereto the penalty prescribed by law.
   (e)   License for Persons Beginning Business, Etc. Every person beginning a
business, profession, trade or occupation which is subject to license tax under
the provisions of this chapter shall estimate and report to the Commissioner
the amount of the gross receipts the business will receive between the date of
beginning such business and the end of the then current calendar year.
   (f)   Licensing Basis. As to businesses, professions, trades or occupations
for which a gross receipts license tax is levied on persons having a definite
place of business in the County, all gross receipts derived from the business,
profession, trade or occupation shall be included in their licensing basis,
provided that in cases where their business, profession, trade or occupation
requires the performance of certain activities outside of the County and they
would be liable for a similar tax in the other taxing jurisdiction based on
gross receipts derived from activities conducted within the other taxing
jurisdiction, they shall be permitted to deduct such gross receipts taxed or
taxable by the other taxing jurisdiction in arriving at their licensing basis.
In all cases, such amounts attributable to a definite place of business in any
other locality must be disclosed when filing their gross receipts to the
County.

12-11; Ord. 14-11. Passed 12-10-14; Ord. 22-16. Passed 10-12-22.)
840.035   LICENSING FOR SPECIAL EVENTS.
   A Special Event Organizer shall:
   (a)   File with the Commissioner of the Revenue at least fourteen days prior
to the proposed start of each Special Event a list of all Special Event
Itinerant Vendors to whom a space, booth or other area has been leased or
assigned for the purpose of operating a temporary business or sales activity
during the Special Event.
   (b)   Advise each Special Event Itinerant Vendor of their responsibility for
collecting Virginia sales and use taxes on all transactions, and that sales tax
forms may be obtained from the Commissioner of the Revenue's Office.
(Ord. 04-13. Passed 10-12-04.)
840.04   PAYMENT OF TAX; PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO FILE AND PAY WHEN DUE.
   (a)   Due Dates. Each person subject to a license fee or tax shall apply for
a business license no later than thirty days after commencing operations in the
County if the business was not subject to licensure in the County on or before
January 1 of the license year and should pay the license fee on the same date.
   For persons with a business license from previous year(s) or who were
subject to tax in preceding year(s), the license declarations and taxes or
fees, as appropriate, shall become due and payable on or before March 1 of each
license year. The declaration shall be on the forms and in the manner
prescribed by the Commissioner of the Revenue.
   (b)   Payment of License Tax by Corporations, Etc. When the business,
profession, trade or occupation licensed is conducted by a corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or limited liability partnership and the
license tax is imposed upon the gross receipts thereof, the license tax shall
be imposed upon the gross receipts of the corporation, partnership, limited
liability company or limited liability partnership and paid by it. When so
paid, and also when paid by an individual employing persons who would otherwise
be liable for a license tax, payment of the license tax shall be deemed to
discharge the license tax liability of the officers and employees of such
corporation and partners, and employees of such limited liability company, and
employees of such limited liability partnership, and employees of such
partnership, and employees of such persons employed by an employer who would
otherwise be liable to such license tax, insofar as the business of such
licensed corporation, partnership, limited liability company, limited liability
partnership or employer is concerned.
   (c)   Penalty for Failure to File and Pay When Due. A penalty of ten percent
of the tax may be imposed upon the failure to file an application which shall
include declared gross receipts, or the failure to pay the tax by the
appropriate due date. Only the late filing penalty shall be imposed by the
Commissioner of the Revenue if both the application and payment are late.
However, both penalties may be assessed if the Commissioner of the Revenue
determines that the taxpayer has a history of noncompliance. In the case of
assessment of additional tax made by the Commissioner, if the application and,
if applicable, the return was made in good faith and the understatement of the
tax was not due to fraud or reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the
taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the additional
tax. If any assessment of the tax by the Commissioner is not paid within thirty
days, the Treasurer or other collecting official may impose a ten percent late
payment penalty. If the failure to file or pay was not the fault of the
taxpayer, the penalties shall not be imposed or, if imposed, shall be abated by
the official who assessed them. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the
taxpayer must show they acted responsibly and the failure was due to events
beyond their control.
   As used in this subsection:
      (1)   “Acted responsibly” means that:
         A.   The taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a
prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the filing
and payment obligations of the business; and
         B.   The taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the
failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where applicable),
attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment once it occurred and promptly
rectifying a failure once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered.
      (2)   “Events beyond a taxpayer's control” include, but are not limited
to, the unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; the
unavoidable absence (e.g. due to death or serious illness) of the person with
the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's reliance in good
faith upon erroneous written information from the Commissioner who was aware of
the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when the taxpayer
provided the erroneous information.
   (d)   Interest. Interest at the rate of 10 percent per year shall be charged
on the late payment of the tax computed monthly from the first day following
the date such payment is due until the date paid without regard to fault or
other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or
omitted tax by the Commissioner is found to be erroneous, whether attributable
to an amended return or other reason, the tax, penalty and all interest charged
and collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous, shall be
refunded, together with interest on the refund computed as provided in section
864.02(d), except as otherwise provided herein.
   No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability at the
conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund issued within
thirty days from the date of the payment that created the refund.

8-04; Ord. 11-18. Passed 12-12-11; Ord. 22-16. Passed 10-12-22.)
840.05   SITUS OF GROSS RECEIPTS.
   (a)   General Rule. Whenever the tax imposed by this chapter is measured by
gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be
only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a privilege, subject to
licensure at a definite place of business within this jurisdiction, for the
preceding calendar year. In the case of activities conducted outside of a
definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the
gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which
such activities are initiated, directed or controlled. The situs of gross
receipts for different classifications shall be attributed to one or more
definite places of business or offices as follows:
      (1)   The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the
definite place of business at which services are performed, or, if the services
are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of
business from which the services are directed or controlled, unless the
contractor is subject to the provisions of section 58.1-3715 of the Code of
Virginia, as amended.
      (2)   The gross receipts of any contractor who conducts business in the
County for less than thirty days without a definite place of business in the
Commonwealth of Virginia, where the amount of business done by such person in
the County exceeds or will exceed the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000) for the license year, shall be attributable to the place within the
County where the contractor's services are performed.
      (3)   The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed
to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur,
or, if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of
business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation
activities are directed or controlled. However, a wholesaler or distribution
house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs
of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which
deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers.
Any wholesaler who is subject to a license tax in two or more localities and
who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different
measurers, may apply to the Department of Taxation for a determination as to
the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in
each locality.
      (4)   The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property
shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible
personal property is rented, or, if the property is not rented from any
definite place of business, then to the definite place of business at which the
rental of such property is managed; and
      (5)   The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be
attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are
performed, or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then to the
definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled.
   (b)   Apportionment. If the licensee has more than one definite place of
business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite
place of business gross receipts are to be attributed, gross receipts of the
business shall be apportioned between the definite places of business on the
basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place
of business, unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred
at, or were controlled from, such definite place of business. Gross receipts
attributable to a definite place of business in another jurisdiction shall not
be attributed to this jurisdiction solely because the other jurisdiction does
not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of
business in such other jurisdiction.
   (c)   Apportionment Agreements. The Commissioner of the Revenue may enter
into agreements with any other political subdivision of Virginia concerning the
manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among the definite places
of business. However, the sum of gross receipts apportioned by the agreement
shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite
places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer
that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent
with the method of one or more of the political subdivisions in which the
taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is
likely to, result in taxes on more than 100 percent of its gross receipts from
all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the assessor shall make a good
faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political
subdivisions involved. If an agreement cannot be reached, either the
Commissioner or the taxpayer may seek an advisory opinion from the Department
of Taxation pursuant to Section 58.1-3701 of the Code of Virginia, as amended.
Notice of the request shall be given to the other party. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 58.1-3993 of the Code of Virginia, as amended, when a
taxpayer has demonstrated to a court that two or more political subdivisions of
Virginia have assessed taxes on gross receipts that may create a double
assessment within the meaning of section 58.1-3986 of the Code of Virginia, as
amended, the court shall enter such orders pending resolution of the litigation
as may be necessary to ensure the taxpayer is not required to pay multiple
assessments, even though it is not then known which assessment is correct and
which is erroneous.
(Ord. 96-08. Passed 10-16-96; Ord. 99-16. Passed 12-1-99; Ord. 22-16. Passed
10-12-22.)
840.06   EXTENSIONS; LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   The Commissioner of the Revenue may grant an extension of time in
which to file for a license, for reasonable cause. The extension may be
conditioned upon timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate
tax. The tax is then subject to adjustment to the correct tax at the end of the
extension, together with interest, from the due date until the date paid and,
if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under
the circumstances, with a penalty of ten percent of the portion paid after the
due date.
    (b)   Whenever, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the
assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this chapter, both the
Commissioner of the Revenue and the taxpayer have consented, in writing, to its
assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the
expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended
by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period
previously agreed upon.
   (c)   Notwithstanding section 58.1-3903 of the Code of Virginia, as amended,
which pertains to omitted local taxes and levies, the Commissioner of the
Revenue shall assess the local license tax omitted because of fraud or failure
to apply for a license for the current license year and the six preceding
license years.
   (d)   The period for collecting any local license tax shall not expire prior
to the period specified in section 58.1-3940 of the Code of Virginia, as
amended, two years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment
has been extended pursuant to this subsection, two years after the final
determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to
section
840.07 or two years after final determination in a court application pursuant
to section 58.1-3984 of the Code of Virginia and section
840.08, as amended, or a similar law for which collection has been stayed,
whichever is later.
(Ord. 96-08. Passed 10-16-96; Ord. 22-16. Passed 10-12-22.)
840.07   ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS OF LOCAL LICENSE TAX.
   Section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia establishes an administrative
review process designed to encourage resolution of local license tax issues
through an appeals process that includes review by the Commissioner of the
Revenue and appeal to the Tax Commissioner:
   (a)   Administrative Appeal to the Commissioner of the Revenue:
      (1)   Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of an
appealable event as defined in section 58.1-3701.3 of the Code of Virginia and
section 840.01 of this chapter, may file an administrative appeal of such
assessment or classification applicable to the taxpayer’s business with the
Commissioner of the Revenue within one year from the last day of the tax year
for which such assessment is made, or within one year from the date of the
appealable event, whichever is later. The appeal must be filed in good faith
and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, the tax periods covered by the
challenged assessments, the amount in dispute, the remedy sought, each alleged
error in the assessment or classification, the grounds upon which the taxpayer
relies, and any other fact relevant to the taxpayer’s contention. The
Commissioner of the Revenue may hold a conference with the taxpayer, if
requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and
documents, and audit or further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a
proper and equitable determination of the appeal. The Commissioner of the
Revenue shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer’s claims and issue a
final written determination to the taxpayer setting forth the facts and
arguments in support of the Commissioner of the Revenue’s final written
determination. The decision of the Commissioner of the Revenue shall include a
written explanation of the taxpayer's right to file an administrative appeal to
the Tax Commissioner, the name and address to which the appeal should be
directed, and the deadline for filing such appeal.
            If the taxpayer disagrees with the final written determination of
the Commissioner of the Revenue, the taxpayer may file an Administrative Appeal
to the Tax Commissioner in accordance with section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of
Virginia and subsection (b) hereof.
      (2)   Provided a timely and complete administrative appeal is filed with
the Commissioner of the Revenue, collection activity with respect to the amount
in dispute shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the
Commissioner, unless the Treasurer (i) determines that collection would be
jeopardized by delay, as defined in section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of
Virginia, as amended; (ii) is advised by the Commissioner of the Revenue that
the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a
reasonable time, or (iii) is advised by the Commissioner of the Revenue that
the appeal is frivolous as defined in section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of
Virginia as amended. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of
section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia, as amended, but no further penalty
shall be imposed while collection action is suspended.
      (3)   Any taxpayer whose administrative appeal to the Commissioner of the
Revenue pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) has been pending for more
than one year without the issuance of a final determination by the Commissioner
may, upon not less than 30 days' written notice to the Commissioner of the
Revenue, elect to treat the appeal as denied and appeal the assessment to the
Tax Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b). The Tax
Commissioner shall not consider an appeal filed pursuant to the provisions of
subsection (a) if he finds that the absence of a final written determination on
the part of the Commissioner of the Revenue was caused by the willful failure
or refusal of the taxpayer to provide information requested and reasonably
needed by the Commissioner to make his determination.
      (4)   The appeal of the classification of a business shall not affect or
change any limitations period prescribed by law for appealing an assessment.
The administrative appeal of the classification of the business to the
Commissioner of the Revenue pursuant to section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of
Virginia and subsection (a) hereof shall not apply to any license year for
which the Tax Commissioner had previously issued a determination pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof below relating to any license fee or license tax imposed
upon the taxpayer’s business for that same year.
   (b)   Administrative Appeal to the Virginia Tax Commissioner:
      (1)   Any taxpayer assessed with a local license tax, or who has received
a determination with regard to the classification applicable to the taxpayer’s
business, as a result of a final written determination from the Commissioner of
the Revenue upon an administrative appeal to the Commissioner in accordance
with section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and subsection (a) hereof
above, may appeal the final written determination of the Commissioner to the
Tax Commissioner. The appeal to the Tax Commissioner must be fined within 90
days of the date of the final written determination of the administrative
appeal issued by the Commission of the Revenue. The Tax Commissioner may deny
jurisdiction to consider the appeal if the taxpayer had not previously filed an
administrative appeal over the same appealable event to the Commissioner of the
Revenue in accordance with section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and
subsection (a) hereof above and has not obtained a final written determination
on such administrative appeal from the Commissioner of the Revenue.
      (2)   The appeal to the Tax Commissioner shall be in such form as the Tax
Commissioner may prescribe and the taxpayer shall serve a copy of the appeal
upon the Commissioner of the Revenue. The Tax Commissioner shall permit the
Commissioner of the Revenue to participate in the proceedings, and shall issue
a determination to the taxpayer within 90 days of receipt of the taxpayer’s
application, unless the taxpayer and the Commissioner of the Revenue are
notified that a longer period will be required. The application shall be
treated as an application pursuant to section 58.1-1821 of the Code of
Virginia, as amended, and the Tax Commissioner may issue an order correcting
such assessment or license classification of the business pursuant to section
58.1-1822 of such Code.
       (3)   Upon receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the Tax
Commissioner under section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and subsection
(b) hereof, collection activity with respect to the amount in dispute shall be
suspended until a final determination is issued by the Tax Commissioner, unless
the Treasurer (i) determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay, as
defined in section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia, as amended; (ii) is
advised by the Commissioner of the Revenue or the Tax Commissioner that the
taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a
reasonable time; or (iii) is advised by the Commissioner of the Revenue that
the appeal is frivolous as defined in section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of
Virginia and section
840.01, as amended. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of
section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia, as amended, but no further penalty
shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The requirement that
collection activity be suspended shall cease unless an appeal to the Tax
Commissioner is filed and served on the necessary parties within thirty days of
the service of notice of intent to file such appeal.
      (4)   Implementation of determination of Tax Commissioner. Promptly upon
receipt of the final determination of the Tax Commissioner with respect to an
appeal pursuant to this subsection (b), the Commissioner of the Revenue shall
take those steps necessary to calculate the amount of tax owed by or refund due
to the taxpayer consistent with the Tax Commissioner's determination and shall
provide that information to the taxpayer and to the Treasurer in accordance
with the provisions of this subsection (b).
         A.   If the determination of the Tax Commissioner sets forth a
specific amount of tax due, the Commissioner of the Revenue shall certify the
amount to the Treasurer or other official responsible for collection, and the
Treasurer shall issue a bill to the taxpayer for such amount due, together with
interest accrued and penalty, if any is authorized by section 58.1- 3703.1 of
the Code of Virginia, within 30 days of the date of the determination of the
Tax Commissioner.
         B.   If the determination of the Tax Commissioner sets forth a
specific amount of refund due, the Commissioner of the Revenue shall certify
the amount to the Treasurer or other official responsible for collection, and
the Treasurer shall issue a payment to the taxpayer for such amount due,
together with interest accrued pursuant to section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of
Virginia, within 30 days of the date of the determination of the Tax
Commissioner.
         C.   If the determination of the Tax Commissioner does not set forth a
specific amount of tax due, or otherwise requires the Commissioner of the
Revenue to undertake a new or revised assessment that will result in an
obligation to pay a tax that has not previously been paid in full, the
Commissioner of the Revenue shall promptly commence the steps necessary to
undertake such new or revised assessment, and provide the same to the taxpayer
within 60 days of the date of the determination of the Tax Commissioner, or
within 60 days after receipt from the taxpayer of any additional information
requested or reasonably required under the determination of the Tax
Commissioner, whichever is later. The Commissioner of the Revenue shall certify
the new assessment to the Treasurer or other official responsible for
collection, and the Treasurer shall issue a bill to the taxpayer for the amount
due, together with interest accrued and penalty, if any is authorized by
section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia, within 30 days of the date of the
new assessment.
         D.   If the determination of the Tax Commissioner does not set forth a
specific amount of refund due, or otherwise requires the Commissioner of the
Revenue to undertake a new or revised assessment that will result in an
obligation on the part of the locality to make a refund of taxes previously
paid, the Commissioner of the Revenue shall promptly commence the steps
necessary to undertake such new or revised assessment or to determine the
amount of refund due in the case of a correction to the license classification
of the business, and provide the same to the taxpayer within 60 days of the
date of the determination of the Tax Commissioner, or within 60 days after
receipt from the taxpayer of any additional information requested or reasonably
required under the determination of the Tax Commissioner, whichever is later.
The Commissioner of the Revenue shall certify the new assessment to the
Treasurer or other official responsible for collection, and the Treasurer shall
issue a refund to the taxpayer for the amount of tax due, together with
interest accrued, within 30 days of the date of the new assessment.
   (c)   The existence or utilization by a taxpayer of the administrative
review process provided in section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and this
section 840.07 does not affect the taxpayer’s right to pursue other
administrative remedies authorized by law.
(Ord. 96-08. Passed 10-16-96; Ord. 11-18. Passed 12-12-11; Ord. 22-16. Passed
10-12-22.)
840.075   JUDICIAL REVIEW OF DETERMINATION OF TAX COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   Following the issuance of a final determination of the Tax
Commissioner pursuant to section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and
section
840.07(b), the taxpayer or Commissioner of the Revenue may apply to the
appropriate circuit court for judicial review of the determination, or any part
thereof, pursuant to § 58.1-3984 of the Code of Virginia, as amended. In any
such proceeding for judicial review of a determination of the Tax Commissioner,
the burden shall be on the party challenging the determination of the Tax
Commissioner, or any part thereof, to show that the ruling of the Tax
Commissioner is erroneous with respect to the part challenged. Neither the Tax
Commissioner nor the Department of Taxation shall be made a party to an
application to correct an assessment merely because the Tax Commissioner has
ruled on it.
   (b)   Suspension of payment of disputed amount of tax due upon taxpayer's
notice of intent to initiate judicial review.
      (1)   On receipt of a notice of intent to file an application for
judicial review, pursuant to Section 58.1-3984 of the Code of Virginia, as
amended, of a determination of the Tax Commissioner pursuant to section 58.1-
3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and section
840.07(b), and upon payment of the amount of the tax that is not in dispute
together with any penalty and interest then due with respect to such undisputed
portion of the tax, the Treasurer or other collection official shall further
suspend collection activity while the court retains jurisdiction unless the
court, upon appropriate motion after notice and an opportunity to be heard,
determines that (i) the taxpayer's application for judicial review is
frivolous, as defined in section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and
subsection
840.01; (ii) collection would be jeopardized by delay, as defined in the same
section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and subsection
840.01 of this Chapter 840 or (iii) suspension of collection would cause
substantial economic hardship to the County as described in section 58.1-3703.1
of the Code of Virginia. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the
provisions of section 58.1-3703.1 of the Code of Virginia, but no further
penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended.
      (2)   Upon a determination that the appeal is frivolous, that collection
may be jeopardized by delay, or that suspension of collection would result in
substantial economic hardship to the County, the court may require the taxpayer
to pay the amount in dispute or a portion thereof, or to provide surety for
payment of the amount in dispute in a form acceptable to the court.
      (3)   No suspension of collection activity shall be required if the
application for judicial review fails to identify with particularity the amount
in dispute.
      (4)   The requirement that collection activity be suspended shall cease
unless an application for judicial review pursuant to § 58.1-3984 is filed and
served on the necessary parties within 30 days of the service of the notice of
intent to file such application.
      (5)   The suspension of collection activity authorized by this section
shall not be applicable to any appeal of a local license tax that is initiated
by the direct filing of an action pursuant to § 58.1-3984 without prior
exhaustion of the administrative appeals provided by section 58.1-3701.1 of the
Code of Virginia and section
840.07.
   (c)   Suspension of payment of disputed amount of refund due upon County’s
notice of intent to initiate judicial review.
      (1)   Payment of any refund determined to be due pursuant to the
determination of the Tax Commissioner of an appeal pursuant to section 58.1-
3703.1 of the Code of Virginia and subsection
840.07(b) shall be suspended if the County assessing the tax serves upon the
taxpayer, within 60 days of the date of the determination of the Tax

license tax to a specific situation from the Commissioner of the Revenue. In
addition, the taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the
classification applicable to the taxpayer’s business, including whether the
business properly falls within a business license subclassification established
by the County. Any taxpayer requesting such a ruling must provide all facts
relevant to the situation placed at issue and may present a rationale for the
basis for an interpretation of the law most favorable to the taxpayer. Any
misrepresentation or change in the applicable law or the factual situation as
presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A
written ruling may be revoked or amended prospectively if there is a change in
the Code of Virginia, a court decision or the Virginia Administrative Code upon
which the ruling was based, or if the Commissioner notifies the taxpayer of a
change in the policy or interpretation of the law upon which the ruling was
based. However, any person who acts on a written ruling which later becomes
invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which
such ruling was in effect.

Commissioner to ascertain what is the correct amount of the tax that was
assessable for each of those years. All such records, books of accounts and
other information shall be open for inspection and examination by the
Commissioner in order to allow the Commissioner to establish whether a
particular receipt is directly attributable to the licensed privilege exercised
within the County. The Commissioner shall provide the taxpayer with the option
to conduct the audit in the taxpayer's local business office if the records are
maintained there. In the event the records are maintained outside the County,
copies of the appropriate books and records shall be sent to the Commissioner’s
office on demand.
(Ord. 11-18. Passed 12-12-11; Ord. 22-16. Passed 10-12-22.)

corporation, for any fraction of a year during which such person, firm or
corporation has permanently ceased to engage in such business, profession,
trade, occupation or calling within the County. In the event a person, firm or
corporation ceases to engage in a business, profession, trade, occupation or
calling within the County during a year for which a license tax based on gross
receipts has already been paid, the taxpayer shall be entitled, upon
application, to a refund for that portion of the license tax already paid,
prorated on a monthly basis so as to ensure that the licensed privilege is
taxed only for that fraction of the year during which it is exercised within
the County. The County may elect to remit any refunds in the ensuing fiscal
year and may offset against such refund any amount of past-due taxes owed by
the same taxpayer. In no event shall the County be required to refund any part
of a flat fee or minimum flat tax.

848.01   SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION OF REAL ESTATE FOR ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   The County finds that the preservation of real estate devoted to
agricultural, horticultural, forest and open space uses within its boundaries
is in the public interest and, having heretofore adopted a land use plan,
hereby declares that such real estate shall be taxed in accordance with the
provisions of Article 4 of Chapter 32 of Title 58.1 of the Code of Virginia of
1950, as amended, and of this chapter.
   (b)   For the purposes of this chapter for following special classifications

      (1)   "Real estate devoted to agricultural use" shall mean real estate
devoted to the bona fide production for sale of plants and animals, or products

agreement with an agency of the state or federal government under uniform
standards prescribed by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services
in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). Prior,
discontinued use of property shall not be considered in determining its current
use. Real estate upon which recreational activities are conducted for a profit
or otherwise shall be considered real estate devoted to agricultural use as
long as the recreational activities conducted on such real estate do not change
the character of the real estate so that, it does not meet the uniform
standards prescribed by the Commissioner of Agricultural and Consumer Services.
Real property that has been designated as devoted to agricultural use shall not
lose such designation solely because a portion of the property is being used
for a different purpose pursuant to a special use permit or otherwise allowed
by zoning, provided that the property, excluding such portion, otherwise meets
all the requirements for such designation. The portion of the properly being
used for a different purpose pursuant to a special use permit or otherwise
allowed by zoning shall be deemed a separate piece of property from the
remaining property for purposes of assessment.
      (2)   "Real estate devoted to horticultural use" shall mean real estate

a soil and water conservation program under an agreement with an agency of the
state or federal government under uniform standards prescribed by the
Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services in accordance with the
Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). Prior, discontinued use of
property shall not be considered in determining its current use. Real estate
upon which recreational activities are conducted for profit or otherwise shall
be considered real estate devoted to horticultural use as long as the
recreational activities conducted on such real estate do not change the
character of the real estate so that it does not meet the uniform standards
prescribed by the Commissioner of Agricultural and Consumer Services. Real
property that has been designated as devoted to horticultural use shall not
lose such designation solely because a portion of the property is being used
for a different purpose pursuant to a special use permit or otherwise allowed
by zoning, provided that the property, excluding such portion, otherwise meets
all the requirements for such designation. The portion of the property being
used for a different purpose pursuant to a special use permit or otherwise
allowed by zoning shall be deemed a separate piece of property from the
remaining property for purposes of assessment.
      (3)   "Real estate devoted to forest use" shall mean land, including the
standing timber and trees thereon, devoted to tree growth in such quantity and
so spaced and maintained as to constitute a forest area under standards
prescribed by the State forester pursuant to the authority set out in § 58.1-
3240 and in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et
seq.). Prior, discontinued use of property shall not be considered in
determining its current use. Real estate upon which recreational activities are
conducted for profit, or otherwise, shall still be considered real estate
devoted to forest use as long as the recreational activities conducted on such
real estate do not change the character of the real estate so that it no longer
constitutes a forest area under standards prescribed by the State Forester
pursuant to the authority set out in § 58.1-3240. Real property that has been
designated as devoted to forest use shall not lose such designation solely
because a portion of the property is being used for a different purpose
pursuant to a special use permit or is otherwise allowed by zoning, provided
that the property, excluding such portion, otherwise meets all the requirements
for such designation. The portion of the property being used for a different
purpose pursuant to a special use permit or otherwise allowed by zoning shall
be deemed a separate piece of property from the remaining property for purposes
of assessment.
      (4)   "Real estate devoted to open-space use" shall mean real estate used
as, or preserved for, (i) park or recreational purposes, including public or
private golf courses, (ii) conservation of land or other natural resources,
(iii) floodways, (iv) wetlands as defined in § 58.1-3666, (v) riparian buffers
as defined in § 58.1-3666, (vi) historic or scenic purposes, or (vii) assisting
in the shaping of the character, direction, and timing of community development
or for the public interest and consistent with the local land-use plan under
uniform standards prescribed by the Director of the Department of Conservation
and Recreation pursuant to the authority set out in § 58.1-3240 and in
accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) and the
local Ordinance. Prior, discontinued use of property shall not be considered in
determining its current use. Real property that has been designated as devoted
to open-space use shall not lose such designation solely because a portion of
the property is being used for a different purpose pursuant to a special use
permit or is otherwise allowed by zoning, provided that the property, excluding
such portion, otherwise meets all the requirements for such designation.
      (5)   For the purposes of each special classification the portion of the
property being used for a different purpose pursuant to a special use permit or
otherwise allowed by zoning shall be deemed a separate piece of property from
the remaining property for purposes of assessment. The presence of utility
lines on real property shall not be considered in determining whether the
property, including thy portion where the utility lines are located, is devoted
to agricultural use, horticultural use, forest use or open-space use. In
determining whether real property is devoted to agricultural use, horticultural
use, forest use or open-space use, zoning designations and special use for the
property shall not be the sole considerations.

   (a)   The minimum acreage requirements for special classifications of real
estate shall be determined by adding together the total area of contiguous real
estate excluding recorded subdivision lots recorded after July 1, 1983, titled
in the same ownership. However, for purposes of adding together such total area
of contiguous real estate, any noncontiguous parcel of real property included
in an agricultural, forestal or an agricultural and forestal district of local
significance pursuant to subsection B of § 15.2-4405 shall be deemed to be
contiguous to any other real property that is located in such district. For
purposes of this section, properties separated only by a public right-of-way
are considered contiguous.
   (b)   In determining the total area of real estate actively devoted to
agricultural, horticultural, forest or open space use there shall be included
the area of all real estate under barns, sheds, silos, cribs, greenhouses,
public recreation facilities and like structures, lakes, dams, ponds, streams,
irrigation ditches and like facilities; but real estate under, and such
additional real estate as may be actually used in connection with, the
farmhouse or home or any other structure not related to such special use, shall
be excluded in determining such total area.
   (c)   All structures which are located on real estate in agricultural,
horticultural, forest or open space use and the farmhouse or home or any other
structure related or not related to such special use and the real estate on
which the farmhouse or home or such other structure is located, together with
the additional real estate used in connection therewith, shall be valued,
assessed and taxed by the same standards, methods and procedures as other
taxable structures and other real estate in the locality.

      (1)   Historic resource protection. The property must be at least five
acres in size, excluding homesite and other non-qualifying land; be listed as
an historic property or a contributing property in an historic district on the

   (a)   The owner of any real estate meeting the criteria set forth in
Sections 58.1-3230, 58.1-3231 and 58.1-3233(2) of the Code of Virginia of 1950,

classification, assessment and taxation of such property for the next
succeeding tax year on the basis of its use, under the procedures set forth in
Section 58.1-3234 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended. However, any
land lying in planned development, industrial or commercial zoning districts
established prior to January 1, 1980, shall be excluded from assessment and
taxation under the provisions of this chapter. Such application shall be on
forms prepared by the Department of Taxation and supplied by the Commissioner
of the Revenue and shall include such additional schedules, photographs and
drawings as may be required by the Commissioner of the Revenue.
(Ord. 93-09. Passed 9-1-93; Ord. 01-07. Passed 11-19-01.)
   (b)   A separate application shall be filed for each parcel for which
special use assessment is sought.
   (c)   All applications under this chapter shall be accompanied by an
application fee, payable to the County of Loudoun, of one hundred twenty-five

parcel sought to be classified, assessed, and taxed under this chapter.
   (d)   Every sixth year from the date of the original application, the

dollars ($125.00) plus one dollar ($1.00) per acre or portion thereof per
parcel sought to be classified, assessed, and taxed under this chapter.

portion of any land previously approved for taxation on the basis of use
assessment.
   (f)   An application or revalidation may be filed after the specified annual
filing deadline of November 1, but not later than December 5, upon payment of

848.04   SLIDING SCALE DEFERRAL FOR PROPERTY HELD FOR LONGER PERIODS IN
QUALIFYING USE.
   (a)   Any property otherwise qualifying for use value taxation under Article
4, Chapter 32, Title 58.1 of the Code of Virginia, as amended, and this
section, may qualify for additional deferral of taxes upon a recorded
commitment to keep the property in its qualifying use for a term of years. The
portion of additional taxes deferred shall be in accordance with the following
scale:
      (1)   In the event of a commitment to hold the property in its qualifying
use for more than ten years, but not exceeding twenty years, ninety-nine
percent of the use value taxes otherwise assessed may be deferred for the term
of the commitment.
      (2)   In the event of a commitment to hold the property in its qualifying
use for more than five years, but not exceeding ten years, fifty percent of the
use value taxes otherwise assessed may be deferred for the term of the
commitment.
   (b)   To qualify for the additional deferral, the property owner must
execute a written agreement which sets forth the property subject to the
restriction, the nature of the restriction and the period of time that the
property shall remain restricted to its qualifying use. The written agreement
shall be in a form approved by the County Attorney, executed by the County and
recorded in the land records. The County Administrator, or his or her designee,
is delegated all necessary authority to prepare and execute agreements on
behalf of the County.
   (c)   For any property entering into a written agreement and receiving
deferral under the terms of this section, any roll back taxes shall be
calculated in accordance with Section 58.1-3237(C) of the Code of Virginia, as
amended. All other provisions of Article 4, Chapter 32, Title 58.1, of the Code
of Virginia, as amended, and this chapter, not inconsistent with this section,
shall apply.
   (d)   This section is in addition to the use value tax deferral program
established under the other provisions of this chapter. Subject to the
calculation of roll back taxes pursuant to Section 58.1-3237(B) of the Code of
Virginia, as amended, landowners may participate in the use value tax deferral
program subject to the other provisions of this chapter without the requirement
of entering into a written agreement.
   (e)   The provisions of this section shall be implemented beginning with the
tax year 2001 for property owners applying on or before December 5, 2000.

placed on the land book before delivery to the County Treasurer, and the tax
for the next succeeding tax year shall be extended from the use value.

848.06   CHANGE IN USE OR ZONING OF REAL ESTATE ASSESSED; ROLL-BACK TAXES.
   (a)   There is hereby imposed a roll-back tax in such amount as may be
determined under Section 58.1-3237 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended,
including interest at a rate of five-sixths of one percent per month, or
fraction thereof, upon any property whose use changes to a nonqualifying use,
or upon any property which is rezoned at the request of the owner or their
agent to allow any use more intensive than the use for which such property
qualifies for special assessment.
   (b)   As set forth in Section 58.1-3237 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, the
roll-back tax shall be equal to the sum of the deferred tax for each of the
five most recent complete tax years including simple interest on such roll-back
taxes at a rate set by the governing body, no greater than the rate applicable
to delinquent taxes in such locality pursuant to § 58.1-3916 for each of the
tax years. The deferred tax for each year shall be equal to the difference
between the tax levied and the tax that would have been levied based on the
fair market value assessment of the real estate for that year. In addition, the
taxes for the current year shall be extended on the basis of fair market value
which may be accomplished by means of a supplemental assessment based upon the
difference between the use value and the fair market value.
   (c)   Parcels receiving additional deferral in accordance with Chapter
848.04 shall be subject to roll-back tax equal to the sum of the deferral tax
from the effective date of the written agreement including simple interest on
such roll-back taxes or five years, whichever is greater pursuant to Section
58.1-3237(C) of the Code of Virginia of 1950.
(Ord. 87-07. Passed 6-15-87; Ord. 12-16. Passed 12-5-12; Ord. 23-04. Passed 2-
7-23.)
848.061   CHANGE IN ZONING OF REAL ESTATE ASSESSED; NO ROLL- BACK TAXES; REPORT
OF CHANGES.
   When the zoning of any property taxed under this chapter is changed to allow
a more intensive nonagricultural use at the request of the owner or their
agent, such property shall not be eligible for assessment and taxation under
this chapter. This shall not apply, however, to property which is zoned
agricultural and is subsequently rezoned to a more intensive use which is
complementary to agricultural use, provided such property continues to be owned
by the same owner who owned the property prior to rezoning and such owner
continues to operate the agricultural activity on the property.
   The owner of any real estate receiving a deferral under this chapter shall
report to the Commissioner of the Revenue, on forms to be prescribed, any
rezoning or change in the use of such property to a nonqualifying use within
sixty (60) days following such rezoning or change in use.
(Ord. 87-07. Passed 6-15-87; Ord. 23-04. Passed 2-7-23.)
848.062   SUBDIVISION; ROLL-BACK TAXES.
   (a)   For any tract presently valued, assessed and taxed under the
provisions of this chapter, the separation or split-off of lots or parcels from
the tract by conveyance, recordation of a subdivision plat, partition or any
other means shall subject such lots to liability for roll-back taxes which
shall be assessed and paid in accordance with Section 848.06. However, no such
lot resulting from a subdivision shall be subject to roll-back taxes if.
      (1)   The owner so subdividing the tract to create such lots attests that
such lots shall be used for one or more of the purposes or uses (agricultural,
horticultural, forestal or open- space) set forth in Section 58.1-3230 of the
Code of Virginia, as amended, (“Qualifying Purpose(s) or Use(s)”), provided
that such subdivision and attestation satisfy the following requirements:
         A.   The subdivision shall be accomplished by the recordation of a
plat approved by the County or, if provided by law, approved by order of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
         B.   Such plat shall contain a statement subscribed and sworn to by
all owners of the tract stating: “The lots resulting from this subdivision
shall be used for one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 58.1-3230 of
the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended”; or
         C.   Within sixty days after the date of recordation of such plat,
there shall be filed with the Commissioner of the Revenue an affidavit, on a
form to be provided by the Commissioner of the Revenue, subscribed and sworn to
by all owners of the tract and referencing the correct tax map and parcel
number(s) of the tract, which:
            1.   States that the tract is being subdivided;
            2.   Specifies the particular qualifying purpose(s) or uses) for
which the lots resulting from the subdivision shall be used; and
            3.   Acknowledges that the failure of any owner of any such lot to
put such lot to such qualifying purpose(s) or use(s) and to continue such
purpose or use for a period of one year after the recordation of such
subdivision plat shall raise a presumption that such lot was not intended for
such purpose or use and shall subject such lot to liability for roll- back
taxes as of the date of recordation of such subdivision plat.
               The attestation requirements set forth in this paragraph (a)
(1)C. shall be deemed satisfied for any lot resulting from the recordation of a
subdivision which subjects each lot in such subdivision to a permanent open
space conservation easement to preclude further subdivision and which satisfies
all other requirements of the Loudoun County Zoning Code for a low- density
development, as set forth in Section 5-701, a Rural Hamlet Conservancy Lot, as
set forth in Section 5-702, or a Rural Village Conservancy or Satellite
Conservancy Lot, as set forth in Section 4-1200; and
      (2)   States that such lot meets the minimum acreage and use requirements
for the qualifying purpose(s) or use(s), as set forth in Section 58.1-3233 of
the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, and this chapter.
   (b)   The provisions of this section shall apply retroactively to all lots
which, prior to the adoption of this section, have been removed from the Land
Use Program by the Commissioner of the Revenue and/or subjected to liability
for roll-back taxes, where such removal and/or subjection to liability was
based solely upon the separation or split-off of such lots, provided, however,
that the owners who separated or split-off such lots, or the owners of any such
lots, shall, no later than May 31, 1994, file an affidavit with the
Commissioner of the Revenue in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(C) hereof. For
any lot against which such roll-back taxes have been imposed, such taxes shall
be abated, as to the taxes, penalties and interest, upon the timely receipt of
such attestation.

848.063   PAYMENT OF ROLL-BACK TAX; FAILURE TO REPORT CHANGE IN PROPERTY
QUALIFICATION; MISSTATEMENTS OF FACT; PENALTY FOR DELINQUENCY.
   (a)   The Commissioner of the Revenue shall determine and assess the roll-
back tax in accordance with Section 58.1-3237 of the Code of Virginia, as
amended, and the owner of the property at the time the rezoning or change to a
nonqualifying use occurs shall pay such amount to the County Treasurer within
thirty days of the assessment. If such owner fails to pay the amount due within
thirty days of the assessment, the County Treasurer shall impose a penalty and
interest on the amount of the roll-back tax, including interest for prior
years. Such penalty and interest shall be imposed in accordance with Section
860.02 and 860.03 of these Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 9-19-89; Ord. 01-07. Passed 11-19-01.)
   (b)   Any person making a material misstatement of fact in any application
or revalidation filed pursuant hereto shall be liable for all taxes, in such
amounts and at such times as if such property had been assessed on the basis of
fair market value as applied to other real estate in the taxing jurisdiction,
together with interest and penalties thereon, and he shall be further assessed
with an additional penalty of 100 percent of such unpaid taxes.

848.07   REMOVAL OF PARCELS FROM PROGRAM IF TAXES ARE DELINQUENT.
   (a)   If on April 1 of any year the taxes for any prior year on any parcel
of real property that has a special assessment as provided for in this article
are delinquent, the county treasurer shall forthwith send notice of that fact
and the general provisions of this section to the property owner by first-class
mail. If, after the notice has been sent, such delinquent taxes remain unpaid
on June 1, the treasurer shall notify the appropriate Commissioner of the
Revenue who shall remove such parcel from the land use program. Such removal
shall become effective for the current tax year.
   (b)   No parcel of real property shall be removed from the land use program
for delinquent taxes if (i) the taxes become delinquent during a state of
emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to subdivision (7) of § 44-146.17;
(ii) the treasurer determines that the disaster giving rise to the state of
emergency has caused hardship for the taxpayer; and (iii) the delinquent taxes
are paid no later than 90 days after the deadline provided in subsection a, as
applicable.

848.08   APPLICATION OF STATE LAW.

erroneous assessments. For such purposes, the roll-back taxes shall be
considered to be deferred real estate taxes.

853.01 LICENSE TAX ON OWNERS OF CERTAIN MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (a)   A license tax of one hundred dollars ($100.00) annually shall be
imposed upon the owners of motor vehicles that do not display current Virginia
license plates and that are not exempted from the requirements of displaying
such license plates under the provisions of Article 6 (§ 46.2-662 et seq.) of
Chapter 6 of Title 46.2, §§ 46.2-1554 and 46.2-1555, are not in a public dump,
in an “automobile graveyard” as defined in § 33.2-804, or in the possession of
a licensed junk dealer or licensed motor vehicle dealer. Nothing in this
section shall be applicable to any vehicle being held or stored by or at the
direction of any governmental authority, to any vehicle owned by a member of
the armed forces on active duty or to any vehicle regularly stored within a
structure. Such ordinance shall exempt from such tax any vehicle being held or
stored on private property for the purpose of restoration or repair or for
removing parts for the repair of another vehicle.
   (b)   The tax authorized under this section shall be assessed, billed, and
collected under the same schedule and using the same process as the assessment
and billing of personal property taxes; except that, the license tax authorized
by this section shall be a flat tax, not otherwise subject to proration. The
entire $100 flat tax shall be charged for any year, or for any part of a year,
in which the vehicle has been determined to have taxable situs in Loudoun
County and in which the vehicle does not otherwise display required Virginia
license plates in accordance with Title 46.2 of the Va. Code. No refund or
proration of this tax shall occur in the year in which a vehicle comes into
compliance and first registers the vehicle with the Virginia Department of
Motor Vehicles and displays a current Virginia license plate.
(Ord. 19-08. Passed 4-10-19.)
853.02 PENALTY ON UNREGISTERED VEHICLES.
   (a)   A penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) shall be imposed upon
the resident owner of any motor vehicle that, following the end of the first 60
days of residency in the Commonwealth has not registered such vehicle in
Virginia. The penalty shall be imposed upon the resident owner annually for as
long as the motor vehicle remains unregistered in Virginia. Since Loudoun
County Ordinance 860.04 allows a resident owner 60 days from the date situs is
acquired to file vehicle personal property such penalty will not be imposed
until after the end of the 60-day residency period.
   (b)   Each penalty levied pursuant to this section shall be in addition to
the one hundred dollars ($100) motor vehicle license tax imposed under Section
853.01. The penalty shall be assessed by the Commissioner of the Revenue and
collected by the Treasurer in the same manner as the motor vehicle license tax
imposed under Section
853.01.
   (c)   The Commissioner of the Revenue or his designee, may waive the penalty
authorized by this section if the owner of the vehicle voluntarily registers it
in Virginia within 60 days after the end of the 60-day residency period.

860.01   PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Real Estate. Payment of taxes due and owing to the County for real
estate shall be paid by, or on behalf of, persons owing such taxes on a semi-
annual basis. One-half of the amount due and owing shall be paid by June 5 of
the tax year and one-half of the amount due and owing shall be paid by the next
following December 5.
   (b)   Personal Property and Machinery and Tools. Except for motor vehicles,
boats and trailers, payment of taxes due and owing to the County for personal
property, including business personal property, and machinery and tools shall
be paid by, or on behalf of, persons owing such taxes on a semiannual basis.
One-half of the amount due and owing shall be paid by May 5 of the tax year and
one-half of the amount due and owing shall be paid by the next following
October 5.
   (c)   Proration of Tax on Motor Vehicles, Trailers and Boats. Personal
property tax shall be levied upon motor vehicles, trailers and boats which have
a situs within the County as of January 1 of any tax year. Personal property
tax shall be levied upon motor vehicles, trailers and boats which acquire a
situs within the County after January 1 of any tax year for the remaining
portion of the tax year.
   Payment of taxes for any motor vehicle, trailer or boat which is subject to
assessment on or before April 1 of a tax year shall be paid on a semiannual
basis. For any motor vehicle, trailer or boat subject to assessment on January
1 of the tax year, one-half of the amount due and owing shall be paid by May 5
of the tax year and one-half of the amount due and owing shall be paid by the
next following October 5. For any motor vehicle, trailer or boat subject to
assessment after January 1, but not later than April 1 of the tax year, the
first payment shall be paid by May 5 of the tax year and shall be calculated
based on the number of months the motor vehicle, trailer or boat was subject to
taxation in the County during the first six months of the tax year as a
proportion of the total number of months the motor vehicle, trailer or boat is
subject to taxation in the County for the tax year. The second payment shall be
due October 5 of the tax year for the balance of the taxes due for the tax
year.
   Payment of taxes for any motor vehicle, trailer or boat which is subject to
assessment after April 1, but no later than August 1, of a tax year, shall be
paid by October 5 of the tax year.
   Payment of taxes for any motor vehicle, trailer or boat which is subject to
assessment after August 1 of a tax year shall be paid by December 5 of the tax
year.
   If the Commissioner of the Revenue ascertains that any property which should
have been assessed during a tax year has not been assessed for any tax year of
the three prior years, or that the same has been assessed at less than the law
required for any one or more of such years, or that the taxes thereon, for any
cause, have not been realized, the Commissioner shall assess the same with
taxes at the rate prescribed for that year and the Treasurer shall mail a tax
bill for such previously omitted taxes, with payment due dates on the following
February 5th, May 5th, October 5th or December 5th, as applicable and as
indicated in the tax bill. No penalty or interest will be added if taxes are
paid within thirty days from the tax bill date, provided such assessment was
omitted through no fault of the taxpayer. If such assessment was omitted
through fault of the taxpayer, penalty and interest may be added from the first
day following the due date in the year in which such taxes should have been
paid and shall accrue thereon from such date until payment in full.
   When any motor vehicle, trailer or boat loses its situs and is no longer
registered in the County or the owner of a motor vehicle, trailer or boat
transfers title of it after January 1 of the tax year, any tax assessed on such
motor vehicle, trailer or boat shall be abated, and any amount of the tax
already paid shall be refunded, on a prorated basis for the remaining portion
of the tax year. However, no refund shall be made if the motor vehicle, trailer
or boat acquires a situs within the Commonwealth in a non-prorating county or
city.
   Any person who moves from a non-prorating county or city to the County in a
single year shall be entitled to a property tax credit in the County if:
      (1)   The person was liable for the whole year for personal property
taxes on a motor vehicle, trailer or boat and has paid such taxes to the non-
prorating county or city; and
      (2)   The owner replaces, for any reason, the original motor vehicle,
trailer or boat upon which taxes are due to the non-prorating county or city
during such tax year.
   The County shall provide a credit against the total tax due on the new motor
vehicle, trailer or boat in an amount equal to the tax paid to the non-
prorating county or city for the period of time commencing with the disposition
of the original vehicle, trailer or boat and continuing through the close of
the tax year in which the owner incurred tax liability to the non-prorating
county or city for the original motor vehicle, trailer or boat.
   If a taxpayer claims either to have paid taxes on a motor vehicle, trailer,
boat or airplane to another jurisdiction during the same period or to have
registered during the same period such motor vehicle, trailer, boat or airplane
elsewhere, such taxpayer should present to the County sufficient evidence of
the payment or registration.
   For purposes of this section, proration shall be determined on a monthly
basis, with a period of one-half of a month or more counted as a full month and
a period of less than one-half of a month not counted as a month.

   (a)   Where the taxes referred to in Section
860.01 have not been paid by the close of business on the date the taxes are
due, or the first business day thereafter if the due date is not a business
day, there shall be due and owing by such taxpayer to the County a penalty in
the amount of ten percent of the tax past due on such property, or ten dollars
($10.00), whichever shall be greater, but not to exceed the amount of the tax.
Any such penalty when so assessed shall become a part of the tax.
   (b)   In addition to the penalty in paragraph (a) above, where a personal
property tax referred to in Section
860.01, remains unpaid, in whole or in part, 60 days after the payment due
date, the taxpayer shall incur an additional penalty in the amount of 15% of
the due and unpaid portion of the base tax, provided, however, that the penalty
shall not exceed the amount of the tax. Any such penalty when so assessed shall
become a part of the tax.

   In addition to the penalty for failure to pay the taxes on time, there shall
be due and owing by such taxpayer to the County an additional sum as interest
at the rate of ten percent per year. Such sum shall be computed on a monthly
basis beginning the first day following the day such payment is due, until the
day of actual payment of such sum, and shall be computed at the annual rate of
ten percent on the total sum of such taxes owed, including any penalty
applicable thereto, for each calendar month.

860.12   PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX RELIEF.
   (a)   Purpose; Definitions. The purpose of this section in to provide for
the implementation of changes to the Personal Property Tax Relief Act of 1998
(Va. Code § 58.1-3523. et seq.; “PPTRA” or “the Act”) made by legislation
adopted during the 2004 Special Session I and the 2005 Regular Session of the
Virginia General Assembly. The terms used in this section that have defined
meanings in the Act shall have the same meanings as set forth in Va. Code §
58.1-3523 as amended by Chapter 1 of the 2004 Acts of Assembly (Special Session
I). To the extent that the provisions of this section conflict with any other
portion of the Codified Ordinances of Loudoun County, this section shall
control.
   (b)   Method of Computing and Reflecting the Allocation of Tax Relief. For
the tax year beginning January 1, 2006, and all subsequent tax years, tax
relief shall be a specific dollar amount offset against the total personal
property taxes that would otherwise be due on a Qualifying Vehicle but for
PPTRA, calculated as a percentage of such total personal property tax due,
pursuant to Item 503, Chapter 951 of the 2005 Acts of Assembly (“the 2005
Appropriations Act”). The amount of relief credited, both as a specific dollar
amount and as a percentage, shall be shown on the tax bill for each Qualifying
Vehicle, together with an explanation of the general manner in which relief is
allocated.
   (c)   Implementation of Tax Relief. Pursuant to Item 503(E) of the 2005
Appropriations Act, the Board of Supervisors shall, by resolution adopted prior
to April 1st, annually as part of a regular Board agenda, set the percentage
rate (or rates) of tax relief for the first twenty thousand dollars ($20,000)
of value of Qualifying Vehicles at such a level that it is anticipated to fully
exhaust the PPTRA relief funds provided to the County by the Commonwealth of
Virginia and comply with the requirements of Va. Code § 58.1-3524(C)(2).

864.01   EXEMPTIONS FROM PENALTY AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Determinations of Fault. Where a taxpayer establishes that his or her
failure to pay either a license fee or tax, personal property tax or real
estate tax, or any part thereof, or to file a personal property return or a
business or professional license application or other return, as required by
State law or County ordinance, was not in any way the fault of such taxpayer,
he or she shall not be required to pay any corresponding penalty or interest
otherwise owing as the result of such nonpayment or failure to file. This
provision shall be administered by the County Treasurer and the County
Commissioner of the Revenue as their jurisdictional interests apply, provided
that matters of late filing which do not involve matters of late payment are
solely the jurisdictional responsibility of the Commissioner of the Revenue.
   If the County Treasurer determines, pursuant to this section, that the
taxpayer's failure to pay a tax when due was not the fault of the taxpayer,
then the taxpayer shall, within thirty days after written notification from the
Treasurer that such taxes are due, pay all such taxes. If such taxes have not
been paid to the County by the close of business on the thirtieth day after
written notification from the Treasurer, or by the first business day
thereafter if the thirtieth day is not a business day, there shall be due and
owing by the taxpayer to the County a penalty in the amount specified in
Section
860.02. Any such penalty when so assessed shall become a part of the tax.
Interest on such tax shall be computed as specified in Section
860.03 of these Ordinances.
   (b)   Transfer of Real Property. If a transfer of real property ownership
occurs after January 1 of a tax year, and a real estate tax bill has been
mailed pursuant to Va. Code § 58.1-3912, the Treasurer, upon ascertaining that
a property transfer has occurred in the tax year or the next ensuing tax year,
may invalidate a bill sent to the prior owner and reissue the bill to the new
owner as permitted by §§ 58.1-3916 and 58.1-3912. No penalty for failure to pay
any tax for any such assessment shall be imposed if the tax is paid within 30
days after the notice thereof is mailed.
(Ord. 86-10. Passed 10 20-86; Ord. 04-07. Passed 4-20-04; Ord. 04-10. Passed 6-
8-04; Ord. 18- 14. Passed 7-11-18.)
864.02   ERRONEOUSLY ASSESSED LEVIES.
   (a)   Application for Assessment Corrections. Upon written application by
any taxpayer for a refund or exoneration of erroneously assessed levies, if the
Commissioner of the Revenue is satisfied that an applicant has been erroneously
assessed with a County levy on real estate, tangible personal property,
machinery and tools, merchant's capital or a license tax or fee, the
Commissioner of the Revenue shall certify to the County Treasurer the amount
erroneously assessed. If such erroneously assessed levies have not been paid,
the applicant shall be exonerated from payment of so much thereof as is
erroneous. If such levies have been paid, the Treasurer shall refund to the
applicant the amount erroneously paid, together with any penalties and interest
paid thereon.
(Ord. 80-13. Passed 10-20-80.)
   (b)   Successor to Commissioner of the Revenue. When the County Commissioner
of the Revenue who made the erroneous assessment has been succeeded by another
person, such person shall have the same authority as the Commissioner making
the original erroneous assessment, provided he/she makes diligent investigation
to determine that the original assessment was erroneously made and certifies
thereto to the County Treasurer.
   (c)   Refund. No refund shall be made in any case when the refund
application is made more than three years from the last day of the tax year for
which such assessment is made, or within one year from the date of the
assessment, whichever is later. No refund of less than five dollars shall be
issued to a taxpayer, unless specifically requested by the taxpayer pursuant to
Va. Code § 58.1-3516.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (d)   Interest. If taxes based on the erroneous assessment have been paid,
the erroneously assessed and paid taxes shall be refunded with interest at the
annual rate of ten percent on the total sum of the taxes overpaid, including
any penalty or delinquency interest applicable thereto charged and paid;
provided, however, that no interest shall be paid on such refund if (i) the
amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, or (ii) the refund is the
result of a proration pursuant to Va. Code § 58.1-3516. Such interest shall be
computed on a monthly basis beginning with the date such taxes were required to
be paid, or were in fact paid, whichever is later.

property tax rate for machinery and tools to the value of the total machinery
and tools tax due on such equipment, facilities, or devices, for a total period
of ten years.
   (b)   For projects that meet the requirements outlined in subsections
868.05(d)(iii),

subsection 868.08(a) except that the percentage of the assessment and period of
time shall be as follows: 80 percent of the assessed value in the first five
years in service after commencement of commercial operation, 70 percent of the
assessed value in the second five years in service, and 60 percent of the
assessed value for all remaining years in service.
   (c)   For purposes of the administration of this section, and for no other
purpose, the value of certified solar energy equipment, facilities or devices
qualifying for exemption shall be presumed to be not less than the normal cost
of purchasing and installing such equipment, facilities or devices.

year next succeeding the year in which application for exemption is made. For

projects that meet the requirements outlined in subsections
868.05(d)(iii),

GENERAL PROVISIONS
870.01   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to implement the provisions of Section 58.1-
3220, of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, which authorizes the County
to provide partial exemption from real estate taxation for qualifying
rehabilitated, renovated or replacement residential structures. Such exemptions
will provide an economic incentive to owners to improve their properties. These
improvements will help to prevent the deterioration and abandonment of older
residential properties, which is detrimental to the health and welfare of the
County and its citizens. In addition, such exemptions may encourage the
modification of residential structures to meet the needs of the County's
disabled or elderly citizens.
(Ord. 01-03. Passed 5-21-01.)

rehabilitation exemption is in effect shall not result in an increase in the
exemption.
   (d)   The tax exemption for substantially rehabilitated residential real
estate shall be effective on January 1 of the year following completion of such
rehabilitation. The exemption shall be a credit against real estate taxes and
shall run with the land for a period of fifteen years, provided that the
provisions of Section

application shall be considered complete or will be processed until receipt of
such information.

to the County with each application. No application for the exemption approved
by this chapter shall be deemed to have been filed until the fee has been paid.
   (d)   Upon receipt of a completed application for exemption and immediately
before the proposed rehabilitation work begins, the local assessing official
shall inspect the structure.
   (e)   After the rehabilitation is complete, the owner shall submit a written
request (by certified mail, express delivery or courier) to the local assessing
official to inspect the structure to determine if it then qualifies for the
exemption. Such inspection and determination shall be made by the local
assessing official within sixty days after such written request is received by
the local assessing official. If the property qualifies for the exemption under
the provisions of this chapter, then the tax exemption shall become effective
beginning January 1 of the next calendar year after the request for inspection
is received by the local assessing official.
(Ord. 01-03. Passed 5-21-01; Ord. 12-16. Passed 12-5-12.)
870.07   ELIGIBILITY.
   (a)   No improvements made on vacant land nor total replacement of
residential structures shall be eligible for the rehabilitated real estate tax
exemption.
   (b)   No property shall be eligible for the rehabilitated real estate tax
exemption unless:
      (1)   All necessary building permits have been acquired;
      (2)   All work is completed within twelve months from the date the
initial building permit was issued;
      (3)   The County Assessor has verified that the rehabilitation indicated
on the application has been completed;
      (4)   The use of the property as of the date of application continues
without change; and
      (5)   The property owner is current in payment of all taxes, assessments
and other fees due to the County.
   (c)   Applications for exemption must be filed prior to January 1 of the
taxable year for which such exemption is claimed.
   (d)   No structure shall be eligible for the exemption if access for the
purpose of assessing the structure and determining whether the requirements of
this chapter have been met is denied.
   (e)   No property shall be eligible for the exemption if that property is
substantially rehabilitated by the demolition and replacement of any structure
that is:
      (1)   A registered Virginia landmark; or
      (2)   Determined by the Department of Historic Resources to contribute to
the significance of a registered historic district.
   (f)   Prior to a determination that the property has been substantially
rehabilitated as defined by this chapter, the owner of the property shall
continue to be subject to taxation upon the full value of the property.
   (g)   No property owner may apply for the exemption on the basis of a
building permit issued on or before January 1, 2001. Owners of property on
which such improvements were completed prior to January 1, 2001, shall not be
eligible for the exemption prescribed by this chapter, and further shall not be
eligible for refund or adjustment of taxes payable prior to January 1, 2001.
   (h)   Except in instances in which an improved property has been
substantially damaged by an action that is beyond the control of the owner or
occupant, as defined below, no improved property which has qualified for the
exemption pursuant to this chapter shall be eligible to submit any application
for further exemption based on subsequent improvements during the pendency of
the initial exemption period. If an improved property qualified for the
exemption pursuant to this chapter is damaged by an action beyond the control
of the owner or occupant, and if the property may otherwise qualify for the
exemption pursuant to this chapter, then the owner of the real estate may apply
for the exemption based on the then-present value of the damaged property, and
the qualification for the new exemption shall supersede and extinguish any
exemption that may have been available under the previous qualification. For
the purposes of this chapter, the term “action that is beyond the control of
the owner or occupant” shall include fire, flood and windstorm that reduces the
fair market value of the property by no less than thirty percent.
   (i)   If a structure was built and later expanded after the initial
construction, then the age of the structure and its eligibility for the
exemption shall be determined by the age of that portion of the structure which
constitutes not less than two-thirds of the total square footage of the entire
structure.
(Ord. 01-03. Passed 5-21-01.)
870.08   ADMINISTRATION OF EXEMPTION.
   (a)   In determining the base value and the increased value resulting from
substantial rehabilitation of residential real estate, the local assessing
official shall employ usual and customary methods of assessing real estate.
   (b)   If a tax exemption is approved and a property owner (including any
subsequent owner) thereafter fails to remain current in the payment of all
County taxes and assessments, the property shall be immediately and finally
removed from the exemption program.
   (c)   In any year in which the fair market value of the qualified real
estate decreases below the base value, as determined pursuant to this chapter,
no credit or refund shall be provided to the owner.

assessing official to list upon the Land Book any reduced value due to the

taxes or levies shall be computed on the full fair market value of all

determination that a rental business previously certified as a short-term
rental business, pursuant to Section

880.01(i) during the preceding tax year, such business shall lose its

   (b)   In the event that a rental business loses its certification as a
short-term rental business pursuant to this section, such business shall not be
required to refund to customers short-term rental taxes previously collected in
good faith and shall not be subject to assessment for business personal
property taxes with respect to rental property for tax years preceding the year
in which the certification is lost unless the Commissioner of the Revenue makes
a written determination that the business obtained its certification by
knowingly making materially false statements in its application, in which case
the Commissioner of the Revenue may assess the taxpayer the amount of the
difference between short-term rental taxes remitted by such business during the
period in which the taxpayer wrongfully held certification and the business
personal property taxes that would have been due during such period but for the
certification obtained by the making of the materially false statements.
   (c)   A short-term rental business that has been decertified pursuant to

884.02   LEVY AND RATE OF TAX.
   In addition to all other taxes of every kind now or hereafter imposed by
law, there is hereby levied and imposed by the County upon every person who
sells or uses cigarettes within the County, to include any incorporated towns
that have not adopted a cigarette tax, an excise tax at a rate not to exceed 40
cents for each package containing 20 cigarettes. Furthermore, if a package
contains fewer or more than 20 cigarettes then the tax imposed will not exceed
two cents ($0.02) for each cigarette sold, stored, or received within the
County. The tax shall be paid and collected in the manner and at the time
hereinafter prescribed; provided, that the tax payable for each cigarette or
cigarette package sold or used within the County shall be paid but once.
(Ord. 21-18. Passed 9-8-21.)
884.03   METHODS OF COLLECTION.
   (a)   The tax imposed by this section shall be evidenced by the use of a tax
stamp and shall be paid by each dealer or other person liable for the tax under
a reporting method deemed by the Board to carry out the provisions of this
chapter. The stamps shall be affixed in such a manner that their removal will
require continued application of water or steam. Each dealer or other person
liable for the tax is hereby required, and it shall be his duty, to collect,
pay the tax and report all packages of cigarettes on forms prescribed for this
purpose by the Board in order to provide the following information:
      (1)   The quantity of NVCTB-stamped cigarettes sold or delivered to:
         A.   Each registered agent appointed by the Board for which no tax was
collected;
         B.   Each manufacturer's representative; and
         C.   Each separate person and place of business during the preceding
calendar or fiscal month; and
      (2)   The quantity of NVCTB stamps on hand, both affixed and unaffixed on
the first and the last day of the preceding calendar or fiscal month and the
quantity of NVCTB stamps or NVCTB stamped cigarettes received during the
preceding calendar or fiscal month; and
      (3)   The quantity of cigarettes on hand to which the NVCTB stamp had not
been affixed on the first and last day of the preceding calendar or fiscal
month and the quantity of cigarettes received during the preceding calendar or
fiscal month to which the NVCTB stamp had not been affixed; and
      (4)   Such further information as the administrator for the board may
require for the proper administration and enforcement of this chapter for the
determination of the exact number of cigarettes in the possession of each
dealer or user.
   (b)   Each dealer or other person liable for the tax shall file such reports
with the Board and pay the tax due to the Board prior to the due date and shall
furnish to the Board copies of all cigarette tax reports submitted to the
Virginia Department of Taxation.
   (c)   When, upon examination and audit of any invoices, records, books,
cancelled checks or other memoranda touching on the purchase, sale, receipt,
storage or possession of tobacco products taxed herein, any dealer or other
person liable for the tax is unable to furnish evidence to the Board of
sufficient tax payments and stamp purchases to cover cigarettes which were
sold, used, stored, received, purchased or possessed by him, the prima facie
presumption shall arise that such cigarettes were received, sold, used, stored,
purchased or possessed by him without the proper tax having been paid. The
Board shall, from the results of such examination and audit based upon such
direct or indirect information available, assess the tax due, impose a penalty
of ten percent and may impose interest of three-quarters per cent per month of
the gross tax due.
   (d)   When any dealer or other person liable for the tax files a false or
fraudulent report or fails to file a report or fails to perform any act or
performs any act to evade payment of the tax, the board shall administratively
assess the tax due and impose a penalty not to exceed 50% of the tax due and
interest of three-quarters per cent per month of the gross tax due.
   (e)   The dealer or other person liable for the tax shall be notified by
certified mail of such deficiency and such tax, penalty and interest assessed
shall be due and payable within ten days after notice of such deficiency has
been issued. Every dealer or other person liable for the tax shall examine each
package of cigarettes to ensure that the NVCTB stamp has been affixed thereto
prior to offering them for sale.
   (f)   Any dealer or other person liable for the tax who shall receive
cigarettes not bearing the NVCTB stamp shall, within one hour of receipt of
such cigarettes, commence and with all reasonable diligence continue to affix
the NVCTB stamp to each and every package of cigarettes until all unstamped
packages of cigarettes have been stamped and before offering such cigarettes
for sale. Any dealer or other person liable for the tax who has notified the
Board that he is engaged in interstate or intrastate business shall be
permitted to set aside such part of his stock as may be legally kept for the
conduct of such interstate or intrastate business (that is, cigarettes held for
sale outside the jurisdiction of the Board) without affixing the stamps
required by this chapter. Any such interstate or intrastate stock shall be kept
entirely separate and apart from the NVCTB-stamped stock, in such a manner as
to prevent the commingling of the interstate or intrastate stock with the NVCTB
stock. Any dealer or other person liable for the tax found to have had untaxed
cigarettes which have been lost, whether by negligence, theft or any other
unaccountable loss, shall be liable for and shall pay the tax due thereon.
   (g)   It shall also be the duty of each dealer or other person liable for
the tax to maintain and keep for a period of three years, not including the
current calendar year, records of all cigarettes received, sold, stored,
possessed, transferred or handled by him in any manner whatsoever, whether the
same were stamped or unstamped, to make all such records available for audit,
inspection and examination at all reasonable times, as well as the means,
facilities and opportunity for making such audit, inspection or examination
upon demand of the Board.
(Ord. 21-18. Passed 9-8-21.)
884.04   REGISTERED AGENTS.
   (a)   Any dealer or other person liable for the tax who shall sell, use,
store, possess, distribute or transport cigarettes within or into the County
shall first make application to the Board to qualify as a registered agent.
Such application, which shall be supplied upon request, shall require such
information relative to the nature of the business engaged in by said
applicant, as the Board deems necessary for the administration and enforcement
of this chapter. There is a yearly registration fee for all Wholesale Dealers
and all Cigarette Machine Operators. Applicant shall provide a surety bond to
the Board of 150% of his average monthly tax liability with a surety company
authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Such bond shall be
so written that, on timely payment of the premium thereon, it shall continue in
force from year to year. Any applicant whose place of business is outside the
County shall automatically, by filing his application, submit himself to the
Board's legal jurisdiction and appoint the Administrator for the Board as his
agent for any service or lawful process.
   Upon receipt of the properly completed required application forms, and the
required surety bond executed, the Board shall determine whether the said
applicant qualifies to be a registered agent. The Board will issue to said
qualified applicant a yearly registered agent permit to qualify him to
purchase, sell, use, store, possess, distribute or transport within or into the
County, NVCTB-stamped cigarettes.
   (b)   Registered agents shall agree to the reporting and payment
requirements placed upon him by this chapter and the rules and regulations as
from time to time may be promulgated by the Board. When any registered agent's
monthly report and payment of the tax is not received within the dates
prescribed, the Board shall impose a late reporting penalty often per cent of
the gross tax due or ten dollars whichever is greater, but in no event more
than $1,000. The Board also may require such registered agent to provide proof
that he has complied with all applicable laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia
to legally conduct such business and to file financial statements showing all
assets and liabilities. The Board may revoke or suspend any registered agent's
permit due to failure to file tax reports in a timely manner, non-payment of
taxes due, or if the cigarette tax surety bond should become impaired for any
reason.
   (c)   All money collected as cigarette taxes under this ordinance shall be
deemed to be held in trust by the dealer collecting the same until remitted to
the Board.
   (d)   Registered agents must account for all NVCTB authorized tax stamps
purchased. Periodic audits may be conducted to determine any unaccounted
variance between the number of stamps purchased and the number of stamps
reported and an assessment will be made for all unaccounted for stamps. Any
assessment of registered agents located outside the jurisdictions of the Board
will be based upon the average sates of packages of cigarettes by jurisdiction
during the audit period. For registered agents located within the jurisdictions
of the Board, any assessment will be based upon the tax rate of the
jurisdiction in which they are located. In addition, there will be a penalty
for non- reporting of ten per cent of the gross tax due.
(Ord. 21-18. Passed 9-8-21.)
884.05   REQUIREMENTS FOR RETAIL DEALERS.
   (a)   Retail dealers who shall sell, offer for sale, store, possess
distribute, purchase, receive or transport cigarettes for the purpose of sale
within the County shall purchase cigarettes only from registered agents. Retail
dealers shall provide to registered agents the business trade name and business
address of the location where the cigarettes will be placed for sale to the
public. Cigarettes purchased for personal use cannot be brought into a business
for resale. Only properly registered and licensed retail stores may sell
cigarettes to the public. To be properly registered and licensed, a retail
store must first have a valid Virginia state sales and use tax certificate and
valid retail business license. Cigarettes must be purchased and stored
separately for each business location. Ail copies of cigarette purchase
invoices/receipts must be retained by the retailer for a period of three years
and shall be made available to Agents of the NVCTB upon request for use in
conducting audits and investigations. All copies of cigarette purchase
invoices/receipts must be stored at the business retail location for a period
of one year from date of purchase. Failure to provide cigarette invoices/
receipts may result in confiscation of cigarettes until receipts can be
reviewed by the Board to verify the proper tax has been paid. It is the
responsibility of each retail location to ensure that all cigarettes placed for
sale or stored at that location are properly taxed and stamped. Cigarettes
found without the NVCTB stamp or the proper jurisdictional tax paid will be
seized by the Agents of the Board.
   (b)   Retail dealers must make their place of business available for
inspection by Tobacco Revenue Agents from the Northern Virginia Cigarette Tax
Board to ensure that all cigarettes are properly tax-stamped and all cigarette
taxes are properly paid.
(Ord. 21-18. Passed 9-8-21.)
884.06   PRESUMPTION OF ILLEGALITY; SEIZURE OF CONTRABAND GOODS, SEALING/
SEIZING OF MACHINES.
   (a)   If any cigarette machine operator or other person liable for the tax
imposed by this chapter is found to possess any cigarettes without the
jurisdictional tax paid or the proper tax stamp affixed, there shall be a
rebuttable presumption that any such operator of other person shall be in
possession of untaxed cigarettes in violation of this section.
   (b)   If any cigarettes are placed in any vending machines within the
County, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such cigarettes were
placed in that machine for sale within the County. If any vending machine
located within the County contains cigarettes upon which the NVCTB tax stamp
has not been affixed or on which the jurisdictional tax has not been paid or
containing cigarettes placed so as to not allow visual inspection of the NVCTB
tax stamp through viewing area as provided for by the vending machine
manufacturer, then there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the machine
contains untaxed cigarettes in violation of this chapter.
   (c)   Any cigarettes, vending machines, cigarette tax stamps or other
property found in violation of this chapter shall be declared contraband goods
and may be seized by the Board. In addition to any tax due, the dealer or other
person liable for the tax possessing such untaxed cigarettes or tax stamps
shall be subject to civil and criminal penalties herein provided.
   (d)   In lieu of seizure, the Board may seal such vending machines to
prevent continued illegal sale or removal of such cigarettes. The removal of
such seal from a vending machine by any unauthorized person shall be a
violation of this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the seizure of
any vending machine at any time after it is sealed.
   (e)   All cigarette vending machines shall be plainly marked with the name,
address and telephone number of the owner of said machine.
(Ord. 21-18. Passed 9-8-21.)

stamps of that jurisdiction; or

the payment of any tax prescribed by this chapter or to sell, or offer to sell,
any stamp provided for herein; or

   (e)   Continuity Standards for Proposed Street Naming: The continuation of a
proposed and/or existing street name through an intersection shall conform to
the following continuity standards, unless the Director, in his/her sole
discretion, determines that such continuation of a street name would create an
adverse impact to public safety. If such a determination is made, the Director
shall decide which street names, if any, shall continue through the
intersection. For examples of the application of continuity standards, please
see Appendix II at the end of this chapter.
      (1)   Where a proposed non-median divided right of way intersects with
and crosses an existing or proposed non-median divided right of way:
         A.   If the offset distance between centerlines is fifty feet or less,
the street name for the proposed non-median divided right of way shall continue
through the intersection.
         B.   If the offset distance between centerlines is greater than fifty
feet, the street name for the proposed non-median divided right of way shall
not continue through the intersection.
         C.   If culs-de-sac or other dead-end rights of way are created,
Section
1020.05 (e)(5) shall apply.
      (2)   Where a proposed non-median divided right of way intersects with
and crosses an existing or proposed median divided right of way:
         A.   The proposed non-median divided right of way shall be assigned
two separate street names regardless of the offset distance between
centerlines.
         B.   The street name of the median divided right of way shall continue
through the intersection.
      (3)   Where a proposed median divided right of way intersects with and
crosses an existing non-median divided right of way:
         A.   The existing non-median divided right of way shall be renamed in
accordance with Section
1020.07 (f).
         B.   The street name of the proposed median divided right of way shall
continue through the intersection.
      (4)   Where a proposed median divided right of way intersects with and
crosses an existing or proposed median divided right of way, the street names
for both median divided rights of way shall continue through the intersection.
      (5)   Where culs-de-sac or other dead-end rights of way are created:
         A.   If a proposed right of way intersects with and crosses an
existing or proposed right of way and terminates in a cul-de-sac or other dead-
end before intersecting with and crossing another right of way, the street name
for the proposed right of way shall not continue through the intersection.
         B.   If a proposed right of way intersects with but does not cross a
proposed right of way (a “T” intersection) that terminates in culs-de-sac or
other dead-ends on both sides of the intersection (forms a double-ended cul-de-
sac or dead-end), the street name for the double-ended cul-de-sac or dead-end
shall continue through the intersection.
         C.   The posting of address ranges at the entrance of the double-ended
cul-de-sac or dead-end right of way shall be required. Maintenance and
replacement of signs displaying street address ranges shall be the
responsibility of a homeowners’ association or the individual property owners
served by the cul-de-sac in accordance with

addressable structures shall be named. The Director shall also have the
authority and discretion to require any existing or proposed public or private
right of way or single-owner private access driveway accessing fewer than five
(5) properties or addressable structures to be named if the lack of a street
name has caused or would create an adverse impact to public safety. Addressable
structures served by an unnamed public or private right of way or single-owner
private access driveway serving less than five (5) properties or addressable
structures, shall be addressed using the street name of the right-of-way from
which such public or private right of way or single-owner private access
driveway originates.
   Any previously named single-owner private access driveway serving less than
five (5) properties or addressable structures may have its street name removed
upon the request of the owner. Requests for removing street names from single-
owner private access driveways shall be submitted in writing to the Department
however, the Director may choose not to approve such a request if the removal
of the street name would create an adverse impact to public safety. Addresses
for addressable structures on single-owner private access driveways for which
the owner requests either a new street name or the removal of an existing
street name will be assigned or reassigned in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 1026.

application is approved, the accepted street name shall be reserved for the
life of the preliminary subdivision application or site plan application. If a
preliminary subdivision application or site plan application is not approved

change the street names of a public or private right of way shall not be
accepted or approved after construction of, or issuance of addresses for, the
right of way in question, whichever comes first, except as provided in Section

street name has caused or would create an adverse impact to public safety.
      (2)   The Director shall have the authority and discretion to initiate
the process of renaming a right of way or single-owner private access driveway,
or portion(s) thereof, if the street name has caused or would create an adverse
impact to public safety and/or if a right of way construction project,
including but not limited to, right of way extensions, intersection
realignments, right of way relocations, and right of way vacations and
abandonments, causes the street name of a right of way or single-owner private
access driveway, or portion(s) thereof, to no longer be in conformance with the
general naming standards and the street-type abbreviations, designations, and
definitions of this chapter. For the purpose of the administration of this
section, general naming standards that apply to proposed street names shall
also apply to existing street names.
         A.   The Director’s selection of the right of way or single-owner
private access driveway, or portion(s) thereof, to be renamed may be based on
but shall not be limited to the following criteria:
            (i)   The number of properties currently addressed from the right
of way or single-owner private access driveway, or portion(s) thereof.
            (ii)   The cost to the County to rename the right of way or single-
owner private access driveway, or portion(s) thereof.

      (3)   Property that is considered to be affected by the process of
selecting a new street name for the right of way or single-owner private access
driveway, or portion(s) thereof, to be renamed shall be limited as follows:
         A.   For a public right of way, only property that is addressed from,
or is vacant and has the potential to be addressed from, the right of way, or
portion(s) thereof, in question shall be considered affected property.
         B.   For a private right of way, only property that has legal access
to use and is addressed from, or is vacant and has the potential to be
addressed from, the right of way, or portion(s) thereof, in question shall be
considered affected property.
         C.   For single-owner private access driveways, only property served
by the single-owner private access driveway in question shall be considered
affected property.
      (4)   The Director shall have the sole discretion to select proposed
street names for the right of way or single-owner private access driveway, or
portion(s) thereof, to be named or renamed.
         A.   The Director shall select only one (1) proposed street name for
the right of way or single-owner private access driveway, or portion(s)
thereof, to be named or renamed, if, in the Director’s sole discretion, the use
of any other street name would create an adverse impact to public safety. If
only one (1) street name is selected by the Director, the Director shall
provide at least one (1) owner of each affected property with written notice of
the proposed naming or renaming. Such notice shall provide said affected
property owners with a minimum thirty (30) day comment period and specify the
date by which written objections in regard to the proposed naming or renaming
shall be submitted to the Department. Such notice shall also provide said
affected property owners with a description of the basis for the proposed
naming or renaming, the process for such naming or renaming, and the process
for submitting written objections to the Department. Written objections shall,
at a minimum, describe the basis for the objection. Written objections
postmarked after the specified date shall not be accepted. If no written
objections postmarked before or on the specified date are received, the
Director shall approve the proposed naming or renaming, and shall provide at
least one (1) owner of each affected property with written notice of the new
street name and its effective date. If any written objections postmarked before
or on the specified date are received, the Director shall forward the proposed
naming or renaming, and copies of all accepted written objections, to the Board
of Supervisors for action.
         B.   If, in the Director’s sole discretion, the use of other street
names for the right of way or single-owner private access driveway, or portion
(s) thereof, to be named or renamed, would not cause an adverse impact to
public safety, the Director shall request a list of proposed street names from
the affected property owners. Department staff shall review the list of
proposed street names for conformance with the applicable sections of this
chapter and these Codified Ordinances. If a proposed street name is not in
conformance, Department staff shall assist the property owner(s) with
generating an approvable street name. Once said list contains only approvable
street names, the Director shall compile the street names on a ballot for
voting, and provide one (1) copy of such ballot to at least one (1) owner of
each affected property. Each affected property shall be provided one (1) vote,
regardless of the property’s actual number of owners. The Director shall
provide said affected property owners with a minimum thirty (30) day period to
return the ballot, and the ballot shall specify the date by which the ballot
shall be returned to the Department. Ballots postmarked after the specified
date shall not be accepted.
            (i)   Nonowner residents (renters or tenants) of an affected
property shall not participate in the voting process.
            (ii)   The street name with the majority of votes from the accepted
ballots shall be approved by the Director. In the event that there is no
participation from the affected property owners, the Director shall select and
approve a street name for the right of way or single-owner private access
driveway, or portion(s) thereof, in question. The Director shall provide at
least one (1) owner of each affected property with written notice of the new
street name and its effective date.
            (iii)   In the event that none of the proposed street names
receives a majority of votes from the accepted ballots, the Director shall
forward the proposed naming or renaming to the Board of Supervisors for action.
      (5)   Each action of the Board of Supervisors in regard to a street
naming or renaming pursuant to this section shall contain specific findings in
regard to the stated purpose and intent of this chapter as follows:
         A.   Whether the proposed naming or renaming would facilitate the
provision of adequate public safety services.
         B.   Whether the proposed naming or renaming would relieve conditions
causing difficulty in locating properties and buildings for Loudoun County
Departments, the general public, and others.
         C.   Whether the proposed naming or renaming would further the
provision of a uniform system of street naming for all properties throughout
Loudoun County.
      (6)   If the action of the Board of Supervisors approved a proposed
naming or renaming, the effective date of the new street name shall be thirty
(30) days from the date of the Board of Supervisors’ action, unless a different
date is directed by the Board.
         A.   Within five (5) business days of the adoption of such an action,
the Department shall provide at least one (1) owner of each affected property
with written notice of the new street name and its effective date.

pin, made of either stainless steel, zinc or cadmium plated steel. Post top and
cross brackets shall be cast or machined to receive extruded blades with a
0.090 web and a 0.250 flange thickness. Six vandalproof twelve-point spline
head bolts and four hex-head set screws with center pin shall be furnished with
each set of brackets. The complete unit shall be rigidly fastened together and
shall be theft proof when fastened to the post.
   (f)   The shorter name plate sign shall be mounted above the longer name
plate in the assembly.
   (g)   The bottom of the lowest street name plate shall be ten feet above
ground level, except at signalized intersections. At signalized intersections,
the bottom of the lowest street name plate shall be at least sixteen feet above
ground level, detailed in Drawing B and Drawing C following the text of this
chapter.
   (h)   At signalized intersections, street name signs for both streets will
be installed on all vertical supports for traffic signals. Signs will be
mounted with standard aluminum cantilevered pole mounted street name brackets
as herein provided:
      (1)   The brackets shall be cast of high-strength aluminum alloy or an
approved noncorrosive alternative, degreased, tumbled and polished to a low-
sheen smooth finish to ensure resistance to the accumulation of dirt and
weather-borne deposits which might wash down upon the street name sign blades
and cause premature defacement of the sign.
      (2)   The brackets shall be “L” shaped in design, with one leg of the L
being seven and one-fourth inches long and intended for attachment to the
upright support, and the other leg being fourteen and one-half inches long and
intended to cantilever out from the support to provide bracing for the sign
against both vertical and lateral forces. The design of the bracket shall make
it suitable either for nailing, screwing or banding to wood supports, or for
bolting or banding to metal supports. The leg for attachment to the support
shall be equipped with three-eighths inch holes one- inch on center, or
multiples thereof, to match standard spacing of holes in channel posts.
      (3)   The bracket shall be designed to accept and support the sign in the
angle of the L, and each leg of the L shall have an integrally cast block,
containing a vertical slot with minimum dimensions one inch long, one inch deep
and 0.140 inch wide for securing the sign blade to the bracket.
      (4)   The sides of all slots shall be solid metal with two holes per slot
(both on the same side of the same slot), drilled and tapped to accept two
special sawtooth heat-treated plated steel fasteners 5/16 inch - 18UNC-2B for
securing the sign blades against removal from the slogs by vandalism and to
minimize fatigue failures in the sign blade resulting from wind vibration. The
side of each slot opposite the set screws shall be case or machined accurately
vertical to ensure that, when installed, the sign assembly will not appear to
be bent or askew.

(Ord. 94-09. Passed 4-20-94.)
1026.05   UNIFORM SYSTEM OF ADDRESSING ADOPTED; APPLICATION.
   A uniform system of developing and assigning addresses for premises is
hereby adopted. All premises addresses shall be determined through a
combination of a grid and frontage measurements. All addressable structures in
the County shall be identified by reference to the uniform numbering system
adopted by this section. This system shall be based on a grid system with local
adjustments consistent with a frontage system. The system shall apply County-
wide, except for areas within incorporated town limits. Such incorporated areas
may elect to participate in the County-wide addressing program and shall become
part thereof upon appropriate notice to the County.
(Ord. 92-01. Passed 1-21-92.)
1026.06   DETERMINATION OF ADDRESSES.
   The following procedures and processes are provided for the express purpose
of determining addresses for premises.
   (a)   Address Grid Map. The Address Grid Map of Loudoun County provides for
the establishment of unique primary addresses throughout the County by dividing
the County into address ranges, from 30000 to 48000 (west to east) and from
10000 to 27000 (north to south). Such numbering system is coincident with the
Virginia Coordinate Grid System, 1927 datum.
   (b)   Application of Grid to County. The Address Grid Map of Loudoun County
shall be applied to the Street Name Map of Loudoun County. The actual address
number range for each street segment shall be generated from the addressing
grid. Final interpretations of the address grid and application to the Street
Name Map rest with the Director.
   (c)   Uniform Assignment of Street Numbers. Street numbers shall be
uniformly assigned, with numbers increasing from north to south and west to
east as shown on the Street Name Map of Loudoun County. The directional
orientation of a street shall be determined by the Department. Numbers on the
north side of east-west streets shall be even, and numbers on the south side of
such streets shall be odd. Numbers on the east side of north-south streets
shall be even and numbers on the west side of such streets shall be odd.
   (d)   Uniform Increments/Decrements. All addresses of premises issued on a
given travelway shall increment/decrement uniformly. All reasonable effort
shall be made to have addresses uniformly increment/decrement with respect to
addresses on the opposite side of a street.
(Ord. 92-01. Passed 1-21-92.)
   (e)   Use of Access Points. Primary addresses shall be assigned to the
street from which the primary access originates. A premises address shall be
determined numerically from the address range for the named street segment
which the driveway serving the premises intersects. Whenever five or more
premises or potential premises (vacant lots) are involved with a private lane,
driveway or ingress/egress easement, except for single-owner private access
easements, a name shall be applied to such travelway as provided in
Chapter 1020, and all addressable structures accessing that main travelway
shall be addressed from such travelway.
(Ord. 94-09. Passed 4-20-94.)
   (f)   Premises with Multiple Access Points. An addressable structure shall
be addressed from the named travelway which provides primary access. Primary
access shall be determined as the all- weather access by the shortest practical
route.
   (g)   Corner Lots. The addressable structure on a corner lot shall be
addressed based on the street providing vehicular access (a driveway). When the
driveway intersects with more than one street, the Director shall have the
final determination of the most appropriate travelway on which to base an
address. The Director shall be guided by such factors as driveway distance and
the street name towards which the house faces.
   (h)   Commercial, Industrial, Institutional and Multifamily Buildings.
      (1)   Primary addresses.
         A.   Commercial, industrial and institutional structures shall carry
one unique primary address per addressable structure.
         B.   Each primary entrance of a multifamily residential structure
shall be assigned a unique street number (primary address).
         C.   The primary and secondary entrances to multifamily dwellings and
commercial, industrial and institutional buildings shall be clearly identified
on the address plat.
      (2)   Secondary addresses.
         A.   Individual units (businesses) within a commercial, industrial or
institutional structure shall be addressed using secondary unit numbers,
regardless of interior and exterior access points. The owner of an industrial,
commercial or institutional building shall be responsible for assignment of the
secondary addresses. Such assignment shall be made in accordance with this
chapter and within thirty days of a request from a tenant or before occupancy,
whichever comes first.
         B.   Secondary unit numbers shall consist of three digits. For multi-
story structures exceeding nine stories, four-digit numbers shall be assigned.
In cases where basements require secondary addresses, the three-digit number
shall begin with “0.” The two right-most digits shall represent the unit
number. The left-most digit shall represent the floor number (or the two left-
most digits for four-digit assignments).
         C.   For multifamily residential structures with units accessed
directly from the primary entrance and/or stairway from the primary entrance,
secondary numbering shall begin to the left side of the entrance-way and
proceed sequentially in a clockwise direction from the commencement point.
         D.   For units accessed by interior hallways (e.g., shopping malls),
secondary numbers shall be assigned with even numbers on the north and east
sides and odd numbers on the south and west sides of interior hallways. The
numbering sequence shall begin at the primary entrance.
            (Guidelines for determining secondary addresses in commercial,
industrial and institutional buildings and structures are contained in Appendix
I at the end of this chapter.)
(Ord. 92-01. Passed 1-21-92.)
         E.   For single-owner private access easements with more than one
addressable structure, secondary numbers shall be assigned sequentially using
every other number in accordance with Appendix III at the end of this chapter.
(Ord. 94-09. Passed 4-20-94.)
   (i)   Temporary Addresses. Temporary addresses shall be available only for
construction mobile home trailer offices and for similar purposes. Anyone
desiring a temporary address shall execute an agreement with the Department
that acknowledges that the address being provided is a temporary address to be
used for not more than one year from the date of issuance.
      To obtain a temporary address, the applicant shall provide a small area
map which contains the location of the temporary addressable structure, the
nature of the temporary addressable structure and the vehicular path by which
one can access the temporary addressable structure from the closest named
travelway.
(Ord. 92-01. Passed 1-21-92.)

grade surface (preferably eighteen inches) and no well casing shall terminate
in a pit, provided that this shall not apply to private wells where proper
topographical conditions exist so as to permit a four-inch gravity flow drain,
and where the pit walls and floor and ceiling are constructed so as to be
waterproof and preclude entrance of ground or surface water. Separate
structures which are constructed to house the water supply system and/or
pumping equipment shall have an impervious floor, raintight walls and roof and
adequate ventilation. The floors shall be six inches in thickness and shall be
sloped away from the well casing with a slope of not less than one inch in
eight feet. Where necessary, such structures shall be provided with an adequate
drain. The well terminus shall be sealed with a sanitary seal, gasketed and
protected from insects, or, if utilizing a pitless adaptor, shall use an
approved pitless adaptor and terminus cap.
   (b)   Specifications and Classes of Drilled Wells. All drilled wells shall
be cased and grouted in accordance with the following classifications. Grouting
shall conform to Section
1040.15. No work shall be considered completed in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter unless and until grouting is complete, and such
shall be done within ten days after setting of the casing.
      (1)   Class I wells shall be cased and grouted to solid rock with a
minimum casing and grout of 100 feet.
      (2)   Class II-A wells shall be cased to solid rock with a minimum casing

inch from the well to the edge of the concrete. This platform shall be at least
six inches thick.
      (2)   A collar of concrete at least six inches thick shall extend around
the outer wall of the casing and fill the annular space from the platform
downward at least six feet on existing wells. The concrete shall be poured with
a mix of one part Portland cement to two parts clean sand to three parts gravel
in one continuous operation from the predetermined depth to the ground surface.
      (3)   Where hand pumps are installed on shallow wells, the pump bed plate
shall be mounted on a concrete base that extends twelve inches above the
concrete platform. The pump bed plate shall rest upon a watertight gasket and
be bolted in place.
      (4)   If a power pump is used, a sanitary seal shall be fitted between
the sleeve and drop pipe.
      (5)    The water-bearing formation should be located at least twenty feet
below the ground surface and the outside of the casing should be pressure
grouted from a point one foot above the water-bearing formation to the ground
surface.
   (c)   Material Specifications. Casing or lining for bored or dug wells shall
be concrete, vitrified clay or other strong and durable material adequate to
maintain the opening and withstand the loads imposed, and all joints shall be
sealed to preclude entrance of ground water.
   (d)   Springs and Surface Water Systems. Springs and surface water supply
systems shall be protected and developed so as to prevent surface or ground
water contamination and shall provide such treatment as is required to maintain
a constant quality, safe for human consumption and/or domestic use. The owner
of any spring needing or requesting approval under this chapter must control
the use of the entire watershed upslope from the spring in fee simple or by
easement running with the land.

1040.15   GROUTING PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The annular space or any opening surrounding a well casing shall be
completely filled with neat Portland cement grout or with approved bentonite
clay/cement grout from an elevation above the established grade of the surface
at the well into a continuous impervious formation, or to a safe depth below
the probable present or future operating water level. The minimum width of the
annular space for grouting shall provide a clearance of at least one and one-
half inches. Grouting space shall be at least three inches larger than the
outside diameter of the casing.
   (b)   The annular space between the inner or protective casing and the outer
casing or hole shall be filled with cement or approved bentonite grout. Any
outer casing installed shall be removed during the grouting procedure unless
approved by the Health Director prior to the grouting procedure.
      (1)   Cement grout shall be proportioned of cement and the minimum

manufacturer's recommendations and in accordance with “Water Systems Handbook,
“ Water Systems Council.
      (4)   The well shall be vented at the well head to allow for pressure
changes within the well due to pumping. Well vents shall be positioned to
prevent the entrance of surface water, dust, insects or other foreign material.
      (5)   Upon completion of installation, the person installing the pump
(i.e. the well driller, pump installer or plumber) should disinfect the well,
pump and water supply system in accordance with Section
1040.15. The water supply system shall be disinfected in accordance with
Section
1040.16 immediately upon completion of construction.
   (d)   Observation Wells. The Health Director may specify special
construction standards for wells installed for the sole purpose of monitoring
water quality or water levels.
   (e)   Domestic Water Supply System Standard.
      (1)   A well or double well system shall produce at least one gallon per
minute.
      (2)   The water supply system shall produce not less than 500 gallons of
water in a two- hour period at least once each day.
      (3)   If the sustained yield of the well is not capable of meeting the
total water supply standard, sufficient storage shall be provided.
      (4)   Well storage shall conform to the following standards:
         A.   If well storage is selected, the amount of storage is calculated
by subtracting the well yield, as determined in paragraph (e)(2) hereof, over a
two-hour period, from 500 gallons.
         B.   The quantity of water in storage in the well is equal to the
number of feet between the unpumped static water level and the level of
drawdown as determined in the pump test, as provided in paragraph (f)(2)C.
hereof, multiplied by 1.5 gallons per foot for a six-inch well or 0.65 gallons
per foot for a four-inch well.
         C.   If a six-inch well produces a constant one gallon per minute, it
will produce 120 gallons in a two-hour period. Therefore, the well storage
shall provide 380 gallons (500 gallons - 120 gallons = 380 gallons). To provide
this quantity the well shall contain 253 feet of water in storage (380 gallons
- 1.5 gallons per foot = 253).
         D.   Table I has been provided to assist in determining the number of
feet of water required in well storage to meet the well water supply standard.
   (f)   Minimum Yield for Domestic Wells.
      (1)   Each well shall be tested and approved for yield in accordance with
paragraph (f) (2) hereof. Replacement wells servicing an existing improved
property are exempt from this requirement.
      (2)   All wells drilled with a yield determined to be less than five
gallons per minute, according to subsection (b) hereof, shall be tested as
follows:
         A.   The pump and related equipment shall be placed in the well and
the static water level measurement recorded.
         B.   Pumping shall begin at a rate of withdrawal greater than five
gallons per minute until the water level drops to a point close to the bottom
of the well.
         C.   When the water level reaches this point, the pump rate shall be
adjusted so that the water level remains constant (in effect, pumping out any
water which is flowing into the well).
         D.   The volume of water discharged (flow meter reading) and the water
level (with an electric tape) shall be measured and recorded at fifteen-minute
intervals throughout the test.
         E.   Water shall be discharged at least fifty feet from the well and
on-site disposal systems.
         F.   A single interruption of pumping of up to fifteen minutes due to
equipment failure or other unusual circumstances will be permitted, but the
amount of downtime shall be made up by additional pumping at the end of the
test.
      (3)   The criteria for approval shall be a minimum yield of one gallon
per minute for six hours of continuous pumping after the well has been pumped
out as provided in paragraph (f)(2)B. hereof.
      (4)   The pump test can be terminated early and the well yield will be
considered adequate if:
         A.   A well cannot be pumped out after three hours of pumping as
provided in paragraph (f)(2)B. hereof; and
         B.   A well yields an average of 2.5 gallons per minute or greater for
three hours of continuous pumping, after the well has been pumped out as
provided in paragraph (f)(2)B. hereof.
      (5)   The Health Director may permit two wells to be connected to meet
the minimum yield requirement. The well to be connected shall be tested in
accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (f)(2) hereof, and each
well shall demonstrate a yield of 0.5 gallons per minute or greater throughout
the entire uninterrupted drawdown phase.
      (6)   The person conducting the test shall collect a sample to be
analyzed for constituents described in Appendix III.

1042.03   COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS.
   No application shall be approved by the Board of Supervisors and no permit
shall be issued for the establishment of any new water system or for the
extension of any existing water system, and no work shall be done in connection
with any such new system or such extension, except in accordance with the
following standards and such other reasonable standards as may be applicable to
the particular application:
   (a)   Capacity to Serve.
      (1)   The proposed new system or the proposed extension for which a
permit is requested shall have sufficient supply and adequate capacity to
supply normal maximum demands of all customers, domestic, public, commercial
and industrial, maintaining a pressure of not less than thirty pounds per
square inch at all points of delivery, without reducing service to any other
customer below these requirements. In addition, the supply shall be adequate
and the system of sufficient capacity to deliver not less than the following
rates of flow for the following periods of time for fire protection, with a
residual pressure of not less than twenty pounds per square inch, to at least
one point within 500 feet of each building to be served or proposed to be
served by such new system or extension simultaneously with the calculated
maximum daily water demand:
 
Population of Community Required Fire Protection Flow Required Duration of Fire
Served                  (gal./min.)                   Flow (hrs.)
500 (or less)           250                           2
501 to 1,000            350                           2
1,001 to 2,000          450                           2
2,001 to 3,000          600                           3
 
      (2)   For communities with a population served in excess of 3,000, the
required fire flow in gallons per minute shall be 400 times the square root of
the population in thousands for a duration of three hours plus one hour for
each 1,000 population over 3,000, up to a maximum of ten hours.
      (3)   In considering an application for proposed new water systems and
proposed extensions of existing systems, the Board of Supervisors or its duly
authorized representative shall use the following criteria in estimating the
normal maximum water demands:
         A.   Residential population = N = number of dwelling units times 3.5;
         B.   Average daily water demand per residential population in gallons
per day (g.p.d.) = R;
            1.   For communities served by a public sewage system, R = N x 75;
or
            2.   For communities not served by a public sewage system, R = N x
55;
         C.   Average daily commercial and industrial water demand in g.p.d. =
C = number of commercial and industrial employees x 100*;
         D.   Allowance for loss and waste in g.p.d. = L = (R + C) x 0.10;
         E.   Average daily water demand in g.p.d. = A = R + C + L;
         F.   Maximum daily water demand in g.p.d. = M = A x 1.80;
         G.   Peak hour demand in g.p.d. = P = M x 1.50; and
         H.   Peak hour demand in gallons per minute (g.p.m.) = P + 1440.
   *Note: Appropriate additional water demand allowance will be made for
commercial and/or industrial establishments having high water demands and for
schools attended by appreciable numbers of students from outside the area
served by the water system under consideration.
      (4)   Capacity available to serve the aforesaid demands shall be
determined by one of the following methods:
         A.   The total capacity of all mechanical units less the largest or
most important unit which is assumed to be out of service for repair at the
time of maximum demand (not required of water systems serving less than 1,000
population); or
         B.   The total capacity of all mechanical units where reserve elevated
storage is provided in sufficient quantity to meet the aforesaid demands with
the largest or most important mechanical unit out of service for the time
required to repair or replace the unit (not applicable to water systems serving
more than 1,000 population).
            The total capacity of all mechanical units (wells, other sources of
supply or pumps) operating simultaneously shall be at least fifty percent more
than such demands, except that this requirement shall not be applicable to
water systems serving more than 5,000 population.
      (5)   Pumps, wells, other sources of supply and/or treatment facilities
shall have adequate available capacity, as defined in paragraph (a)(4) hereof,
to supply:
         A.   The maximum day rate plus the fire demand, or the peak hour rate,
whichever is greater where inadequate elevated storage is provided;
         B.   The maximum day rate plus the fire demand rate where elevated
storage equals or exceeds twenty percent of the maximum day demand for
equalization of demands; and
         C.   The maximum day rate only where elevated storage equals or
exceeds twenty percent of the maximum day demand plus 100 percent fire flow
requirement for the duration required.
   (b)   Quality of Water. All water furnished for domestic, commercial or
industrial consumption shall be of such quality as to meet all requirements of
the State Department of Health.
   (c)   Water Mains and Fittings. Mains and fittings of sixteen-inch inside
diameter (I.D.) or larger shall be of reinforced concrete water pipe, cement-
lined cast-iron water pipe or asbestos- cement water pipe. Mains and fittings
of six-inch I.D. and up to, but not including, sixteen-inch I.D. shall be of
cement-lined cast-iron water pipe or asbestos-cement water pipe. Mains and
fittings of less than six-inch I.D. shall be of cement-lined cast-iron water
pipe. All mains and fittings shall be designed to withstand a normal working
pressure of not less than 150 pounds per square inch and earth cover of at
least five feet and shall conform to the standard specifications of the
American Water Works Association. No main shall be less than six-inch I.D.
except in the case of dead-end streets or where it is used parallel to
transmission mains or larger distribution mains located within the same street
or right of way or connections between larger mains for furnishing domestic
service only, and in no case shall any water main be less than two and one-
fourth inch I.D. No water main serving one or more fire hydrants shall be less
than six-inch I.D.
      All dead-end water mains shall have adequate blow-off valves at the ends
thereof. Automatic air-relief valves shall be installed at the high points of
water mains where accumulation of air may interfere with the flow.
      All mains shall be laid at sufficient depth below the final finished
ground surface grade to give at least thirty inches of cover over the top of
the pipe.
      The horizontal distance between water mains and existing or projected
sewers shall be not less than ten feet, except where the water mains are
located at a higher elevation (one-foot minimum) than the top of the sewer, in
which case a minimum horizontal distance of six feet will be permissible.
   (d)   Valves. All valves shall conform to the standard specifications of the
American Water Works Association and shall open to the left. Valves shall be
installed at appropriate points in all water mains so as to permit the cutting
off of water from sections of reasonable length. Each valve shall be accessible
for operation with a standard valve key through an approved valve box extending
to the ground surface.
   (e)   Fire Hydrants. All fire hydrants shall conform to the American Water
Works Association standard specifications for fire hydrants for ordinary water
works service. Such hydrants shall have two two and one-half inch nozzles and
one four and one-half inch pumper nozzle with National Standard fire hose
coupling screw threads. Nozzle caps shall be provided for all outlets with
suitable gaskets to provide a tight seal with the nozzles. Such caps shall be
securely chained to the barrel of the hydrant. Cap nuts shall have the same
dimensions as the operating nut of the hydrant. The size of the main valve
opening of the hydrant shall be not less than four and one-half inches. The
hydrant shall connect to a six-inch branch pipe line in which is located an
isolating gate valve at least four feet from the hydrant.
      In new water systems serving subdivisions and in extensions of previously
approved water systems serving subdivisions, fire hydrants shall be installed
in such a manner that there will be at least one hydrant within 500 feet of the
center of the front property line of each lot served by such new system or by
such extension.
      In commercial and industrial areas, the spacing of fire hydrants shall be
such as to give adequate fire protection as determined by the nature, size and
spacing of buildings. In no case shall more than 600 feet of hose be required
to reach any point at the base of any exterior building wall from the nearest
fire hydrant.
   (f)   Installation of Water Mains, Fittings and Appurtenances. All
installations shall be made in accordance with the American Water Works
Association standard specifications for such installations and with any special
supplementary instructions issued by the manufacturers of the equipment being
installed.
   (g)   Testing of Water Mains. All water mains shall be tested under normal
operating water pressure and all leaks shall be stopped before being covered.

1060.01   PERMIT REQUIRED; PLANS.
   No new sewerage system to serve or to be capable of serving three or more
connections shall be established, and no extension of a previously approved
sewerage system shall be made, until a detailed plan of such proposed new
system or of such proposed extension, with proof of capacity to serve, has been
filed with, and a permit therefor has been obtained from, the Board of
Supervisors.
1060.02   APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   Application for a new system or for an extension, as described in Section
1060.01, shall be made in writing; shall state in detail the number, nature and
location of connections to be served (including dwelling units, schools and
other public buildings, and commercial and industrial establishments, together
with the probable number of employees of each such establishment); shall be
accompanied by scale drawings showing the location, size, material and extent
of the proposed sewerage system, including appurtenances, together with such
other pertinent information as the Board of Supervisors or its duly authorized
representative may require; and shall show in sufficient detail the manner in
which the applicant proposes to meet the standards set forth in Section
1060.04 et seq.
1060.03   COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS.
   No application shall be approved by the Board of Supervisors and no permit
shall be issued for the establishment of any new sewerage system or for the
extension of any existing sewerage system, and no work shall be done in
connection with any such new system or such extension, except in accordance
with the following standards and such other reasonable standards as may be
applicable to the particular application.
1060.04   GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Tributary Population.
      (1)   Sewerage systems which provide for a complete watershed shall be
designed and sized taking into consideration the estimated tributary population
for a period of fifty years hence. The entire watershed shall be assumed to be
completely built-up according to present or predicted zoning ordinances,
whichever requires the greater capacity.
      (2)   Sewerage systems which provide for only a part of a complete
watershed shall be sized to provide for the entire watershed. Otherwise,
provision shall be made for future increased capacity. Proper modification to
allow for the characteristics (i.e. domestic, commercial and industrial wastes
and ground water infiltration) of the area under consideration shall be made.
      (3)   Trunk and subtrunk sewers shall be designed on a basis of
population density of not less than ten persons per acre. Design provisions in
excess of this minimum shall be made where the engineer deems it necessary.
Supporting data shall be included in the design analysis. Design analyses shall
be provided for all trunk and subtrunk sewers and, when required by the County,
for collecting sewers.
   (b)   Capacities.
      (1)   In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the
following factors shall be considered:
         A.   The maximum hourly quantity of domestic sewage;
         B.   Additional maximum sewage or waste from industrial plants and
commercial areas; and
         C.   Ground water infiltration.
      (2)   New sewerage systems shall be designed on the basis of an average
per capita flow of sewage from the equivalent population served of not less
than 100 gallons per day. On this basis, lateral and submain sewers shall be
designed with capacities, when running full, in accordance with the peak flows
indicated in
Figure 1, entitled “Design Flow for Sewers When Average Flow: 100 Gal./Cap./
Day,” following this chapter.
      (3)   The 100 gallons per capita per day figure is assumed to cover
normal infiltration, but an additional allowance shall be made where conditions
are especially unfavorable. This figure is likewise considered sufficient to
cover the flow from cellar floor drains, but is not sufficient to provide an
allowance for flow from foundation drains, roof leaders or unpolluted cooling
water, which are prohibited by law from discharging into sanitary sewerage
systems. See
Chapter 1064.
      (4)   Unless evidence is presented to prove a different flow from
industry at ultimate development, the minimum allowance for industrial flow
shall be determined by providing an equivalent population of forty persons per
acre or one equivalent population per employee, whichever is greater, in the
industrial area. The area includes the entire area zoned for industry, except
public road, street and highway rights of way, flood plains on which
construction is prohibited and “green zones” separating industrial from
residential areas, on which construction is prohibited.
      (5)   The minimum allowance for flows from commercial areas shall be
determined by providing an equivalent population of thirty persons per acre, or
one-half the equivalent population per employee, whichever is greater, in the
commercial area. The area includes the entire area zoned for commercial
development, including off-street parking areas and landscaped areas, but
excludes the rights of way of public roads, streets and highways, flood plains
of streams on which construction is prohibited and “green zones,” 100 feet or
more in width, separating commercial from residential areas, on which
construction is prohibited.
      (6)   In cases where the above criteria are not applicable, an alternate
design procedure may be submitted to the County for approval. A description of
the procedure used and justification for the modifications for the proposed
sewer design shall be included with the design analyses and plans submitted for
approval.
   (c)   Sewer Locations. In general, sewers shall be located on legally
established streets or rights of way and shall be equidistant from property
lines or curb lines wherever possible. The horizontal distance between sewers
and existing or projected water mains shall be not less than ten feet, except
where the water mains are located at a higher elevation (a minimum of one and
one-half feet above the top of the sewer) than the top of the sewer, in which
case a minimum horizontal distance of six feet will be permissible.
   (d)   Manholes.
      (1)   Manholes for access to sewers shall be provided at all
intersections with other sewers, at all points of change in alignment, at all
changes in grade and at the terminal of the line. In addition, access manholes
shall be provided at intervals not exceeding 400 feet on all sewers fifteen
inches in diameter or less and not more than 500 feet apart on sewers eighteen
inches in diameter or larger.
      (2)   Sewer manholes for sewers up to twenty-four inches in diameter
shall be not less than four feet in inside diameter. Manholes for sewers larger
than twenty-four inches and up to forty-eight inches shall have an inside
diameter of not less than five feet.
      (3)   Manholes shall have eight-inch walls constructed of brick or block
and shall be parged inside and outside with one-half inch cement mortar or
shall be of precast concrete construction equivalent to or greater than that
specified in A.S.T.M. C 478, the latest revision, and having gasket material in
accordance with specification A.S.T.M. 361, the latest revision.
      (4)   Manhole frames and covers shall be gray cast iron and shall be
designed for roadway traffic. The word “sewer” shall be cast in the cover.
      (5)   Manhole bases shall be of Class A reinforced concrete and shall be
a minimum of nine inches thick.
   (e)   Minimum Sewer Size. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in
diameter.
   (f)   Sewer Connections. Connections to sewer lines eighteen inches in
diameter or larger shall be made only at manholes.
   (g)   Hydraulic Design Criteria. The hydraulic design and determination of
sewer sizes shall be based on the following conditions:
      (1)   Sewers shall have a uniform slope and straight alignment between
manholes.
      (2)   At all junctions where a sewer of smaller diameter discharges into
a larger one and at all locations where the sewer increases in size, the invert
of the larger sewer shall be lowered so that the energy gradient of the sewer
at the junction is at the same level. Generally, this condition will be met by
placing the crowns of the two sewers at the same elevation.
      (3)   Sewers shall be designed to be free flowing with the hydraulic
grade below the crown and with hydraulic slopes sufficient to provide an
average velocity, when running full, of not less than 2.25 feet per second
(f.p.s.). Computations of velocity of flow shall be based on the following
values of “n,” as used in the Kutter or Manning formula for velocity of flow.
For pipe sizes eight to twenty-four inches in diameter, laid in lengths up to
five feet, “n” equals 0.013. For pipe sizes eight to twenty-seven inches in
diameter, laid in lengths of six feet or longer, “n” equals 0.012. For pipe
sizes thirty inches in diameter and up, laid in lengths of four feet or more
with tongue and groove-type joints carefully made smooth, “n” equals 0.012.
      (4)   For sewage flow depth less than one-fourth full, allowance shall be
made for increased value of “n” and in no case shall velocities of less than
1.3 f.p.s. be permitted. The improved velocities shall be accomplished by
steeper grades and not by increasing the pipe diameter.
      (5)   The maximum permissible velocity at average flow (before applying
the peak flow factor) shall be fifteen f.p.s. Suitable drop manholes shall be
provided to break the steep slopes in order to limit the velocities in the
connecting sewer pipes between manholes. Where drop manholes are impractical
for the reduction of velocity, the sewer shall be of cast iron or other
abrasion-resistant material.
   (h)   Structural Design. The structural design of sewers shall conform with
the methods given in the A.S.C.E. Manual No. 37 for the “Design and
Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers.” Sewers installed in streets shall
generally have a minimum cover of six feet.
   (i)   Pipe Materials. The County reserves the right to select the type of
material used in sewer installation from the following list of materials:
      (1)   Asbestos cement pipe. Asbestos cement sewer pipe shall be in
conformity with A.S.T.M. Designation C428, the latest revision, and must also
be autoclave cured in a manner to eliminate all free lime.
      (2)   Clay pipe. Vitrified clay pipe shall be in conformity with A.S.T.M.
Designation C13, the latest revision, for standard strength clay sewer pipe, or
A.S.T.M. Designation C200, the latest revision, for extra strength clay sewer
pipe. All joints shall conform to A.S.T.M. Designation C425, the latest
revision.
      (3)   Reinforced concrete pipe. Reinforced concrete sewer pipe shall be
in conformity with A.S.T.M. Designation C76, the latest revision, for Class II,
Class III, Class IV or Class V with the exception that absorption shall be
limited to five percent. All joints shall be of the “O” ring type.
      (4)   Cast iron pipe. Cast iron pipe used for sewer installation shall be
in conformity with American Standard Specifications for Cast Iron Pipe for
Water (A.S.A. A-21.2, A-21.6 and A-21.8). Wall thickness shall be computed
according to A.W.W.A. Manual C101. No cast iron soil pipe shall be used as a
public sewer, but such pipe may be used for building sewers as required by
Chapter 1064. (Adopting Ordinance)
1060.05   CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Excavations.
      (1)   Generally. During the excavation operations, material suitable for
backfilling shall be piled in an orderly manner at a sufficient distance from
the banks of the trench to avoid overloading and to prevent slides or cave-ins.
All excavated material not suitable and/or required for backfill shall be
removed and disposed of in an approved manner. Such grading shall be done as
may be necessary to prevent water from flowing into trenches or other
excavations, and any water accumulating therein shall be removed by approved
methods. All excavations shall be made by open cut unless otherwise specified.
      (2)   Trench excavations. The trench shall not be opened for a distance
exceeding 300 feet at any time when located along streets or highways. The
width of the trench at any point below the top of the pipe shall not exceed the
structural design assumption width. The width of the trench above the top of
the pipe may be as wide as necessary for sheeting and bracing and the proper
performance of the work. All trench walls shall be kept as nearly vertical as
possible. Excavation at manholes and similar structures shall be sufficient to
leave at least twelve inches clear between their outer surface and the
embankment or sheeting. Minimum clearance between the sides of the trench and
pipe shall be eight inches.
      (3)   Rock excavations. In rock, the minimum width of the trench shall be
the outside diameter of the pipe plus twelve inches, and there shall be a
minimum of six inches of sidewall clearance between the pipe and rock at all
points. The maximum width of the trench at any point below the top of the pipe
shall not exceed the structural design assumption width. The rock shall be
excavated to a minimum overdepth of ten inches, or as required for class of
bedding, whichever is greater, below the outside bottom of the pipe. Before
laying pipe in rock trenches, the trench shall be refilled with suitable
material of an approved quality, thoroughly consolidated, up to the proper
elevation to provide a foundation as required in subsection (b) hereof for
laying the pipe.
   (b)   Pipe Foundations.
      (1)   Pipe installed in trenches. Pipe to be located at elevations below
the existing ground level shall be installed in trenches with Class A, B or C
pipe bedding as shown in Figure II following this chapter. Granular material
under and around the pipe shall be placed in six-inch layers and compacted by
rodding, spading or with approved vibratory equipment to obtain not less than
eighty percent relative density as determined by A.S.T.M. Method D2049.
      (2)   Pipe installed in embankment. Pipe to be located at elevations
above the existing ground level shall be installed in trenches excavated after
embankment has been constructed to a minimum elevation of one foot above the
proposed top of the pipe.
      (3)   Pipe bedding material. The pipe shall be bedded from the trench
subgrade to the pipe springline in granular material consisting of gravel,
crushed gravel or crushed stone meeting the requirements of A. S. T. M.
Designation C33, Gradation 67 (three-quarter inch to No. 4).
      (4)   Foundation in poor soil. Whenever the soil at the bottom of the
trench is soft, unstable or saturated with water, a granular fill shall be
provided under the pipe to a depth required to stabilize the soil. The maximum
size of gravel shall be two inches. A concrete cradle shall be provided when
necessary to bridge highly unstable soils.
   (c)   Backfill.
      (1)   Material. All material used for backfilling of trenches shall be
free of excessive amounts of deleterious materials such as all organic matter,
frozen clods and sticky masses of clay and gumbo which are difficult to
properly compact. No rock material used for backfill shall be longer than four
inches in its greatest dimension or be placed within twelve inches of the
installed pipe in any direction, including under, around and on top of the
pipe. The pipe shall be embedded in a good quality earth or granular material
such as crushed rock or pea gravel.
      (2)   Height of layers. Backfill shall be placed in six-inch layers from
the bottom of the trench to a point at least twelve inches above the top of the
pipe and thoroughly tamped by hand or pneumatic tampers. Above this point,
backfill shall be deposited in layers of a thickness which will permit
compaction to a density specified in paragraph (c)(3) hereof.
      (3)   Compaction of layers. The layers of material shall be compacted to
a density of at least ninety-five percent of the maximum density at optimum
moisture content as determined by the AASHO Standard Test (AASHO Designation
T99) under all pavements and for future pavements. Pavement shall not be
restored over trenches until the backfill material has been tested and
determined to be satisfactory according to the tests.
   (d)   Safety of Public.
      (1)   Maintenance of traffic. Construction operations shall be scheduled
so as to interfere as little as possible with public travel, whether vehicular
or pedestrian. Whenever it is necessary to cross or interfere with roads,
driveways and walks, whether public or private, suitable and safe bridges,
detours or other temporary expedients for the accommodation of public and
private travel shall be provided and maintained. Reasonable notice shall be

inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (e)   Sheeting and Bracing. All trenches and excavations shall be properly
sheeted and braced for the safety of personnel and the protection of the work,
to maintain the maximum trench widths permitted and/or to prevent the
disturbance or settlement of adjacent foundations or structures.
   (f)   Construction on State Highways and Streets. The State Department of
Highways and Transportation requires a permit for work to be performed on State
highways. Provisions for obtaining such permits are set forth in the “Manual on
Permits, Virginia Department of Highways, Richmond, Virginia,” the latest
revision. No work shall be approved by the County that has not been accepted or
approved as satisfactory by the State Department of Highways.
   (g)   Restoration.
      (1)   The County shall not approve any construction wherein public or
private property has not been restored to a condition at least equal to its
condition before commencement of construction.

with a mirror. If the illuminated interior of the pipe shows poor alignment,
displaced pipe or any other defect, the defect shall be remedied.
      (3)   All completed sewers shall be tested for leakage by exfiltration
(i.e. outward leakage, trench dry) or infiltration (i.e. inward leakage, trench
wet). Leakage shall not exceed 200 gallons per inch of diameter of sewer per
mile per day up to a twenty-four inch diameter. Leakage may be allowed up to
400 gallons per inch of diameter per mile per day for short sections of sewer
lines (between two adjacent manholes) up to and including a twelve-inch
diameter. However, the average leakage on the system being tested for
acceptance shall not exceed the 200-inch gallon standard.
      (4)   For sewers larger than twenty-four inches in diameter, leakage
shall not exceed 5,000 gallons per mile per day.
   (i)   Blasting. Blasting, where required, shall be done with care in
accordance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, ordinances and

approved method of disposal of sewage shall misuse or neglect such a system or
any part thereof so as to cause it to cease functioning as designed in a
sanitary manner. The issuance of a permit, subsequent installation and
acceptance of the onsite sewage treatment system upon inspection by the Health
Department does not denote or imply any guarantee of operation of such system,
and it shall be the responsibility of the owner, or any subsequent owner of the
system, to maintain, repair or replace any system which has ceased to function
as designed in a sanitary manner.
   (b)   Except as provided herein, for all individual sewage disposal systems
not requiring a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) permit,
the owner shall cause a maintenance pump-out of the septic tank of each such
system to be performed by a septic tank cleaner licensed by the Loudoun County
Health Department at least once every 5 years and shall provide documentation
of the subject maintenance at the request of the County. Licensed septic tank
cleaners shall report all pump-outs in a manner acceptable to the Loudoun
County Health Department by the 15th of the following month and shall provide
the homeowner with a copy of the information reported. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for Alternative Onsite Sewage Systems (AOSSs), in lieu of the
required 5-year pump-out, the owner may submit documentation annually,
certified by an individual who is licensed or certified under Chapter 23 (§
54.1-2300 et seq.) of Title 54.1 of the Code of Virginia as being qualified to
operate, monitor, and maintain an AOSS, that the system has been inspected, is
functioning properly, and the tank does not need to be pumped out. For
conventional systems, the owner may submit documentation certified by an
individual who is licensed or certified under Chapter 23 (§ 54.1-2300 et seq.)
of Title 54.1 of the Code of Virginia as being qualified to operate, monitor,
and maintain an AOSS or conventional system, that the tank has been inspected,
is functioning properly, and the tank does not need to be pumped out for at
least the next two (2) years. This documentation, including sludge and scum
accumulation depths, must be submitted every two (2) years after the initial
five (5)-year report until the tank is pumped. Once the tank is pumped, the
five (5) year pump-out cycle is re-initiated with the inspection in lieu of
pump-out option as stated herein.

described in subsection (g) hereof. Evaluations shall indicate whether or not
the soils meet the criteria specified herein for the installation of the type
of on-site sewage treatment system proposed. In addition to information
gathered during the soils and geotechnical investigation, the topography,
available area, proximity to ground and drinking water supplies, proximity to
bodies of water, rates of water absorption by the soil horizon proposed for
use, or a combination of any of the above, shall also be considered in such
evaluation. If absorption rate problems are suspected, percolation tests or
other infiltration tests may be required, but their results shall not be
presumptive, prima-facie or conclusive evidence as to the suitability for
effluent absorption. Soil reports shall be field reviewed by the Health
Department unless administratively denied or deemed approved. Backhoes are
required for Health Department soil/site evaluations and verifications of
private sector submitted soil/site evaluations unless waived by the Health
Department.
   (d)   Plot and Structure Identification. A plot, prepared by the applicant,
is to accompany all applications for permits to construct on-site sewage
treatment systems and must show accurately:
         (1)   The dimensions of the property.
         (2)   Proposed and/or existing structures and driveways.
         (3)   Underground utilities.
         (4)   Adjacent sewage treatment systems.
         (5)   Bodies of water.
         (6)   Drainageways and floodplains.
         (7)   Wells and springs within a 200-foot radius of the edge of the
proposed onsite sewage treatment system.
   (e)   Physical Features.
      (1)   Pad and trench soil absorption systems shall not be placed on
slopes greater than twenty-five percent.
      (2)   Placement of subsurface soil absorption systems in disturbed soil
is prohibited.
      (3)   Outside of the Limestone Overlay District no onsite sewage
treatment system shall be placed closer than 100 feet from the low point of a
sinkhole nor closer than fifty feet from the outer edge of a sinkhole.
Sinkholes will be considered to exist with or without knowledge of the size,
orientation or presence of subterranean voids, since the surface collapse
evidences subsidence into such a void. Distances from rock outcrops may be
imposed and additional geologic information required in accordance with a
geotechnical report, as described in Section 6.150 of the Loudoun County
Facilities Standards Manual, where limestone or other environmentally critical
rock formations are encountered.
      (4)   Within the Limestone Overlay District no onsite sewage treatment
system shall be placed closer than 100 feet from the rim of a sinkhole/swallet/
closed depression, from a cave opening, or from a perennial sinking stream. Nor
shall an onsite sewage treatment system be placed closer than fifty feet from a
rock outcrop, or underground solution channel within 45 feet of the surface.
Such setback may be reduced by up to fifty percent if a geophysical study, as
required by Section 4-1905 of the Revised 1993 Zoning Ordinance, as amended,
conducted in accord with Section 6.151 of the Facilities Standards Manual,
concludes that the risks of collapse and groundwater contamination are non-
existent or insignificant for the proposed location and use. No setback
reduction shall be allowed for any perennial sinking stream, nor for any
sinkhole, swallet, closed depression or cave opening that receives an
intermittent or perennial sinking stream. No onsite sewage treatment system
shall be placed closer than: (1) one hundred (100) feet from a developed
spring, measured from the first emergence of the spring or (2) two hundred
(200) feet from a developed spring when the first emergence of the spring is
downslope from the proposed sewage disposal system. However, for a lot of
record existing on February 17, 2010, an onsite sewage treatment system for a
principal residential structure may be permitted within the setback if it is
constructed in compliance with all recommendations of the geophysical study and
such system is sited on the lot so as to be located as far from the feature as
is feasible. No such onsite sewage treatment system shall be allowed if the
geophysical study shows subsidence or groundwater contamination poses a serious
risk to public health or safety or to the safety of residents or users of the
residential structure unless the design of the system is certified, both
structurally and geotechnically, by a professional engineer.
   (f)   Soil Profiles.
      (1)   Depth of profile hole. The minimum depth of the profile hole shall
be six feet, or deep enough to verify all stand offs unless prevented or made
unnecessary by some physical feature of the soil, such as redoximorphic
features, rock or when a potential horizon is found at a lesser depth. When a
potential soil horizon is considered for use, the soil evaluation shall be
extended below the soil horizon, with potential for use, to insure that there
is no interference with seasonal water tables, lithic rock, paralithic rock or
other impervious strata within the vertical offset limitation.
      (2)   Number and location of profile holes. A minimum of five holes is
necessary to determine the design requirements of an area for the placement of
any soil absorption area. Holes shall be evenly placed to bound the area under
consideration with one hole installed in the center. If more than one area is
required in which to install the soil absorption area, each area shall be
evaluated with at least three soil borings. The actual area and number of
borings necessary shall be determined on a case-by-case basis.
   (g)   Requirements for a detailed soil/site evaluation. Detailed soil-site
evaluation reports generated for any proposed on-site sewage treatment system
are required by and are to be submitted to the Health Department. A detailed
investigation may also be required by the Health Director for specialized land
use applications such as solid waste operations, composting facilities or other
similar uses.
   The detailed soil/site evaluation report should include the following, where
appropriate, unless determined by the Health Director, at the request of the
developer, to be inapplicable based upon sound engineering principals:
      (1)   Results of field investigation.
         A.   A map, drawn to 1:2,400 scale (1 inch = 200 feet) and larger, as
requested on a sheet twenty-four inches by thirty-six inches. Where small
tracts are involved, an eight by eleven-inch sheet may be acceptable, provided
it complies with all other requirements set forth herein.
         B.   Existing water supplies within 100 feet of the property and 200
feet of sewage treatment systems on the property.
         C.   The location of all borings and backhoe pits. Test holes/pits are
to be numbered and located dimensionally, including surface elevations.
         D.   The location of all numbered proposed on-site soil absorption
areas, if applicable. All soil absorption areas must be shown on contour and
delineated by five borings or pits. In addition, site locations within the
Limestone Overlay District and those underlaid by limestone/limestone
conglomerate, shall be examined in cross section to a depth of 45 feet minimum,
using technology such as electrical resistivity, to determine the presence of
karst features. Karst features, such as voids and solution channels, may be
grounds for denial of the site.
         E.   The following items as they relate to the proposal, if required:
            1.   The landscape type and position, the slope, topography and the
surface drainage.
            2.   The soil morphology, including the texture, color, structure,
consistency, depth, lithologic discontinuities, boundaries, etc.
            3.   The permeability, internal drainage and perched water tables.
            4.   The parent material and associated problems.
            5.   Restrictive strata.
         F.   The soil evaluation form.
      (2)   The following items shall be required in the report when soil
absorption areas are proposed:
         A.   Depth of installation, type of system, relative suitability and
modifications.
         B.   Recommendations and conclusions for repairing existing
malfunctioning on-site sewage treatment systems.
         C.   Potential impacts on ground and surface water.

observed (or if indicated by soil color patterns).
         E.   The name of the person responsible for the description and
sampling.
      (4)   Field testing. If field tests, such as percolation tests or other
permeability tests, have been conducted, the results shall be included.
         A.   Percolation tests.
         B.   Permeability tests, including a description of the profile.
         C.   Piezometer observations, including readings, depth, date of
readings, rainfall data and soil profile (if available for the site).

1066.12   DESIGN AND LOCATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ONSITE SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEMS.
   (a)   Design.
      (1)   Distance to rock. The minimum acceptable separation distance, both
vertical and horizontal, from the absorption trench bottom and sidewalls to
lithic rock, rock outcroppings, Cr horizons and pans, is 12 inches. However, in
the limestone overlay district, horizontal and vertical separation between
limestone lithic rock and trench bottoms and sidewalls is 48 inches for septic
tank effluent, 36 inches for TL-2 effluent and 24 inches for TL-3 effluent with
ultraviolet or other approved standard disinfection.
      (2)   Depth to seasonal water table. The minimum separation distance from
the absorption trench bottom or point of effluent release to the seasonal water
table is 24 inches for septic tank effluent, 18 inches for TL-2 effluent, and
12 inches for TL-3 effluent with ultraviolet or other approved standard
disinfection.
      (3)   Blasting of lithic rock prohibited. The use of explosive materials
for the purpose of removing lithic rock within 100 feet of the soil absorption
area or within fifty feet of any remaining portion of the sewage conveyance,
treatment or dosing system in the limestone overlay district is specifically
prohibited. Lithic rock encountered in the soil absorption area during
installation at any location will necessitate a redesign of the system
permitted and will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
      (4)   Size. The size of the soil absorption area based on the square
footage of the trench bottoms shall consist of a minimum of 600 square feet.
Drip and spray or other surface square footage designed systems shall have a
minimum square footage of 1800 sq. ft.
      (5)   Driveways and parking areas. Driveways and parking areas shall be a
minimum of 5 feet from onsite sewage treatment systems except for sewer and
conveyance lines crossing the area and soil absorption areas designed to be
placed under paved surfaces.
      (6)   Minimum location requirements. Minimum location requirements as set
forth in Appendix I, following this chapter shall be met.
   (b)   Off Site Easements. Where an onsite sewage treatment system is located
by easement off the lot of the structure it serves, the Health Director shall
establish special design and performance standards, procedures and forms
necessary to ensure identification, protection and maintenance of the onsite
sewage treatment system to be located on that easement.
   The onsite sewage treatment system shall be located on the lot, tract or
parcel of land which it serves. However, onsite sewage treatment systems on
off-site easements may be permitted in the following situations:
         (1)   A permit was issued for the onsite sewage treatment system prior
to January 17, 1989.
         (2)   The onsite sewage treatment system is proposed to replace a
failing onsite sewage treatment system.
         (3)   The lot was shown to be served by the off-site easement on a
preliminary plan of subdivision approved prior to January 17, 1989.
         (4)   The lot was shown on a preliminary plan of subdivision or plan
of family subdivision accepted for review by the Department of Planning, Zoning
and Community Development prior to January 17, 1989.
         (5)   The onsite sewage treatment system is proposed to serve an
existing lot of record as of January 17, 1989, for which no approved on-site
sewage treatment system approvable for a minimum design of 450 gallons per day
can be found.
         (6)   Onsite sewage treatment systems may be situated on permanent,
dedicated open space, but only where specifically permitted by the Subdivision
Regulations and the Zoning Ordinance of the County.
         (7)   Multiple existing structures on any parcel currently served by
on- site sewage treatment systems may use easements for onsite sewage treatment
systems if a division of that parcel cannot be reasonably accomplished without
the use of easements.
   (c)   Reserve Absorption Area Sites. Sufficient suitable soils shall be
available on each lot, or available to each lot by easement or other device
approved by the Health Department, to allow repair and/or extension of the on-
site sewage treatment system for a period of time equal to:
         (1)   The reasonably anticipated life expectancy of the structure
(interpreted as 100 percent repair area); or
         (2)   In an area designated by an adopted area plan for future central
sewer service by Loudoun Water or an incorporated town, the planned
availability date of that sewer service or fifty percent of the originally
required soil area, whichever is greater.
   Soil absorption areas are considered, for purposes of this section, to have
a life expectancy of thirty years. Lots proposed for approval in these areas
shall contain sewer utility easements designed to facilitate future sewer line
construction and installation. Design consultation with Loudoun Water or other
local sewage authorities is required prior to Health Department approval.
   (d)   Site Preparation and Alteration.
         (1)   Removal of vegetation. Vegetation, such as maples, willows and
other plant species with extremely hydrophilic (water loving) root systems,
shall be removed at least ten feet from the actual absorption areas. All trees
should be removed from the absorption area. The local agent of the Virginia
Department of Forestry will arbitrate any dispute as to the hydrophilic nature
of any tree or shrub.
         (2)   Placement of utilities. Subsurface soil absorption systems shall
not be placed in an underground utility easement. No buried utility services,
water lines, electrical lines, gas lines, etc., shall traverse the subsurface
soil absorption system area, nor shall the buried service be closer than ten
feet to the system.

1066.13   PRIVIES AND PORTABLE TOILETS.
   No person shall erect, install or allow to be erected or installed a pit
privy except to repair or replace an existing pit privy. A permit for such is
required from the Health Department.
   (a)   Portable Toilets. Portable toilets may be used for temporary uses such
as construction sites, special events, and emergencies. They may not be used to
facilitate new development or expansions of existing facilities or as a
permanent means of sewage disposal. The tank shall be cleaned at least once
weekly or more often as necessary to prevent the contents from filling the tank
above two-thirds of its capacity. Cleaning of the tank shall be done by a
licensed septic tank cleaner with approved equipment as required in Section
1066.04(b). Chemicals approved by the Health Department shall be added as often
as necessary to liquefy wastes and prevent objectionable odors. Daily washing
of the toilet seat and the inside of the building shall be required. Toilet
tissue and hand sanitizer shall be provided at all times. The privy shall be
maintained in such a way that it will not endanger public health or create a
nuisance.
   (b)   Vault Privy Use. Vault privies may be used for a specified period of
time at a specific location as prescribed by the Health Department on a case by
case basis.
      (1)   Building; vents and door. A building must be used which may be on
skids for movability, so constructed as to be fly tight and rodent proof, with
vents near the ceiling covered with sixteen mesh copper wire screen, or
equivalent, and with a self-closing, fly tight door.
      (2)   Seat box, hole and vent. The seat and seat box shall be constructed
to be easily cleanable and to cover completely the opening of a corrosion-
resistant, waterproof, tank of sufficient capacity. The tank shall have an
opening directly under the seat hole. Where necessary, an approved sleeve shall
be provided between the seat and the tank. The tank shall be vented through the
roof with a sixteen mesh screen or other approved covering.
      (3)   Maintenance. The tank shall be cleaned out at least once weekly or
more often as necessary to prevent the contents from filling the tank above
two-thirds of its capacity. Cleaning of the tank shall be done by a licensed
septic tank cleaner with approved equipment as required in Section
1066.04 (b). Daily washing of the toilet seat and the inside of the building
shall be required. Toilet tissue and hand sanitizer shall be provided at all
times. The privy shall be maintained in such a way that it will not endanger
the public health or create a nuisance.
(Ord. 94-05. Passed 2-16-94; Ord. 17-03. Passed 1-19-17.)
1066.14   EXISTING SYSTEM REUSE AND ABANDONMENT.
   Existing systems being reused for a new purpose (also known as: change of
use, or safe adequate and proper evaluations) may be approved on a case by case
basis provided they received previous Health Department approval. A
comprehensive evaluation is required, and all components must be in good repair
prior to use. Systems may not be used for increased flow or higher strength
waste than specified in the original design unless an application and
approvable redesign is submitted prior to permit issuance. Systems that are
disused, or serving structures to be connected to public sewer are to be
abandoned according to procedures approved by the Health Department.
(Ord. 17-03. Passed 1-19-17.)
1066.15   COMMUNITY SYSTEMS.
   Reserved.
(Ord. 17-03. Passed 1-19-17.)
1066.16   SEPTIC TANKS, HOLDING TANKS, PUMP TANKS, TREATMENT UNITS AND TANKS
FOR OTHER ONSITE WASTEWATER USES.
   (a)   Depth and size. The maximum cover over a tank containing wastewater
shall not exceed 48 inches. In no case shall septic tank capacity be less than
750 gallons.
   (b)   Location. Tanks shall not be placed in concave areas or drainage ways.
Tanks shall be protected with controlled backfill when shrink-swell soil or
rock is present. If water table indications are observed or measured above
penetrations or tank seams, a water table reduction system must be installed to
lower the water table below the seam or penetration.
   (c)   Structural Soundness. Tanks shall be structurally sound as determined
by an engineer design with appropriate safety factors, and watertight verified
through appropriate testing and compliance monitored by the Health Department.
All tanks shall be designed and certified by a professional engineer, licensed
and qualified to perform structural design in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The
engineer shall contemplate all reasonably expected loading conditions,
including burial depth, tank full to top of riser, an empty tank installed with
water table at top of ground, vehicular traffic and any other reasonable
expected loading conditions. The manufacturer shall certify that all tanks
manufactured meet the engineer design. Tanks may only be installed in
accordance with the design standards specified.
   (d)   Buoyancy. Septic tanks and pump chambers shall implement buoyancy
controls where seasonal water table is a concern.
   (e)   Penetrations. All tank lids shall be manufactured with the first
section of risers pre-cast into the top of the tank. Risers shall terminate a
maximum of six inches below finished grade. Manufacturers shall install
watertight boots at all penetrations. Boots for all tanks must meet ASTM C-923.
Boots for concrete tanks must meet ASTM C-923 and have a clamp assembly to
resist pipe deformation.
   (f)   Tank Testing. All tanks shall be watertight, including inlet and
outlet pipe penetrations, and the riser assembly. The installer shall, on all
watertight tanks, complete one of the following tests during, or in conjunction
with a Health Department or other approved construction inspection. In high
water table conditions the Health Director is authorized to require a water
tightness test of the entire treatment and conveyance system.
      (1)   Water test procedure. A water test is to be performed by installing
the tank, connecting inlet and outlet piping, installing risers as necessary,
and filling with water above tank top outer surface into the riser for 24
hours. The tank penetrations and seams must be visible. The water level is to
be marked in the riser. The tank is to be refilled to the mark and observed for
one hour. If the level has not dropped the tank passes.
      (2)   Vacuum test procedure. A vacuum test is performed by plugging inlet
and outlet piping, installing risers, and using a vacuum pump to pull a
negative pressure of two and one half (2.5) inches of mercury. The tank must
hold this vacuum for five minutes with no more than a 10% variation in
pressure.
         If tanks fail either test, repairs must be completed using
manufacturer approved materials and the test repeated until satisfactory.

(Ord. 17-01. Passed 1-19-17.)
1066.20   WAIVERS.
   The Director may grant a waiver of certain requirements of this Ordinance,
as set forth below, if a thorough investigation by the Director reveals (i)
that compliance with such requirement would cause a clearly demonstrable
hardship (including, without limitation, an economic hardship) to the property
owner that outweighs the benefits that may result to the public from requiring
such compliance, and (ii) that the granting of such waiver shall not subject
the public to unreasonable risk to public health. Any building: 1) located
within and considered by the Zoning Administrator, or designee, to be a
contributing resource to a County Historic Site (HS) District or Historic and
Cultural Conservation (HCC) District under Section 6-1800 et seq. of the
Revised 1993 Zoning Ordinance, as amended; or 2) listed or eligible for listing
in the Virginia Landmarks Register (VLR) or the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP); or 3) listed or eligible for listing as a contributing resource
to a VLR or NRHP listed or eligible Historic District, shall comply with this
ordinance to the greatest extent possible but shall be granted a waiver to
requirements of this ordinance to the extent that the Director determines
compliance cannot be obtained. The Health Department shall have a written
policy approved by the Loudoun County Administrator detailing the
administration of waivers. Upon petition by the property owner the Health
Director has authority to grant waivers to the following Sections of this

elimination of pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant
properties in wastewater prior to, or in lieu of, introducing such pollutants
into the POTW. This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical,
chemical, or biological processes; by process changes; or by other means,
except by diluting the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an
applicable Pretreatment Standard.
      (34)   "Pretreatment Requirements." Any substantive or procedural
requirement related to pretreatment imposed on a User, other than a

wastestream; or
            3.   Is designated as such by the Sanitation Authority on the basis
that it has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW system's
operation or for violating any Pretreatment Standard or Requirement.
         C.   The County or Sanitation Authority may determine that an
Industrial User subject to categorical Pretreatment Standards is a Non-
Significant Categorical Industrial User rather than a Significant Industrial
User on a finding that the Industrial User never discharges more than 100
gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-
contact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in
the Pretreatment Standard) and the following conditions are met:
            1.   The Industrial User, prior to County or Sanitation Authority
finding, has consistently complied with all applicable categorical Pretreatment

operation or for violating any Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the County
or Sanitation Authority may at any time, on its own initiative or in response
to a petition received from an Industrial User, and in accordance with
procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that such User should not be
considered a Significant Industrial User.
      (43)   "Slug Load" or "Slug Discharge." Any discharge at a flow rate or
concentration, which could cause a violation of the prohibited discharge
standards in Section
1068.02 (b) of this Chapter. A "Slug Discharge" is any discharge of a non-
routine, episodic nature, including but not limited to an accidental spill or a
non-customary batch discharge, which has a reasonable potential to cause
Interference or Pass Through, or in any other way violate the POTW's
regulations, Local Limits or Permit conditions.
      (44)   "Storm Water." Any flow occurring during or following any form of
natural precipitation, and resulting from such precipitation, including
snowmelt.

1068.02   GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Chapter 1068 Implementation. The Superintendent is hereby authorized
to establish a written pretreatment program implementation procedure manual as
he or she may deem necessary to implement, administer and enforce the
requirements of this Chapter. The requirements and provision of these
procedures shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of this Chapter.
Should any section or any provision of the procedures be decided by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the procedures as a whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so held to be unconstitutional or invalid.
   (b)   Prohibited Discharge Standards.
      (1)   General Prohibitions. No User shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes Pass Through
or Interference. These general prohibitions apply to all Users of the POTW

sewers for maintenance or repair;
         J.   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's
effluent, thereby violating the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant, Broad
Run WRF, or any County or Sanitation Authority owned or operated treatment
plant NPDES permit;
         K.   Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except
in compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations;
         L.   Storm Water, surface water, ground water, artesian well water,

Explosive Limit of the meter.
         S.   Any substance which may cause a POTW’s effluent or any other
product of a POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and re-use or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no
case, shall a substance discharged to a POTW cause a POTW to potentially be in
noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations
applicable to the approved sludge management method determined by the
applicable control authority to be most advantageous to the respective Blue
Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant, Broad Run WRF, or any County or Sanitation
Authority owned or operated treatment plant.
      (3)   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by the standards
of Section
1068.02 (b)(2) shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they
could be discharged to any POTW.
      (4)   The Prohibited Discharge Standards in Section
1068.02 (b)(2) shall not be construed as a complete list of restrictions.
Restrictions may also be placed on other materials or discharge conditions by
the Superintendent when the nature of a User's discharge exhibits
characteristics sufficient to adversely affect any portion of the collection or
treatment system, human health and safety or the environment.
      (5)   Where the discharge prohibitions for the Blue Plains Wastewater
Treatment Plant are found to be more stringent than provisions in Section
1068.02 (b)(2) the District of Columbia discharge prohibitions applicable to
the Blue Plains Treatment Plant shall prevail. This provision is applicable to
Users for which any portion of their discharge proceeds to the Blue Plains
Wastewater Treatment Plant.
      (6)   Enforcement Provisions contained in this Pretreatment Chapter shall
be applicable, at the discretion of the Superintendent, to any User which
discharges in excess of the Prohibited Dicharge Standards in Section
1068.02 (b)(2) without regard to the User’s status under the permitting
provisions of Section
1068.04  of this Chapter.
   (c)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with
the categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N,
Parts 405-471.
      (1)   Where a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) achieves consistent
removal of pollutants limited by pretreatment standards, the POTW may apply to
the applicable approval authority for modification of specific limits in the
pretreatment standards for Users located in the POTW's collection system based
on removal credits. Such application shall meet all of the requirements of 40
CFR 403.7 for waste treated in the District of Columbia or alternatively for
waste treated within the state of Virginia the requirements of 9 VAC 25-31-790.
The POTW may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the Federal pretreatment
standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR Section 403.7 are fulfilled
and if prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
      (2)   An industrial User or interested person may seek a variance from
categorical standards based on factors that are fundamentally different
(Fundamentally Different Factors, FDF) from the factors considered during
development of a categorical pretreatment standard. Such request must meet all
requirements of 9 VAC 25-31-850 A.-H. Approval will be based on meeting the
conditions in 9 VAC 25-31-850I.-J, which include Public Notice proceedings.
Such request shall be submitted to the Virginia Director of the Department of
Environmental Quality or an authorized representative. Where the Director finds
that FDF do not exist he may deny the request and notify the individual
requesting the variance. Where the Director finds that FDF does exist he shall
forward the request, with a recommendation that the request be approved to the
Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or an
authorized representative.
         A.   Criteria applicable to request less stringent limits shall
include:
            1.   The alternative limit requested is no less stringent than
justified by the fundamental difference;
            2.   The alternative limit will not result in a violation of
prohibitive discharge standards prescribed by or established under 9 VAC 25-31-
770 or Section
1068.02 (b)(2) of this code;
            3.   The alternative limit will not result in a non-water quality
environmental impact (including energy requirements) fundamentally more adverse
than the impact considered during the development of the pretreatment
standards; and
            4.   Compliance with the standards (either by using the
technologies upon which the standards are based or by using other control
alternatives) would result in either:
               a.   A removal cost (adjusted for inflation) wholly out of
proportion to the removal cost considered during development of the standards;
or
               b.   A non-water quality environmental impact (including energy
requirements) fundamentally more adverse than the impacts considered during
development of the standards.
      (3)   Where a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with Sections
1068.02 (b)(6) and (b)(8).
      (4)   When the limits in a categorical Pretreatment Standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
Industrial Users. Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c)(2) 9 VAC 25-31-780 C. 2.
      (5)   When wastewater subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the Superintendent
shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), the
combined wastestream formula as found in 9 VAC 25-31-780 E.
      (6)   When a categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms
of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the County or
Sanitation Authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The
determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the
discretion of the Superintendent. The County may establish equivalent mass
limits only if the Industrial User meets all the conditions set forth in
Sections
1068.02 (c)(6)A.1. through (c)(6)A.5. below. This provision does not apply to
pollutants which are not expressed as concentration based limits such as pH,
temperature, radiation or any other pollutant for which a mass limit is not
appropriate.
         A.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User
must:
            1.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
            2.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
            3.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
            4.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the Discharge; and
            5.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User's request
for equivalent mass limits.
         B.   An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits under
Section
1068.02 (c)(6) must:
            1.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
            2.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use
of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
            3.   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the Superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than
20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph (c)
(6)A.3. of this Section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the
Superintendent will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as
necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
            4.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)A.1.
of this Section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
         C.   When developing equivalent mass limits under Section
1068.02 (c)(6), the Superintendent:
            1.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the Industrial
User by the concentration-based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average Standard for
the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
            2.   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
            3.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the Industrial User's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to Section
1068.02 (g). The Industrial User must also be in compliance with Section
1068.13 (c) regarding the prohibition of bypass.
      (7)   Reserved.
      (8)   The Superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical
Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
Industrial Users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Superintendent. 9
VAC 25-31-780 C. 6. When converting such limits to concentration limits, the
Superintendent will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of
40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 and document that dilution is not being
substituted for treatment as prohibited by Section
1068.02 (g) of this Chapter (see 40 CFR 403.6(d)). In addition, the
Superintendent will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any
changes from concentration to mass limits, or vice versa, and make this
information publicly available (see 40 CFR 403.6(c)(7)).
      (9)   Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply with
the equivalent limitations developed in this Section
1068.02 (c)(6) in lieu of the promulgated categorical Standards from which the
equivalent limitations were derived. 9 VAC 25-31-780 C. 7.
      (10)   Many categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum Monthly Average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
Standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation. 9 VAC
25-31-780 C. 8.
      (11)   Any Industrial User operating under a permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
Standard shall notify the Superintendent within two (2) business days after the
User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying the
Superintendent of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate. 9 VAC 25-31-780 C. 9.
   (d)   State Pretreatment Standards. Users must comply with State
requirements and limitations on discharges in any case where they are more
stringent than Federal requirements and limitations or those in this Chapter. 9
VAC 25-31-730 to 900.
   (e)   Local Limits.
      (1)   The Superintendent is authorized to establish Local Limits pursuant
to 40 CFR 403.5(c).
      (2)   To protect against Pass Through and Interference. No person
discharging to the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant shall discharge
wastewater containing in excess of the current Local Limitations adopted by the
District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority for the Blue Plains Wastewater
Treatment Plant.
      (3)   The Superintendent may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs),
for adoption into this Chapter or in individual wastewater discharge permits or
general permits to implement Local Limits and the requirements of Section
1068.02 (b). 9 VAC 25-31-770 C. 5.
   (f)   Right of Revision. The County, Sanitation Authority and Superintendent
each reserves the right to establish, and adopt into this Chapter or in
individual wastewater discharge permits or in general permits, more stringent
Standards or Requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose
of this Chapter.
   (g)   Dilution. No User shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable Pretreatment Standard or Requirement. The
Superintendent may impose mass limitations on Users who are using dilution to
meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.03   PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (a)   Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this Chapter and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical Pretreatment Standards, Local Limits, and the prohibitions set out
in Section
1068.02(b) of this Chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the
State, or the Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
User's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The
review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the User
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the County or Sanitation Authority under the provisions
of this Chapter.
   (b)   Additional Pretreatment Measures. The Superintendent is hereby
authorized to establish a written Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) procedure manual
as he or she may deem necessary to prevent interference within the POTW. The
requirements and provisions of the grease trap program shall be subject to the
enforcement provisions of this Chapter. Should any section or any provision of
the procedures be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
procedures as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so held to be
unconstitutional or invalid.
   (c)   Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Facility Prevention Measures and
Control Plans. Each industrial User shall provide facility design and chemical
storage prevention measures against accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this Chapter. Facilities to prevent
an accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the industrial User's own cost and expense. The Sanitation
Authority, acting through the Superintendent, shall have the authority and
responsibility to enter upon the property of any such User at any reasonable
time for the purpose of inspecting such facilities. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the Sanitation Authority for review and shall be approved by the
Sanitation Authority before construction of the facility. No industrial User
shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental
discharge facility prevention measures have been approved by the Sanitation
Authority. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the industrial User from the responsibility to modify the industrial
User's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this Chapter.
   The Superintendent shall evaluate whether each SIU additionally needs an
Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge Control Plan or other action to control
Slug Discharges. The Superintendent may require any User to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be
necessary to control Slug Discharges. Alternatively, the Superintendent may
develop such a plan for any User. An Accidental Discharge/Slug Discharge
Control Plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section
1068.06 (f) of this Chapter; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of industrial plant site runoff, worker training,
building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic
organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
   (d)   Hauled Wastewater. The Superintendent is hereby authorized to
establish a written hauled waste acceptance and implementation procedures
manual as he or she may deem necessary to implement, administer and enforce the
rules and requirements under which hauled waste will be accepted. The
requirements and provision of these procedures shall be subject to the
enforcement provisions of this Chapter. Should any section or any provision of
the procedures be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
procedures as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so held to be
unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.04   INDIVIDUAL WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS AND GENERAL PERMITS.
   (a)   Wastewater Analysis. When requested by the Superintendent, a User must
submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within
thirty (30) days of the request. The Superintendent is authorized to prepare a
form for this purpose and may periodically require Users to update this
information.
   (b)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit and General Permit Requirement.
      (1)   No existing User that meets the definition of a Significant
Industrial User shall continue to discharge wastewater into the POTW without
first obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit
from the Superintendent, except that a Significant Industrial User that has
filed a timely application pursuant to Section
1068.04 (c) of this Chapter may continue to discharge for the time period
specified therein.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require other existing Users to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits as necessary to
carry out the purposes of this Chapter.
      (3)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual
wastewater discharge permit or a general permit shall be deemed a violation of
this Chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions
set out in Sections
1068.10  through
1068.12  of this Chapter. Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit
or a general permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply
with all Federal and State Pretreatment Standards or Requirements or with any
other requirements of Federal, State, and local law.
   (c)   Individual Wastewater Discharge and General Permitting: Existing
Connections. Any User required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge
permit or a general permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior

Superintendent a report containing the information described in Section
1068.04(e)(1)F. and G. and
1068.06(a)(2)B. of this Chapter. For Users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in Section
1068.02(c). Note: See 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable
measure of the User's long-term production rate. For all other Users subject to
categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate sampling
period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Section
1068.06(n)(1) of this Chapter. All sampling will be done in conformance with
Section
1068.06(k).
   (d)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   Except as specified in Section
1068.06 (d)(3), all Significant Industrial Users must, at a frequency
determined by the Superintendent submit no less than twice per year (June and
December or on dates specified) reports indicating the nature, concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best
Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the User must
submit documentation required by the Superintendent or the Pretreatment
Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User.
      (2)   The County or Sanitation Authority may authorize an Industrial User
subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a
pollutant regulated by a categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial
User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the
pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is
present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in
the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User, see 40 CFR 403.12(e)
(2), 9 VAC 25-31-840 E.2, and 9 VAC 25-31-800 F.l.c.(l)(b). This authorization
is subject to the following conditions:
         A.   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         B.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than 5 years. The User must submit a new request for the waiver before
the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge
permit. See Section
1068.05 (e)(1)H.
         C.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         D.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with Section
1068.01 (d)(3), and include the certification statement in
1068.06 (n)(1). (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)).
         E.   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
         F.   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Superintendent must be
included as a condition in the User's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Superintendent for three (3) years after expiration of the
waiver.
         G.   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's
permit by the Superintendent, the Industrial User must certify on each report
with the statement in Section
1068.06 (n)(3), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User.
         H.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User's operations,
the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of Section
1068.06 (d)(1), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the
Superintendent, and notify the Superintendent.
         I.   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard.
      (3)   For categorical Users the County or Sanitation Authority may reduce
the requirement for periodic compliance reports to a frequency of not less than
once a year, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by
the EPA/for waste treated in the District of Columbia or The State of Virginia/
for waste treated in Virginia, where the Industrial User's total categorical
wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:
         A.   0.01 percent of the POTW's design dry-weather hydraulic capacity
of the POTW, or five thousand (5,000) gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as
measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the Industrial
User discharges in batches.
         B.   0.01 percent of the design dry-weather organic treatment capacity
of the POTW; and
         C.   0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any
pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard for
which approved Local Limits were developed at the POTW which receives the Users
waste. Test values below a PQL approved by the Superintendent shall be
considered below this threshold. Reduced reporting is not available to
Industrial Users that have in the last two (2) years been in Significant
Noncompliance, as defined in Section
1068.09  of this Chapter. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an
Industrial User with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
decreasing the reporting requirement for this Industrial User would result in
data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting
period. Users with reduced reporting under this clause must notify the
Sanitation Authority immediately upon becoming aware that they no longer meet
one or more of the eligibility criteria contained in Section
1068.06 (d)(3)A. through C.
      (4)   The Sanitation Authority shall maintain for at least three (3)
years the records and documents used in the determination that an industry
meets the provisions of Section
1068.06 (d)(3)A. through C.
      (5)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with Section
1068.06 (n)(1) of this Chapter.
      (6)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (7)   If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the permitted sampling location more
frequently than required by the Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed
in Section
1068.06 (k) of this Chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included
in the report. 40 CFR 403.12(g)(6).
      (8)   Users that send electronic (digital) documents to the County or
Sanitation Authority to satisfy the requirements of this Section must satisfy
the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3 - (Electronic Reporting). 9 VAC 25-31-840 R.
   (e)   Reports of Changed Conditions. Each User must notify the
Superintendent of any significant changes to the User's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least
thirty (30) days before the change.
      (1)   The Superintendent may require the User to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section
1068.04 (e) of this Chapter.
      (2)   The Superintendent may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit or a general permit under Section
1068.04 (h) of this Chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
or a general permit under Section
1068.05 (e) of this Chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
   (f)   Reports of Potential Problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a Slug Discharge or Slug Load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the User shall immediately telephone and
notify the Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the User.
      (2)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the User shall,
unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the User of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of
any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
Chapter.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the User's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees to call in the event of a discharge
described in paragraph (f)(1), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
      (4)   Significant Industrial Users are required to notify the
Superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a Slug Discharge.
   (g)   Reports from Unpermitted Users. All Users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the Superintendent as the Superintendent may require.
   (h)   Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the
Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the Industrial User is not
required if the County or Sanitation Authority performs sampling at the User's
facility at least once a month, or if the County or Sanitation Authority
performs sampling at the User between the time when the initial sampling was
conducted and the time when the User or the County or Sanitation Authority
receives the results of this sampling, or if the County or Sanitation Authority
has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the Industrial User. If the
County or Sanitation Authority performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of
the Industrial User, the County or Sanitation Authority will perform the repeat
sampling and analysis unless it notifies the User of the violation and requires
the User to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. See 40 CFR 403.12(g) (2).
9 VAC 25-31-840 G.2.
   (i)   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste. The discharge of any
waste that would be considered a hazardous waste if otherwise disposed of under
40 CFR Part 261 is prohibited.
   (j)   Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the Superintendent or other parties approved by EPA.
   (k)   Sample Collection. Sample data used to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, and must be representative of conditions occurring
during the reporting period. The Control Authority shall indicate the frequency
of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by the User with
applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
      (1)   Except as indicated in divisions (k)(2) and (3) below, the User
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the County or Sanitation Authority. Where time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the County or
Sanitation Authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge.
Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part
136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-
hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide,
total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or
in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected
by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may
be authorized by the County or Sanitation Authority, as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous
Limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in Section
1068.06 (a) and (c), 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four (4) grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling
data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports
required by paragraphs in Section
1068.06 (d), (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
by with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
   (l)   Date of Receipt of Reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (m)   Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
Chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this Chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the User independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under
Section
1068.02(e)(3). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User
or the County or Sanitation Authority, or where the User has been specifically
notified of a longer retention period by the Superintendent.
   (n)   Certification Statements.
      (1)   Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports and Initial
Monitoring Waiver. The following certification statement is required to be
signed and submitted by Users submitting permit applications in accordance with

(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.07   COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (a)   Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling. The Superintendent or
personnel from the Sanitation Authority shall have the right to enter the
premises of any User to determine whether the User is complying with all
requirements of this Chapter and any individual wastewater discharge permit or
general permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Superintendent
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any
additional duties. The User shall be responsible for the cost of testing any
samples taken from the User's facilities, whether the sample is taken by the
User's personnel or by personnel from the Sanitation Authority.
      (1)   Where a User has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the User shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent shall be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the User's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the User's operations.
      (3)   The Superintendent may require the User to install a monitoring
facility and provide monitoring equipment as necessary for sampling and flow
measurement. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the User at
its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall
be calibrated at the frequency specified in their permit to ensure their
accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
User at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the User.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the
User's premises shall be a violation of this Chapter.
      (6)   The location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in
or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples and analysis and whether constructed on public or private property, the
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the Superintendent’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications, and such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such
manner so as to enable the Superintendent to perform independent monitoring
activities. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following
written notification by the Superintendent to comply.
   (b)   Inspection Warrants. If the Superintendent has been refused access to
a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
Chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the County or Sanitation Authority designed
to verify compliance with this Chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community,
the Superintendent may seek issuance of an inspection warrant from the Circ6uit
Court of Loudoun County, Virginia.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.08   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data regard and pertaining to a User obtained from reports,
surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater
discharge permits, general permits, and monitoring programs, and from the
Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the User specifically requests, and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and
shall be available to the public without restriction.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.09   PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.

applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. The term Significant
Noncompliance shall be applicable to all Significant Industrial Users (or any
other Industrial User that violates paragraphs (c), (d) or (h) of this Section)
and shall mean: see 9 VAC 25-31-800 F.2.h.
   (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements for the
same pollutant parameter taken during a six-(6-) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
Instantaneous Limits as defined in Section
1068.02 ;
   (b)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including
Instantaneous Limits, as defined by Section
1068.02  multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils
and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (c)   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by Section
1068.02  (Daily Maximum, long-term average. Instantaneous Limit, or narrative
standard) that the Superintendent determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, Interference or Pass Through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (d)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to

(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.10   ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Notification of Violation. When the Superintendent finds that a User
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the
Superintendent may serve upon that User a written Notice of Violation. Within
seven (7) days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the
Superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the User of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of
Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
   (b)   Consent Orders. The Superintendent may enter into Consent Orders,
assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement
with any User responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include
specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a
time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force
and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Section
1068.10(d) and (e) of this Chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing.
      (1)   The Superintendent may order a User which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, to appear before the Superintendent and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the User specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User
as defined in Section
1068.01 (d)(3) and required by Section
1068.04 (g)(1). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
      (2)   Conduct. The Board of Directors of the Sanitation Authority may
itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence or may designate any of its
members or any of its officers or employees to:
         A.   Issue, in the name of the governing body, notice of the hearing
requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing;
         B.   Take the evidence; or
         C.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the governing
body for action thereon.
      (3)   Records. At any hearing held pursuant to this Chapter, testimony
taken shall be under oath and recorded. The transcript, so recorded, will be
made available to any member of the public or to any party to the hearing upon
payment of a reasonable charge.
   (d)   Compliance Orders. After the governing body has concluded the hearing
or reviewed the report and recommendations referred to in paragraph (c)(2)C.
hereof, it may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge
directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances have been installed on existing treatment facilities, and such
devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Compliance orders
also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the
amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend
the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the User.
   (e)   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User's past
violations are likely to recur, the Superintendent may issue an order to the
User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
User to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
   (f)   Emergency Suspensions. The Superintendent may immediately suspend a
User's discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably
appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a
User's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, and/or water service suspension to prevent
or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Superintendent may allow the User to recommence its discharge
when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that
the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
Section
1068.10 (g) of this Chapter are initiated against the User.
      (2)   A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent within fifteen (15) days
of the occurrence and prior to the date of any show cause or termination
hearing under Sections
1068.10 (c) or (g) of this Chapter.
      (3)   Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any Emergency Suspension.
   (g)   Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in Section
1068.05(g) of this Chapter, any User who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      (1)   A violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter;
      (2)   A violation of any provision of any written implementation
procedure established by the Superintendent pursuant to Section
1068.02(a) of this Chapter;
      (3)   The discharge of any substance into the publicly owned treatment
works (POTW) without first obtaining any necessary permit;
      (4)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit or general
permit conditions;
      (5)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (6)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (7)   Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (8)   Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in Section
1068.02  of this Chapter.
         Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section
1068.10(c) of this Chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.
Exercise of this option by the Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.11   JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Injunctive Relief. When the Superintendent finds that a User has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Superintendent or County
may petition the Circuit Court of Loudoun County, Virginia for the issuance of
a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, the
general permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Chapter on
activities of the User. The Superintendent or County may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the User to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a User.
   (b)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   A User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement
shall, in lieu of any criminal penalty, be liable for a civil penalty of no
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day and no more than $32,500 per
day for each violation, within the discretion of the court. Each day for which
a violation is proven shall constitute a separate offense.. In the case of a
monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the User's violation, corrective
actions by the User, the compliance history of the User, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (3)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User.
   (c)   Criminal Prosecution. Any Person who willfully or negligently violates
any provision of this Chapter, any order or permit issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment requirement, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by
a fine of no less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per day and
no more than $32,500 per day for each violation, within the discretion of the
court (each day for which a violation is proven shall constitute a separate
violation) or be imprisoned for not more than 12 months, or both.
   (d)   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Chapter are
not exclusive. The Superintendent and County may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant User. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the County's
enforcement response plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action
against any User when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
User.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14; Ord. 19-01. Passed 1-9-19.)
1068.12   SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (a)   Water Supply Severance. Whenever a User has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, water service to the User may be severed. Service will
recommence, at the User's expense, only after the User has satisfactorily
demonstrated its ability to comply.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.13   AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Upset 9 VAC 25-31-880.
      (1)   For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the User. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards if the
requirements of paragraph (a)(3) , below, are met.
      (3)   An Industrial User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         B.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         C.   The User has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five (5) days:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Industrial Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards.
      (6)   Industrial Users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical Pretreatment Standards
upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility
is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (b)   Prohibited Discharge Standards. A User shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in Section
1068.02(b)(1) of this Chapter or the specific prohibitions in Section
1068.02(b)(2)C. through G., I. through Q. and S.) of this Chapter if it can
prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone
or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause Pass Through
or Interference and that either:
      (1)   A Local Limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the User was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the Pass Through
or Interference; or
      (2)   No Local Limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior discharge when
the receiving treatment facility for the facilities waste was regularly in
compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of Interference, was in
compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
   (c)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this Section:
         A.   “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a User's treatment facility.
         B.   “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this Section.
      (3)   Bypass Notifications.
         A.   If an Industrial User knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten (10) days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
         B.   An Industrial User shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent
of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards
within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the
User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent
may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has
been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
      (4)   Bypass.
         A.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (c)(3)
of this section.
         B.   The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (c)(4)A. of this Section.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.14   RESERVED.
1068.15   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Pretreatment Charges and Fees. The Superintendent may adopt reasonable
fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Sanitation
Authority’s Pretreatment Program, which may include:
      (1)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the
cost of processing such applications;
      (2)   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a User's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports and certification statements submitted by Users;
      (3)   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction;
      (4)   Fees for filing appeals;
      (5)   Fees to recover administrative and legal costs (not included in
Section
1068.15 (a)(2)) associated with the enforcement activity taken by the
Superintendent to address IU noncompliance; and
      (6)   Other fees as the Superintendent may deem necessary to carry out
the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters
covered by this Chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and
penalties chargeable by the Sanitation Authority.
   (b)   Severability. If any provision of this Chapter is invalidated by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be affected
and shall continue in full force and effect.
(Ord. 14-03. Passed 3-5-14.)
1068.16   EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This Chapter shall be in full force and effect immediately following its
passage, approval, and publication, as provided by law.

(Ord. 93-11. Passed 9-1-93.)
   (b)   Establishment as Service District; Powers of Board of Supervisors;
Levy and Collection of Special Taxes. The District is established as a service
district pursuant to Section 15.1-18.3, now Section 15.2-2400, of the Code of
Virginia of 1950, as amended. The Board of Supervisors may exercise the powers
set forth in Section 15.2-2403 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, for
the purposes set forth in this section. Annually, the Board of Supervisors may
set the rate for any special tax to be levied on property within the District
in conformance with the procedures for setting other County property taxes. The
Treasurer shall collect any special taxes levied within the District in the
same manner as he or she collects other County property taxes. All taxes levied
and collected pursuant to this section are pledged to finance the costs of the
proposed facilities and services set forth in subsection (d) hereof.
(Ord. 98-01. Passed 3-18-98.)
   (c)   Designation as Development Project Area; Tax Increment Financing.
      (1)   The District is also designated as a development project area
pursuant to Title 58.1, Chapter 32, Article 4, of the Code of Virginia of 1950,
as amended, for the purpose of authorizing tax increment financing within the
District for the cost of the proposed facilities and services set forth in
subsection (d) hereof. Real estate taxes in the District shall be assessed,
collected and allocated in the following manner for so long as any obligations
secured by the Broad Run Farms Tax Increment Financing Fund, which is hereby
established and described herein, are outstanding and unpaid:
         A.   The local assessing officer shall record in the land book both
the base assessed value and the current assessed value of the real estate in
the District.
         B.   Real estate taxes attributable to the lower of the current
assessed value or base assessed value of the real estate located in the
District shall be allocated by the Treasurer or the Director of Finance
pursuant to Title 58.1, Chapter 32, of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as
amended.
         C.   Real estate taxes attributable to the increased value between the
current assessed value of any parcel of real estate and the base assessed value
of such real estate shall be allocated by the Treasurer or the Director of
Finance and paid into a special fund entitled the “Broad Run Farms Tax
Increment Financing Fund” to pay the principal and interest on obligations
undertaken by the County to finance the costs of the proposed facilities and
services set forth in subsection (d) hereof.
      (2)   Funds in the Broad Run Farms Tax Increment Financing Fund are
pledged to any obligations undertaken by the County to finance the costs of the
proposed facilities and services set forth in subsection (d) hereof, to the
extent not qualifying as surplus funds in accordance with Section 58.1-3245.4
of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended.
      (3)   Terms used in this section shall have the definitions ascribed to
them in Section 58.1-3245 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended.
   (d)   Purpose; Proposed Facilities and Services. The purpose of the District
is to finance the installation of sewer collector lines within the District and
to make available public sewage treatment to serve properties within the
District.
   (e)   Construction of Facilities and Services. The sewer collector lines are
proposed to be constructed by or under the management of the Loudoun County
Sanitation Authority and connected to the existing sewer line, known as the
Potomac Interceptor, which traverses the District. The costs of construction
and all or a portion of sewer availability charges may be financed by a loan
through the Virginia State Water Control Board or the Virginia Resources
Authority or by another method of financing authorized by the Board of
Supervisors in accordance with State law.
   (f)   Benefits. The Virginia Department of Health has declared the property
within the Broad Run Farms Subdivision encompassed by the District to be a
major health hazard due to the prevalence of failing private sewage treatment
systems on individual properties. The provision of a sewage collection system
and the availability of public sewage treatment for the community will protect
the health and safety of the residents and conserve property values within the
District.
   (g)   References to State Law. All references to the Code of Virginia in
this section include those provisions as they exist on the date of the adoption
of this section, and as they may be subsequently amended or recodified.

The Board of Supervisors finds that all of the owners of these properties have
petitioned for the special assessment and that all of these properties will be
benefited by the improvements. These property owners have agreed to the
allocation of the costs of the project and the imposition of the assessment on
their respective real property as set forth in their petition, which allocation
is included in division (d) of this section. In the event that any of these
properties are subdivided, the unpaid balance of the special assessment shall
be reallocated among the resulting parcels in proportion to the resulting
acreage of each parcel. In the event that any of these parcels are
consolidated, the unpaid balance of the special assessment for the resulting
parcel shall include the unpaid balance of the special assessment for each
original parcel. In the event that any of these parcels are enlarged or reduced
by boundary line adjustment, it shall not affect the amount of the special
assessment.
   (b)   Improvements to be Funded. The improvements to be funded by the
assessment are the extension of water and sewer lines to serve the properties
identified in division (a) of this section. The County of Loudoun will not be
undertaking the construction of the improvements. These lines are proposed to
be constructed by the Loudoun County Sanitation Authority (LCSA) and are more
particularly identified as LCSA Project No. 2006-0093. Upon completion of the
improvements by LCSA, the County of Loudoun shall reimburse LCSA for its actual
costs to establish the water and sewer lines serving these properties, such
reimbursement to be made solely from the collection of the special assessment
imposed pursuant to this section. LCSA costs will include reasonable
construction, engineering, legal and administrative costs to design and
construct the project. The Board of Supervisors and County of Loudoun are
responsible only for imposing the special assessment, collecting the semi-
annual installments, and reimbursing LCSA for actual costs upon completion of
the project solely from the special assessment revenues. The Board of
Supervisors and County of Loudoun make no pledge, legal or moral, to fund the
improvements from general revenues, financing proceeds or any special revenues
other than the special assessment imposed by this section.
   (c)   Amount of Special Assessment. The amount of the assessments on the
properties identified in division (a) of this section may not exceed one
million, three hundred seventy-two thousand, five hundred fifty-seven dollars
and sixty-seven cents ($1,372,557.67), which is the estimated project cost
provided by LCSA.
   (d)   Allocation of Special Assessment. The assessment shall be allocated
among the benefited properties as follows:

These revisions reflect only the reductions resulting from the final project
cost. The principal portion of any prior and future semi-annual payments
received by the County will be applied against the assessments as revised by
Ordinance 11-08, passed September 7, 2011.
   (e)   Collection of Special Assessment. The assessment shall be paid in
equal, semi-annual installments collected over a period of ten years. The
payments shall be billed and collected semi- annually at the same time the
general real estate property tax is levied and collected by the County of
Loudoun. The Board of Supervisors expressly declines to adopt any provision for
postponement of payment as authorized by Va. Code § 15.2-2407.
   (f)   Interest. Interest shall be applied on the unpaid balances at an
annual rate of the index of average yield on United States Treasury securities
adjusted to a constant maturity of one year, as made available by the Federal
Reserve Bank at the time the assessment ordinance is adopted.
   (g)   Lien. Upon completion of the improvements described in division (b) of
this section, the special assessment apportioned to each property shall become
a lien enforceable against any person with notice under Va. Code § 15.2-2412.
   (h)   Effective Date. This section shall be effective upon its adoption.

   (b)   Improvements To Be Financed. The improvements to be financed by the
Special Assessment are the extension of public water and sanitary sewer main
lines to serve the Properties (the "Project"). The Project does not include
water and sewer laterals from structures to the main line, abandonment of
existing water or wastewater facilities, or payment of Availability Fees or
Charges to Loudoun Water.
   (c)   Apportionment of Special Assessment. The Special Assessment is hereby
apportioned among the Properties based on parcel size, as summarized in the
Table above. Each of the Abutting Landowners has executed an Agreement for
Special Assessment to Construct Water and Sanitary Sewer Lines ("Special
Assessment Agreement") acknowledging, agreeing and consenting to the
apportionment of the Special Assessment as provided in detail in Attachment 3
to the Special Assessment Agreement. The Board hereby approves and authorizes
execution of the Special Assessment Agreement, which is made part of this
Ordinance as Appendix A.
   (d)   Service Agreement with Loudoun Water. The Project is to be designed
and constructed by Loudoun Water, pursuant to a separate service agreement to
be executed by the Board and Loudoun Water ("Service Agreement"). The Special
Assessment is contingent upon execution of the Service Agreement. The Special
Assessment shall take effect immediately upon delivery of a fully-executed
Service Agreement to the Board.
   (e)   Adjustment of Special Assessment. The Special Assessment amount has
been determined based on the total estimated Project cost plus a contingency of
thirty percent (30%). Upon completion of the Project, Loudoun Water shall
provide to the Board a final accounting of the Project costs. Upon receipt of
the final accounting, and in accordance with Virginia Code § 15.2-2412, the
Special Assessment and the corresponding amount apportioned to each Abutting
Landowner shall be amended, if appropriate, to reflect the actual Project
costs; however, in no event shall the amount of the Special Assessment or the
share apportioned to each Abutting Landowner be increased above the maximum
amount identified in this section.
   (f)   Installment Payments. In accordance with Virginia Code § 15.2-2413,
the Abutting Landowners may pay their apportioned share of the Special
Assessment in equal installments over a period not exceeding twenty (20) years,
together with interest on the unpaid balances at an annual interest rale of
0.82%. The installments shall be due and payable at the same time that real
estate taxes are due and payable in the County.
   (g)   Penalty and Interest for Delinquent Balances. In accordance with
Virginia Code § 15.2-105, in the event an Abutting Landowner fails to pay any
installment on or before its due date, a penalty in an amount equal to ten
percent of the delinquent payment shall be added to the Abutting Landowner's
account. Delinquency interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) annually shall
be collected upon the principal and penalty of all delinquent accounts.
   (h)   Docketing. In accordance with Virginia Code § 15.2-2411 and 15.2-2412,
an abstract of this Ordinance shall be recorded among the land records of the
Loudoun County Circuit Court, and such abstract shall be amended upon final
accounting and adjustment of the Special Assessment as provided in division (e)
of this section.
   (i)   Effective Date. This section shall take effect immediately.

specified in the warrant or within the extended or renewed time. After the
expiration of such time, the warrant, unless executed, shall be void. An
inspection pursuant to such warrant may not be made in the absence of the
owner, custodian or possessor of the particular place, thing or person unless
specifically authorized by the judicial officer upon a snowing that such
authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter. An
inspection pursuant to this warrant shall not be made by means of forcible
entry, except that the judicial officer may expressly authorize a forcible
entry where facts are shown sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of a
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter which, if such violation
existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety, or where facts are
shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have
been unsuccessful. In the case of inspection of a dwelling, prior consent must
be sought and refused unless the issuing judicial officer finds that failure to
seek consent is justified and that there is a reasonable suspicion of an
immediate threat to public health or safety.

activity, provided that:
         A.   Not more than 500 cubic yards of yard waste generated off-site is
received at the owner's said property in any consecutive twelve-month period;
         B.   No compensation is received, either directly or indirectly, by
the owner or other persons authorized by the owner of said property from
parties providing yard waste generated off said property; and
         C.   The activity poses no nuisance or present or potential threat to
human health or the environment.
   (c)   Application for Permits. Every person desiring a permit under this
chapter shall submit a written application to the Director in the format
specified by the Director. An application for a permit shall not constitute
authorization to operate pending action on the request. The application shall
provide sufficient information to address the requirements of this chapter.
When co-processed with State permit applications, complete copies of the Part A
and Part B application to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality
shall be provided to the County. Copies of the construction contract documents
or such documents as are required by the permit by rule provision in 9 VAC 20-
80 (solid waste management), and 9 VAC 20-101 (vegetative waste management and
yard waste composting) shall be provided to the County when they are submitted
to the State. In addition, the Director may require reasonable additional
information as deemed necessary due to site conditions and to determine site
suitability (i.e., additional geotechnical borings, wells, etc.).
   (d)   Conformance With Zoning Ordinance. An application for a permit under
this chapter shall be submitted contemporaneously with a letter of compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance from the Zoning Administrator, or with copies of the
application for a special exception permit if required by the Zoning Ordinance.
Prior to acting upon an application for a solid waste management facility
permit, the Director shall require the applicant to furnish evidence from the
Department of Building and Development that the property and the proposed use
are in compliance with the land use requirements of the County.
   (e)   Waivers of Technical Requirements. Upon petition to the Director, the
applicant may request of the Board a waiver of any technical application
submission requirement, provided that the Director finds that such requirement
(s) are not necessary to demonstrate compliance with the intent of this
chapter. Upon petition to the Director, the applicant for any existing facility
that has been deemed in compliance with this chapter may request of the Board a
waiver of any siting or operational regulation required by this chapter,
provided that such waiver will not place a solid waste management facility in
noncompliance with any State or Federal requirements and only upon a finding
that such waiver will not result in a negative impact on the environment or
cause a public nuisance.
   (f)   Public Participation Process Required. Before any solid waste
management facility permit required by this chapter is issued, the Director
will advertise the intent to issue said permit for two successive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the County in which the public will be
invited to submit written comment on the proposed permit regarding any aspect
of alleged non-conformance contained in the proposed permit. A draft of the
proposed permit will be kept at the Loudoun County Office of Solid Waste
Management for review by the public during regular business hours. Written
comment from the public will be accepted for thirty calendar days following the
first advertisement of intent to issue. All written comments which are timely
submitted will be reviewed by the Director. No permit shall be issued prior to
the completion of the public participation process.
   (g)   Temporary Permit. An applicant whose permit and/or CTO has expired or
who was not previously required to obtain a permit and/or CTO, and who has been
in operation for at least one calendar year immediately prior to the submission
of the application in full compliance with all applicable requirements of this
chapter, may apply to the Director for a temporary permit. An application for a
temporary permit shall not constitute authorization to operate pending action
on the request. Any such application shall be presented to the Board of
Supervisors for approval.
      The Board of Supervisors shall determine the duration of the temporary
permit which shall in no case exceed six months, and which shall not be subject
to renewal or extension. The temporary permit shall be contingent upon the
applicant's continuing adherence to a permitting compliance schedule
established in advance by the Director, and provided that the operation of the
facility does not pose a present or potential hazard to public health or the
environment. If at any time the Director finds that the applicant has failed to
adhere to the compliance schedule or that continued operation of the facility
constitutes a present or potential hazard to public health or the environment,
the temporary permit shall be withdrawn and the facility shall cease
operations.
(Ord. 99-06. Passed 5-19-99.)
   (h)   Limits on Facility Permits. No permit shall be issued by the Director
to any facility to process, manage, sort, store or transfer more than 600 tons
of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day. The aggregate permitted tonnage at all
facilities, excluding the County Landfill, shall not exceed 750 tons of
municipal solid waste per day. For the purposes of this subsection, tons per
day is defined as the total tonnage of MSW accepted by the facility in any
consecutive seven-day period of operation, divided by seven. The County
Landfill is exempt from this subsection. This subsection shall not apply to
consumer separated recyclables, vegetative waste or construction waste. All
permits issued after the date of adoption of this subsection shall conform to

1082.01   SHORT TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Loudoun County Solid
Waste Storage Ordinance.”
(Ord. 92-08. Passed 8-5-92.)
1082.02   DEFINITIONS.
   Words and terms used in this chapter shall be defined as provided in Section
1080.02.
(Ord. 92-08. Passed 8-5-92.)
1082.03   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT; RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Health Director, or his or her agent, shall be responsible for the
administration and enforcement of this chapter. The Health Director, or his or
her agent, may, with proper identification, enter, at reasonable times, upon
public or private property for the purposes of inspecting and investigating
conditions relating to the enforcement of this chapter, but only after
obtaining consent of the owner or occupant of the private property to be
inspected, which owner or occupant has the authority, under law, to authorize
such entry and inspection. If such consent is not obtained, for any reason,
including the inability to contact or locate the person with the authority to
authorize such inspection, the Health Director shall obtain, from a County
magistrate or judge, a warrant authorizing such entry, inspection or
investigation upon such private property upon a showing of probable cause,
supported by an affidavit, particularly describing the place, thing or person
to be inspected or investigated and the purpose for which the inspection or
investigation is to be made. Probable cause shall be deemed to exist either if
reasonable administrative standards for conducting such inspection or
investigation are satisfied, with respect to the particular place, thing or
person, or if there exists probable cause to believe that there is a condition,
object, activity or circumstance which legally justifies such inspection or
investigation. The supporting affidavit shall contain either a statement that
consent to inspect or investigate has been sought and refused or not received
or a description of the circumstances reasonably justifying the failure to seek
such consent in order to effectively enforce this chapter. An inspection
warrant shall be effective for the time specified therein, not to exceed ten
days, unless extended or renewed by the judicial officer who signed and issued
the original warrant, upon a showing that such extension or renewal is in the
public interest. Such warrant shall be executed and returned to the judicial
officer by whom it was issued within the time specified in the warrant or
within the extended or renewed time. After the expiration of such time, the
warrant, unless executed, shall be void. An inspection pursuant to such warrant
may not be made in the absence of the owner, custodian or possessor of the
particular place, thing or person unless specifically authorized by the
judicial officer upon a showing that such authority is reasonably necessary to
effectuate the purpose of this chapter. An inspection pursuant to this warrant
shall not be made by means of forcible entry, except that the judicial officer
may expressly authorize a forcible entry where facts are shown sufficient to
create a reasonable suspicion of a violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter which, if such violation existed, would be an immediate threat to
health or safety, or where facts are shown establishing that reasonable
attempts to serve a previous warrant have been unsuccessful. In the case of
inspection of a dwelling, prior consent must be sought and refused unless the
issuing judicial officer finds that failure to seek consent is justified and
that there is a reasonable suspicion of an immediate threat to public health or
safety. No person shall willfully refuse to permit an inspection lawfully
authorized by a warrant issued pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 92-08. Passed 8-
5-92.)
1082.04   PROHIBITIONS.
   No person may engage in the removal, storage, disposal or treatment of solid
waste in such a manner as to create a public nuisance, pollute the air, cause a
discharge of pollutants to the waters of this County or otherwise impair the
quality of the environment or create a hazard to the public safety, health or
well-being.
(Ord. 92-08. Passed 8-5-92.)

   No person shall fail to provide for adequate storage and handling of solid
waste on the premises of which he or she is the owner, occupant or custodian
and for collection from such premises so as not to create a nuisance or an
environmental or public health hazard to neighboring properties. Any action or
practice which is in violation of any of the requirements of this chapter shall
be considered a violation by the owner, occupant or custodian of the premises
in question.
(Ord. 92-08. Passed 8-5-92.)
1082.06   STORAGE PRACTICES.

around the location of storage containers by appropriate controls in order that
vectors do not constitute a nuisance to neighboring properties or a health
hazard.
   (e)   Before being stored, rubbish shall be placed in storage containers or
cut and baled, tied, bundled, stacked or packaged so as not to exceed thirty-
six inches in length and fifty pounds in weight, where such rubbish is to be

are of the type that can be mechanically lifted and emptied by a collection
vehicle, in which case they shall be of appropriate size and design. All
storage containers shall be leak-proof.
   (c)   No person shall permit the accumulation of residue of liquids or
solids or a combination of such materials on the bottom or sides of a
container. The interior of a container shall be kept clean by thorough cleaning
and sanitizing as often as necessary.
   (d)   Storage containers shall be kept in good repair. Containers with
loosely fitting lids or doors or containing holes or cracks shall not be used.
   (e)   All storage containers designed for mechanical lifting shall be
designed, constructed and placed to prevent accidental overturning. Such
containers shall be constructed of fire retardant material. Standards of the
Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission shall be used in determining
compliance with this subsection.
(Ord. 92-08. Passed 8-5-92.)
1082.08   FREQUENCY OF COLLECTION.
   (a)   Municipal solid waste shall be collected and transported to an
approved disposal site not less than once every two weeks.
   (b)   Hotels, restaurants, institutions, apartments and commercial
establishments may be required to have more frequent collections if such
collection is determined by the Health Director, or his or her agent, to be
advisable to protect the public health or to abate a public nuisance.
(Ord. 92-08. Passed 8-5-92.)
1082.09   EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   In addition to the penalty provided in Section
1082.99, the Health Director may initiate injunction, mandamus, abatement or

administrative actions and civil and criminal penalties as authorized by this
chapter.
   (b)   Right of Entry. The Director, or his or her agent, may, with proper
identification, enter, at reasonable times, upon public or private property for
the purposes of inspecting and investigating conditions relating to the
enforcement of this chapter, but only after obtaining consent of the owner or
occupant of the private property to be inspected, which owner or occupant has
the authority, under law, to authorize such entry and inspection.
   (c)   Inspection Warrant.
      (1)   If such consent is not obtained for any reason or a justifiable
reason exists for not seeking consent, including the inability to contact or
locate the person with the authority to authorize such inspection, the Director
shall obtain, from a County magistrate or judge, a warrant authorizing such
entry, inspection or investigation upon such private property upon a showing of
probable cause, supported by an affidavit, particularly describing the place,
thing, or person to be inspected or investigated, and the purpose for which the
inspection or investigation is to be made. Probable cause shall be deemed to
exist either if reasonable administrative standards for conducting such
inspection or investigation are satisfied, with respect to the particular
place, thing or person, or if there exists probable cause to believe that there
is a condition, object, activity, or circumstance which legally justifies such
inspection or investigation. The supporting affidavit shall contain either a
statement that consent to inspect or investigate has been sought and refused or
not received or a description of the circumstances reasonably justifying the
failure to seek such consent in order to effectively enforce this chapter.
      (2)   An inspection warrant shall be effective for the time specified
therein, not to exceed ten days, unless extended or renewed by the judicial
officer who signed and issued the original warrant, upon a showing that such
extension or renewal is in the public interest. Such warrant shall be executed
and returned to the judicial officer by whom it was issued within the time
specified in the warrant or within the extended or renewed time. After the
expiration of such time, the warrant, unless executed, shall be void. An
inspection pursuant to such warrant may not be made in the absence of the
owner, custodian or possessor of the particular place, thing, or person unless
specifically authorized by the judicial officer upon a showing that such
authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter. An
inspection pursuant to this warrant shall not be made by means of forcible
entry, except that the judicial officer may expressly authorize a forcible
entry where facts are shown sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of a
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter which, if such violation
existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety, or where facts are
shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have
been unsuccessful. In the case of inspection of a dwelling, prior consent must
be sought and refused, unless the issuing judicial officer finds that failure
to seek consent is justified and that there is a reasonable suspicion of an
immediate threat to public health or safety.
   (d)   Compliance With Inspection Warrants. No person shall willfully refuse
to permit an inspection lawfully authorized by a warrant issued pursuant to
this chapter.

to the Director and submitted along with the vehicle information and
documentation required under subsection
1084.06(c) and the applicable fee as provided for in subsection 1084.06(d). The

these Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Exclusions. This chapter shall not apply to any person that resides or
any business that is located solely in any incorporated town within the
boundaries of Loudoun County unless and until the governing body of any such
town, by appropriate action, indicates its intention to have recyclable
material covered by the provisions of this chapter. Upon the taking of such
action by the governing body of any such incorporated town, the provisions of
this chapter shall apply fully in such incorporated town.
(Ord. 02-08. Passed 5-20-02.)
1086.04   PURPOSE.
   The general purpose of this chapter is the furtherance of effective solid
waste management and the recycling of solid waste as provided for in Section
10.1-1411 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, and as authorized by
Section 15.2-937 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended.
(Ord. 02-08. Passed 5-20-02.)
1086.05   ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Administrative Authority. The Director of Solid Waste Management, or
his or her agent, shall be responsible for the administration of this chapter
and shall have the authority to enforce compliance through the use of criminal
and civil penalties as authorized by this chapter.
   (b)   Right of Entry. The Director, or his or her agent, may, with proper
identification, enter, at reasonable times, upon public or private property for
the purposes of inspecting and investigating conditions relating to the
enforcement of this chapter, but only after obtaining consent of the owner or
occupant of the private property to be inspected, which owner or occupant has
the authority, under law, to authorize such entry and inspection.
   (c)   Inspection Warrant.
      (1)   If such consent is not obtained for any reason or a justifiable
reason exists for not seeking consent, including the inability to contact or
locate the person with the authority to authorize such inspection, the Director
shall obtain, from a County magistrate or judge, a warrant authorizing such
entry, inspection or investigation upon such private property upon a showing of
probable cause, supported by an affidavit, particularly describing the place,
thing, or person to be inspected or investigated, and the purpose for which the
inspection or investigation is to be made. Probable cause shall be deemed to
exist either if reasonable administrative standards for conducting such
inspection or investigation are satisfied, with respect to the particular
place, thing or person, or if there exists probable cause to believe that there
is a condition, object, activity, or circumstance which legally justifies such
inspection or investigation. The supporting affidavit shall contain either a
statement that consent to inspect or investigate has been sought and refused or
not received or a description of the circumstances reasonably justifying the
failure to seek such consent in order to effectively enforce this chapter.
      (2)   An inspection warrant shall be effective for the time specified
therein, not to exceed ten days, unless extended or renewed by the judicial
officer who signed and issued the original warrant, upon a showing that such
extension or renewal is in the public interest. Such warrant shall be executed
and returned to the judicial officer by whom it was issued within the time
specified in the warrant or within the extended or renewed time. After the
expiration of such time, the warrant, unless executed, shall be void. An
inspection pursuant to such warrant may not be made in the absence of the
owner, custodian or possessor of the particular place, thing, or person unless
specifically authorized by the judicial officer upon a showing that such
authority is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter. An
inspection pursuant to this warrant shall not be made by means of forcible
entry, except that the judicial officer may expressly authorize a forcible
entry where facts are shown sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of a
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter which, if such violation
existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety, or where facts are
shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have
been unsuccessful. In the case of inspection of a dwelling, prior consent must
be sought and refused, unless the issuing judicial officer finds that failure
to seek consent is justified and that there is a reasonable suspicion of an
immediate threat to public health or safety.
   (d)   Compliance With Inspection Warrants. No person shall willfully refuse
to permit an inspection lawfully authorized by a warrant issued pursuant to
this chapter.

way or place, such person shall immediately cause such contents to be gathered
up and removed.
   (c)   Rebuttable Presumption. When a violation of the provisions of this

1090.01   PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (a)   When properly managed, land application of biosolids represents the
beneficial use of a recycled nutrient product. The purpose of this chapter is
to provide the safe application of Class B biosolids on agricultural land by
applying requirements designed to assure proper management, thereby minimizing
associated problems, including health hazards, environmental degradation, and
nuisance complaints.
   (b)   This chapter is not intended to regulate the land application of
animal waste, or water treatment plant sludge, or “exceptional quality”
biosolids.
(Ord. 99-05. Passed 4-7-99.)
1090.02   DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Biosolids” means a sewage sludge that has received an established
treatment for required pathogen control and is treated or managed to reduce
vector attraction to a satisfactory level and contains acceptable levels of
pollutants, such that it is acceptable for use for land application, marketing
or distribution in accordance with this chapter, as defined by the Virginia
Biosolids Use Regulations (BUR), in VAC5-58, October 15, 1997.
   (b)   “Class B Biosolids” means a sludge that receives Class I or II
treatment for adequate pathogen control and is treated or managed to properly
reduce vector attraction and acceptable levels of pollutants (Table 8-A, BUR).
   (c)   “Exceptional quality biosolids” means a Class I treated sludge with
approved control of vector attraction and acceptable levels of pollutants
(Table 8-B, BUR).
   (d)   “Perennial stream” (as defined by the National Soil Survey Handbook,
USDA Title 430) means a stream or reach of a stream that flows continuously
throughout the year and whose surface is generally lower than the water table
adjacent to the region adjoining the stream. Perennial streams are designated
by a one dot soil drainage symbol (--.--) in the Loudoun County Soil Drains
Coverage.
   (e)   “Intermittent stream” (as defined by the National Soil Survey
Handbook, USDA Title 430) means a stream or reach of a stream that does not
flow year-round and that flows only when it receives baseflow solely during wet
periods, or when it receives ground water discharge or protracted contributions
from melting snow or other erratic surface and shallow subsurface sources (see
also ephemeral). Intermittent streams are designated by a three dot soil
drainage symbol (__...__) in the Loudoun County Soil Drains Coverage.
(Ord. 99-05. Passed 4-7-99.)

   (a)   No person shall apply Class B biosolids to any land in the County
without first obtaining a permit from the Loudoun Department of Public Health.
This local permit is required in addition to all State, Federal or other
applicable permits and approvals. Local permits may be issued for time periods
up to five years; however, the local permit shall not extend beyond the time
period covered by other permits.
   (b)   Before additional land can be permitted for land application of
biosolids, application must be made for amendment to existing local permits.

1090.05   APPLICATION REVIEW AND APPROVAL.
   (a)   All applications will be reviewed by the Loudoun County Soil Scientist
and the Loudoun Department of Public Health. The County Soil Scientist will
evaluate each application considering any and all factors which may potentially
lead to problems with run-off or environmental contamination. The Loudoun
Department of Public Health will evaluate each application for potential health
and nuisance problems, proximity to housing and the likelihood of objectionable
odors. Upon completion of review, the Public Health Department will either (i)
deny the biosolids application permit or amendment if it fails to mitigate any
deleterious run off or otherwise fails to comply with the standards in this
chapter or established State and Federal standards, or (ii) approve the
biosolids application permit or amendment subject to such conditions, if any,
as are necessary to mitigate nuisance impacts such as objectionable odor, or to
prevent environmental contamination. The Public Health Department shall notify
the applicant, in writing, of the action on the permit or amendment.
   (b)   Appeals of application denials or conditions will be made to the
Health Director. Upon request for review by the applicant, the Health Director
will arrange a review hearing during which all relevant data and information
will be considered. The Director shall, within fourteen days of the review,
issue a finding, which is considered to be final. Appeal beyond the Health
Director is to the appropriate circuit court.
(Ord. 99-05. Passed 4-7-99.)
1090.06   NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   Effective communication is a prerequisite to minimizing problems associated

application.
   (c)   Applicators shall provide written notice to adjacent (contiguous)
property owners, including those property owners across road or utility
easements, prior to application. The timing of this written notice shall be
such that it precedes application by at least two weeks, but not more than one
year. Applicators are encouraged to notify and follow-up with other owners that
might be affected by the application.
(Ord. 99-05. Passed 4-7-99.)
1090.07   RESPONSIBILITY OF BIOSOLIDS PRODUCER.
   The producer of the biosolids is responsible for the quality of the product.
It is the responsibility of the producer to meet or exceed all applicable
Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances. It is also the
responsibility of the producer to treat its biosolids such that obnoxious odor
problems do not result at the application site with the employment of best
management field practices. Loudoun County reserves the right to review records
of the producer to determine compliance with all applicable standards,
particularly those concerning the following State and Federal regulations:
   (a)   Monitoring Regulated Parameters.
      (1)   Inorganic pollutants (metals)
      (2)   Pathogenic indicators
      (3)   Vector attraction characteristics (including odor potential).

biosolids.
         E.   Use aerobic processes at greater than forty degrees Celsius
(average temperatures forty-five degrees Celsius) for fourteen days or longer
(e.g., during biosolids composting).
         F.   Add alkaline materials to raise the pH under specified
conditions.
         G.   Reduce moisture content of biosolids that do not contain
unstabilized solids from other than primary treatment to at least seventy-five
percent solids.
         H.   Reduce moisture content of biosolids with unstabilized solids to
at least ninety percent.
         I.   Inject biosolids beneath the soil surface within a specified

(Ord. 99-05. Passed 4-7-99.)
1090.08   RESPONSIBILITY OF BIOSOLIDS APPLICATOR.
   The applicator of the biosolids is responsible for application which meets
or exceeds all applicable provisions of Federal, State, and local laws,
regulations and ordinances. The applicator has a responsibility to investigate
alternatives which, due to obnoxious odors or any other noncompliance, will
cause potential problems when applied in the field. Loudoun County reserves the
right to review applicator records to determine compliance with all applicable
standards, including, but not limited to, the following:
   (a)   Buffers.
      (1)   Water supplies and occupied dwellings
      (2)   Surface water
      (3)   Drainageways (as defined by this chapter)
      (4)   Other.
         When surface applying biosolids on Hydrologic Group D Soils (see
Loudoun County Soil Hydrologic Map #98-0018) the buffers for perennial and
intermittent streams identified in the Virginia Biosolids Use Regulations
(BUR), Section 12 VAC-5-585, page 32, shall be doubled.
   (b)   Loading Rates.
      (1)   Nitrogen
      (2)   CCE
      (3)   Pollutants.

1090.09   COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS.
   Upon receipt of complaints related to biosolids, the Loudoun Department of
Public Health will investigate in conjunction with the County Soil Scientist,
and will notify the applicator as soon as possible. Enforcement action may be
necessary in response to complaints that are investigated and found to be
justified. No person shall apply biosolids generating persistent, obnoxious
odors offensive to persons of ordinary sensitivity across property lines after
land application. Significantly offensive and obnoxious odors which result in
multiple complaints reported to the Health Department may be considered a
violation of this chapter, and may result in enforcement action, including, but
not limited to, suspension or revocation of the permit under which biosolids
are being applied.
   Such action may be specific to the producer of the biosolids (and not to the
applicator) when investigation reveals that the problem resulted from the
nature of the applied biosolids, as opposed to application procedures.
(Ord. 99-05. Passed 4-7-99.)
1090.99   PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a
Class 3 misdemeanor. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day
during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues. In
addition, so as to prevent continuing problems, the following enforcement
provisions will apply:
   (a)   Producer. If it is found that biosolids quality (including local
persistent obnoxious odor restrictions in this chapter) does not comply with
the provisions of Federal, State, or local regulations or ordinances, the
Loudoun County Health Department shall issue a notice of intent to suspend or
revoke this producer's biosolids from further application within Loudoun
County. This shall be sent by certified mail to the last known address of the
producer. A maximum thirty-day period shall be provided for the producer to
appeal such notice, and to supply scientific data demonstrating compliance with
all regulatory requirements. If such appeal is not made, or is not sufficient
to demonstrate compliance, a notice of violation shall be issued resulting in a
six-month suspension of that producer's biosolids from application within
Loudoun County. Following the expiration of the suspension, the producer shall
be required to meet with representatives of Loudoun County and review the
improvements to the operation prior to a formally approved resumption of
application of biosolids within Loudoun County.
      The second time a suspension from the same producer is necessary (if it
occurs within two years of the reinstatement date), the suspension will be for
one year. The third suspension shall result in a ban of that producer's
biosolids being applied in Loudoun County for a term of two years. Following a
two-year suspension, a reinstatement fee will be required prior to
reinstatement.
   (b)   Applicator. If it is found that the biosolids application (including
local persistent obnoxious odor restrictions in this chapter) does not comply
with the provisions of Federal, State, or local regulations or ordinances, the
Loudoun Department of Public Health shall issue a notice of intent to suspend
or revoke permits in the name of this applicator from continued operation
within Loudoun County. This shall be sent by certified mail to the last known
address of the applicator. A maximum thirty-day period shall be provided for
the applicator to appeal such notice and supply scientific data demonstrating
compliance with all regulatory requirements. If such appeal is not made or is
not sufficient to demonstrate compliance, a notice of violation shall be issued
resulting in a suspension of that applicator's operation from within Loudoun
County for a six-month period. Following the expiration of the suspension, the
applicator shall be required to meet with representatives of Loudoun County and
review improvements to the operation prior to a formally approved resumption of
operations within Loudoun County.
      The second time a suspension from the same applicator is necessary (if it
occurs within two years of the reinstatement date), the suspension will be for
one year.
      The third suspension shall result in a two-year suspension of that
applicator's permits to apply in Loudoun County. Following a two-year
suspension, a reinstatement fee will be required prior to reinstatement. (Ord.
99-05. Passed 4-7-99.)
Appendix I   Fees for Land Application of Biosolids
Fixed fees are established for plan review, site evaluations and permitting as
follows:
Plan Review and Permit Fee = $200.00 (5 year cycle) + (# acres x $2.00/acre)

to the office of the Director of Parks and Recreation not less than seven days
prior to the planned start of the gathering. The County Administrator or his or
her designee will either grant the permit, with or without conditions, or deny
the permit within seventy-two hours after receiving the application. If the
County Administrator or his or her designee fails to act upon the application
within the seventy-two hour period, the permit shall be deemed to be granted.
For purposes of the foregoing requirement, receipt of the application on a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday shall be deemed received on the next regular
business day. A denial of the permit shall be accompanied by a statement of the
reasons for the denial.
   For events planned within the seven-day period, where a delay in seeking the

event, if he or she is satisfied that the remaining provisions of this section
can and will be complied with by the applicant and that the County's legitimate
interest in adequate planning for the event can be satisfied.
   (d)   The application shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The full names, mailing addresses and telephone numbers of the
persons and organizations sponsoring and arranging the proposed activity;
      (2)   The full name, mailing address and telephone number of the

      (7)   Pollution Prevention Plan:
         A.   A Pollution Prevention Plan, required by 9VAC25-875-520, shall be
developed, implemented, and updated as necessary and must detail the design,
installation, implementation, and maintenance of effective control measures as
specified in 40 CFR 450.21(d) to minimize the discharge of pollutants. At a
minimum, such control measures must be designed, installed, implemented, and
maintained to:
            1.   Minimize the discharge of pollutants from equipment and
vehicle washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters. Wash waters must be
treated in a sediment basin or alternative control measure that provides
equivalent or better treatment prior to discharge;
            2.   Minimize the exposure of building materials, building
products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials, fertilizers,
pesticides, herbicides, detergents, sanitary waste, and other materials present
on the site to precipitation and to stormwater; and
            3.   Minimize the discharge of pollutants from spills and leaks and
implement chemical spill and leak prevention and response procedures.
         B.   The Pollution Prevention Plan shall include effective best
management practices to prohibit the following discharges in accordance with 40
CFR 450.21(e):
            1.   Wastewater from washout of concrete, unless managed by an
appropriate control measure;
            2.   Wastewater from washout and cleanout of stucco, paint, form
release oils, curing compounds, and other construction materials;
            3.   Fuels, oils, or other pollutants used in vehicle and equipment
operation and maintenance;
            4.   Soaps or solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing; and
            5.   Discharges from dewatering activities, including discharges
from dewatering of trenches and excavations, are prohibited unless managed by
appropriate controls in accordance with 40 CFR 450.21(c).
      (8)   Technical criteria; offsite options; grandfathering; variations.
         A.   To protect the quality and quantity of state water from the
potential harm of unmanaged stormwater runoff resulting from land-disturbing
activities, pursuant to the VESMA and VESMR, Loudoun County adopts minimum
technical criteria as set forth below:
            1.   The 19 Minimum Standards found in Section 9VAC25-875-560 of
VESMR.
            2.   The minimum standards and specifications for erosion control
practices in the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, subject to the
modifications set forth below:
               a.   Straw Bale Barrier and Brush Barrier. These control
measures shall not be used without specific authorization from the
Administrator, except as interim control measures during the first phase of
perimeter erosion and sediment control measures.
               b.   Level Spreader. This control measure shall not be used
without specific authorization from the Administrator.
               c.   Temporary Right-of-Way Diversion. The use of diversion
berms to break up drainage divides to support the use of sediment traps as
opposed to sediment basins shall not be allowed if such diversion berms inhibit
the constructability of the site.
               d.   Temporary Sediment Trap. A pipe outlet sediment trap shall
be required for drainage areas of one to three acres. Storage volume
calculations shall be based on 134 cubic yards per acre.
            3.   The Virginia Stormwater BMP Clearinghouse.

            2.   Notwithstanding Subsection 1., the use of offsite options to
meet phosphorus nutrient reductions required by the technical criteria shall be
allowed in in accordance with 9VAC25-875-610.B.2.
            3.   Where the first assessed watercourse downstream of a
development is characterized as impaired and there is no approved local TMDL,
the use of offsite options to meet nutrient reductions shall be limited in
accordance with 9VAC25-900-91.B.
         C.   Grandfathering to Part V Article 4 technical criteria:
            1.   Certain land-disturbing activity shall be considered
grandfathered by the Administrator and subject to the Part V Article 4 (9VAC25-
875-670 et seq.) as follows:
               a.   Land-disturbing activities pursuant to a proffered plan of
development, Special Exception, preliminary plat of subdivision, record plat,
construction plans and profiles, site plan, or any document determined by the
locality to be the equivalent thereto, shall remain subject to the Part V
Article 4 technical criteria for one additional VESMP Permit cycle, after which
any portions of the project not under construction shall become subject to the
technical criteria, provided the following are met:

                  iii.   Will comply with the Part V Article 4 technical
criteria;
                  iv.   Has not been subsequently modified or amended in a
manner resulting in an increase in the amount of phosphorus leaving each point
of discharge, and such that there is no increase in the volume or rate of
runoff;
                  v.   A General Permit was not issued prior to July 1, 2014;
and
                  vi.   Land disturbance did not commence prior to July 1,
2014.
               b.   Local, state, and federal projects shall remain subject to
Part V Article 4 technical criteria for one additional state permit cycle,
after which any portions of the project not under construction shall become
subject to the Technical Criteria, provided the following are met:
                  i.   There was an obligation of local, state, or federal
funding, in whole or in part, or DEQ approved a SWM Plan, prior to July 1,
2012; or
                  ii.   A General Permit was not issued prior to July 1, 2014;
and
                  iii.   Land disturbance did not commence prior to July 1,
2014.
               c.   Projects for which governmental bonding or public debt

or commenced land disturbance prior to July 1, 2014, shall remain subject to
the Part V Article 4 technical criteria for two additional State permit cycles,
after which any portions of the project not under construction shall become
subject to the Technical Criteria.
               e.   Land-disturbing activities that obtained a General Permit
or commenced land disturbance prior to July 1, 2014, and are treated by an
existing BMP that fully meets the Part II C technical criteria or that are part
of a comprehensive stormwater management design that fully meets the Part V
Article 4 technical criteria, shall remain subject to the Part V Article 4
technical criteria for two additional State permit cycles, after which any
portions of the project not under construction shall become subject to the
technical criteria.
            2.   Nothing in this section shall preclude an operator from
constructing to a more stringent standard at their discretion.
            3.   The Administrator has sole discretion to determine what
portions of a project are "not under construction".
         D.   Technical Criteria - Variations:
            1.   ESC design and site implementation. The Administrator may
grant variations to the technical requirements of Sections
1096.01(e)(8)A.1 and 2 that are deemed too restrictive for site conditions as
follows:
               a.   At the time of plan submission, an applicant may request a
variation to become part of the approved ESC Plan. The applicant shall explain
the reasons for requesting the variation in writing. Specific variations that
are granted by the Administrator shall be documented in the ESC Plan.
               b.   During construction, the person responsible for
implementing the approved ESC Plan may request a variation in writing from the
Administrator. The Administrator shall respond in writing either approving or
disapproving such a request. If the Administrator does not approve a variation
within 10 days of receipt of the request, the request shall be considered to be
disapproved. Following disapproval, the applicant may resubmit a variation
request with additional documentation.
            2.   Stormwater Management design and site implementation. The
Administrator may grant variations to the technical requirements of Section
1096.01(e)(8)A.4 under these conditions:
               a.   The variation is the minimum necessary to afford relief;
               b.   Written justification is provided by the Operator;
               c.   Reasonable and appropriate conditions are imposed so that
the intent of the VESMA, VESMR, and this Chapter are preserved;
               d.   If practicable, mitigation measures shall be required in
order to address the impacts of diverging from the technical criteria;
               e.   Granting the variation will not confer any special
privileges that are denied in other similar circumstances;
               f.   The variation request is not based upon conditions or
circumstances that are self-imposed or self-created. Economic hardship alone
shall not be a sufficient reason to grant a variation from the requirements of
this Chapter; and,
               g.   The variation is in keeping with established engineering
practices and procedures.
               h.   Variations to the requirement that the land-disturbing
activity obtain all required permits or that approve the use of a BMP not
listed under the Virginia Stormwater BMP Clearinghouse shall not be granted by
the Administrator except when allowed under Part V Article 4 (9VAC25-875-670 et
seq.).
               i.   Variations to requirements for phosphorus reductions shall
not be allowed unless offsite options otherwise permitted pursuant to 9VAC25-
875-610 and Section
1096.01(e)(8)B have been considered and found to be not available.
         E.   BMPs:
            1.   The Administrator shall not approve the use of a BMP that is
not listed on the Virginia Stormwater BMP Clearinghouse.
            2.   The Administrator may preclude the onsite use of a BMP listed
on the Virginia Stormwater BMP Clearinghouse, or require more stringent
conditions upon such BMP's use, for a specific land-disturbing project based on
a review of the SWM Plan and project site conditions. Such preclusion and/or
conditions shall be based on site-specific concerns.
               a.   Any project or site-specific determination purportedly
authorized pursuant to this subsection may be appealed to DEQ and DEQ shall
issue a written determination regarding compliance with this subsection to the
requesting party within 90 days of submission. Any such determination, or a
failure by DEQ to make any such determination within the 90-day period, may be
appealed to the State Water Control Board.
            3.   The Administrator may uniformly preclude jurisdiction-wide, or
otherwise limit geographically, the use of a BMP listed on the Virginia
Stormwater BMP Clearinghouse or apply more stringent conditions to the use of
such BMP in accordance with § 62.1-44.15:33 of the Code of Virginia.
         F.   Nothing in this section shall preclude an operator from
constructing to a more stringent standard at their discretion.

(Ord. 24-06. Passed 5-15-24.)
1096.04   ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Violations of Section
1096.01(e) through (f).
      (1)   Procedure. If the Administrator determines that there is a failure
to comply with the conditions of VESMP Permit and/or Land Disturbance/Grading
Permit approval, or if land-disturbing activities have commenced without an ESC
Plan, or SWM Plan if required, the following enforcement methodology shall be
pursued. Each day the violation is found to exist shall be a separate offense
for purposes of administrating the enforcement methodology.
         A.   First Notice to Comply. The Administrator may issue a First
Notice to Comply. The First Notice to Comply shall set forth the violation, the
actions necessary to remedy the violation, and the time period by which the
violation shall have been remedied. In any instance in which land-disturbing
activities have commenced without required Land Disturbance/Grading Permit
approval the Administrator may require immediate compliance. In any other case,
such time period shall take into account the following factors: i) risk of
damage and/or proximity to natural resources; ii) impacts to adjacent
properties; iii) nature, scale, scope, and/or duration of the violation; iv)
violation history; v) seasonal weather limitations; and vi) any other factors
that may pose harm to life, property, and/or water quality. The Administrator
may authorize extensions of such time period based upon the aforesaid factors.
         B.   Second Notice to Comply. If a violation has not been remedied
within the time period specified in the First Notice to Comply, including any
extensions authorized by the Administrator thereto, the Administrator may issue
a Second Notice to Comply. The Second Notice to Comply shall set forth the
violation, which may include any newly observed violations, the actions
necessary to remedy the violation, and the time period by which the violation
shall have been remedied. In any instance in which land-disturbing activities
have commenced without required Land Disturbance/Grading Permit approval the
Administrator may require immediate compliance. In any other case, such time
period shall take into account the factors listed in (a)(1)A above and also
failure to address the violation within the time period set forth in the First
Notice to Comply.
            1.   The Second Notice to Comply shall include a Consent Order that
shall be executed and returned to the Administrator within a time period set
forth under the Second Notice to Comply. Under the Consent Order the recipient
of the Notices to Comply shall agree to remedy the violation and pay any
associated civil penalties and/or charges assessed against them within the time
period set forth in the Second Notice to Comply.
         C.   Stop Work Orders and Emergency Stop Work Orders. Upon any
person's failure to remedy a violation within the time period specified in the
First Notice to Comply the Administrator shall notify the County Administrator,
or their designee, if the violation is ongoing. Upon receipt of such
notification the County Administrator, or their designee, may issue a Stop Work
Order. If not previously issued a Second Notice to Comply shall accompany the
Stop Work Order.
            1.   Where a violation is causing or presents an imminent and
substantial danger of causing harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition
in waters within the watersheds of the Commonwealth or otherwise substantially
impacting water quality, the County Administrator, or their designee, may issue
an Emergency Stop Work Order.
               a.   An Emergency Stop Work Order may be issued without first
issuing a Notice to Comply or providing any other advance notice or procedures,
however, if not previously issued a First Notice to Comply shall accompany the
Emergency Stop Work Order.
               b.   An Emergency Stop Work Order shall provide an opportunity
for the recipient to request a hearing before the County Administrator, or
their designee, to affirm, modify, amend, or cancel such Emergency Stop Work
Order. The County Administrator, or their designee, shall provide a recipient
requesting a hearing with reasonable notice of the time and place of such
requested hearing.
            2.   Stop Work Orders and Emergency Stop Work Orders shall require
the recipient to immediately cease all land-disturbing activities until the
violation has been remedied in accordance with the Notices to Comply, and
Consent Order has been returned to the Administrator if applicable. The
issuance of a Stop Work Order or Emergency Stop Work Order also shall authorize
the Administrator to:
               a.   Revoke any Land Disturbance/Grading Permit associated with
the violation. In the event of the revocation of a Land Disturbance/Grading
Permit the owner or applicant shall be required to apply for a new Land
Disturbance Grading Permit and re-submit any associated fees based on the
current Erosion Control Fee Schedule, and successfully pass site compliance
inspection before any land-disturbing activities can resume.
               b.   Enforce the terms of the associated financial guarantee of
performance and maintenance given by the permittee.
               c.   Order or recommend that any other permit or license issued
to the permittee, or to any other party, the activity to be performed under
which can properly be considered to be dependent on or substantially related to
the proper VESMP Permit and/or Land Disturbance/Grading Permit approval, be
revoked until such time as the violation has ceased. This provision shall be
deemed authority for any appropriate official of the County, or any town, where
appropriate, to revoke such other permit or license. Such other permits or
licenses shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, building permits,
zoning permits and clearances, health permits, and other land-disturbing
activity permits.
            3.   Stop Work Orders shall be rescinded immediately by the County
Administrator, or their designee, upon the Administrator's determination that
the violation has been remedied and any associated assessed civil penalties
and/or charges have been paid.
         D.   Civil Penalties. Any person who has been issued a Second Notice
to Comply may be subject to the following civil penalties:
            1.   For land-disturbing activity that disturbs an area measuring
one acre or more of land or is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale that disturbs one acre or more of land a civil penalty in the amount of
$2,500.00 for the first offense and $5,000.00 for each subsequent offense
thereafter shall be assessed. Violations subject to this section shall include
the following:
               a.   Commencement of a land disturbing activity without an

necessary to remedy the violation, and the time period by which the violation
shall have been remedied. In any instance in which a violation poses an
imminent harm to life, property, and/or water quality the Administrator may

            3.   The Administrator shall reduce all such civil penalties
assessed to the following civil charges if the violation is remedied, Consent
Order is returned, and such assessed civil charges are paid in accordance with
the applicable time period(s) set forth under the Second Notice to Comply:

   (b)   Any applicable charges for EMS transport rendered shall be billed
directly to the patient and/or to the patient's third party payer.
   (c)   All patients and/or their financially responsible parties, insurers or
carriers, will be billed for EMS transport provided by the system according to
the Fee Schedule established herein, and shall be responsible for any co-
payment or deductible amounts not satisfied by public or private insurance. The
third party billing agency shall make reasonable collection efforts for all
such balances according to the most current rules or regulations set forth in
applicable sections of the Medicare Carriers Manual and may seek reimbursement
from any applicable coinsurance carriers for such amounts.
   (d)   Any patient not billed on assignment by the County's billing agent and

   (a)   A detailed listing of patients who are transported and/or have
utilized emergency medical services will be compiled by the third party billing
agent, system EMS providers and/or the designated Program Manager. This
information will be transmitted to any third party billing agency selected by
DFREM to be responsible for reimbursement efforts. The information will,
however, be subject to the confidentiality requirements of applicable law.
   (b)   The fees established by the Board of Supervisors for system EMS
transports may be adjusted annually in accordance with the federally approved
Medicare Fee Schedule or the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as recommended by the
County Administrator in the annual budget proposal to the Board. Any change to
the fee schedule shall be approved by the Board and included in the adopted
appropriation resolution.
   (c)   The County Treasurer's Office will certify and provide the applicable
CPI of the EMS Transport Reimbursement Program to the designated Program
Manager and third party billing agency. The third party billing agency is to
notify the Program Manager and County Treasurer's Office in writing of all
applicable Medicare authorized increases; if no increases are applicable to the
County, then the Treasurer will validate any increases to the fee schedule for
the following County fiscal year.
(Ord. 14-02. Passed 1-15-14.)
1097.05   ADMINISTRATION OF EMS TRANSPORT REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM AND REVENUE
SHARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)   No local tax revenues are to be used to fund any EMS transport
reimbursement efforts. As such, the administrative costs, contractual
requirements and other necessary costs associated with conducting the program
will derive directly from the EMS transport reimbursement revenue and will be
paid first prior to any distribution.
   (b)   Revenues will be distributed with appropriate documentation for all
companies to review, audit, and dispute, if necessary. The Treasurer will
adjudicate all disputes as necessary. All disputes must be initiated and
provided to the designated Manager of EMS Transport Reimbursement Program
within thirty days of receipt of the quarterly distributions by the Volunteer
Fire and/or Rescue Company which believes there is an issue with the payment
received.
   (c)   The revenue distribution will be based on the following formula for
calculation of the shares for each of the Volunteer Fire and Rescue Companies
and DFREM:
      (1)   The totals of all payments received will be divided by the total
number of calls (minus all programmatic costs required to generate the revenue;
i.e. third party billing agency fees, administrative costs) and will result in
a net revenue-per-run.
      (2)   The net revenue-per-run will then be applied in the following
manner:
         A.   20% of the total net revenue will be disbursed to the Company or
DFREM which owns the apparatus used for the transport.
         B.   20% of the total net revenue will be disbursed to the Company or
DFREM that owns the Station for the call.
         C.   25% of the total net revenue will be disbursed to a Company or
DFREM that provided Staff for the transport; either BLS or ALS, and if
circumstances where two Companies responded, the Company staff that provided
the highest level of treatment during the transport will receive the payment.
         D.   25% of the total net revenue will be retained by the County for
the provision of Fire Rescue system infrastructure.
         E.   10% of the total net revenue will be provided to the "first-
responder" unit assigned to a call which supports EMS transporting units. If no
units are assigned for first response, then the 10% is contributed to a pool.
At the end of the Fiscal Year, this pool will be distributed by the County
Treasurer in equal shares to the Fire Companies that do not provide EMS
transports.
(Ord. 14-02. Passed 1-15-14.)

pertinent or advisable. In addition, all petitions must meet the requirements
of Title 15.2, Chapter 51, Article 6 of the Code of Virginia.

by this chapter and the ordinances that are adopted pursuant to this chapter,
except that clustered development at three-acre density leaving eighty percent

      (a)   Preliminary plat; vacation.
         1.   If the Director disapproves a preliminary plat of subdivision, or
if a subdivider objects to any condition imposed by the Director upon the
approval of a preliminary subdivision, or if the Director denies consent to a
proposed record plat vacation, and the subdivider contends that such
disapproval or denial or condition was not properly was not properly based upon

approval or denial.

         3.   The action of the Commission on the appeal shall be substituted
for the decision of the Director and shall be deemed final. Nothing herein
shall be interpreted to preclude the subdivider from pursuing an appeal to the

has been filed within the Court within sixty (60) days after the final action
of the Commission.

is filed with the Court within sixty (60) days after the written disapproval by

after filing of the written request for appeal by approving or disapproving
such plan. The Commission may delay its action on the request for appeal if the
applicant has submitted a written request for delay. In the event of
disapproval of a site plan, specific reasons for disapproval shall be set forth
in writing and shall identify deficiencies in the plan which cause the
disapproval by reference to specific duly adopted ordinances, regulations, or
policies, and shall generally identify such modifications or corrections as
will permit approval of the plan.
      (c)   When an applicant has elected to pursue an appeal of the Director's
decision on a site plan to the Commission, the action of the Commission shall
be substituted for the decision of the Director and shall be deemed final.
Nothing herein shall be interpreted to preclude the applicant from pursuing an
appeal of this final action of the Commission to the Circuit Court in
accordance with other provisions contained in this section, nor to preclude the
applicant from submitting a new site plan application for the same development
or property if no appeal is pending.
   (4)   Board of Zoning Appeals. An appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals, in
accordance with provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and Virginia Code Section

1243.03   BOUNDARY LINE ADJUSTMENT.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
1243.04 through
1243.13, inclusive, of this Ordinance, when the boundary lines of any legal lot
or parcel of record are proposed to be relocated, vacated or otherwise altered
without creation of any additional lot or parcel, the following provisions
shall apply:
   (1)   The Director shall waive the requirements of this Ordinance and the
Facilities Standards Manual and approve such boundary line adjustment (BLA) as
evidenced by his signature on a plat thereof so long as the following
conditions have been met:
      (a)   Such BLA shall not involve the relocation or alteration of streets,
alleys, easements for public passage, or other public areas; and no easements
or utility rights-of-way shall be relocated or altered without the express
consent of all persons holding any interest therein.
      (b)   Such BLA shall be clearly depicted upon an otherwise valid plat of
boundary line adjustment which shall be executed, acknowledged and recorded by
the owner or owners of such land as provided in Section 15.2-2264 of the
Virginia Code.
      (c)    Such BLA shall not result in any new violation of the area or
other dimensional requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, provided, however, that
any existing violation of minimum yard requirements or any existing non-
conformity in any non-conforming lot (as defined in the Zoning Ordinance) shall
be permitted to continue so long as such yard violation or non-conformity is
not enlarged, expanded or extended.
      (d)   With respect to each lot or parcel resulting from any such BLA, the
applicant shall satisfy one of the following two requirements:
         1.   Submit appropriate documentation to demonstrate in accordance
with
Chapter 1245 of this Ordinance, that such parcel has an approved source of
water and the capability of providing sanitary sewage service; or
         2.   Place a conspicuous note upon the plat, in substantially the
following form:
            The Loudoun County Health Department has not approved this lot for
water supply or sewage disposal. A certification from the Health Department
that such lots meet the requirements concerning water supply, sewage disposal
and well testing shall be required prior to any new construction in accordance
with the provisions of the Loudoun County Zoning Ordinance. This boundary line
adjustment shall not result in any off-site subsurface disposal field (e.g.,
drainfield) in violation of Section
1066.12(b) of the Loudoun County Codified Ordinances.
      (e)   Unless the titles to all parcels affected by the BLA are vested
identically in the same person or entity or the same combination of persons
and/or entities, a Deed shall be filed with the plat which makes clear that no
additional lot or parcel shall be created by the BLA.
   (2)   For the purposes of the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances of Loudoun
County, the lots or parcels resulting from any such boundary line adjustment
approved hereunder shall be considered as coming into existence as of the date
of recordation in the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Loudoun
County, Virginia, of the boundary line adjustment plat.
   (3)   The Director shall take action to approve or deny any boundary line
adjustment plat filed hereunder within twenty (20) business days (excluding
time that elapses awaiting applicant's response to County staff comments and
requirements) after such plat has been officially submitted.
   (4)   Any boundary line adjustment plat approved hereunder shall be recorded
by the applicant in the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Loudoun
County, Virginia, within six (6) months of the date of final approval, or it is
void.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)
1243.04   FAMILY SUBDIVISIONS.
   (1)   Permitted Divisions. A single division of a lot or parcel into no more
than six (6) additional lots for the purpose of sale or as a gift of each of
said lots to a member of the immediate family of the property owner is
permitted subject to the provisions of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended,
and the requirements of this Section
1243.04. No person who has previously received a conveyance of land as a
grantee under Section 15.2-2244, Section 15.1-466(A)(12) or (13) or Section
15.1-466(G) or any predecessor Section of the Code of Virginia, 1950, or any
local ordinance enacted pursuant thereto shall be eligible to be a grantee of a
lot or parcel created pursuant hereto. Any such division shall not be for the
purpose of circumventing this chapter or other chapters of the Loudoun County
Code. For the purpose of this section, "a member of the immediate family" is
defined as any natural person who is a natural or legally defined child,
stepchild, grandchild, spouse, brother, sister or parent of the property owner;
and "property owner" is defined as the natural person(s): (a) who is the sole
owner of the property; or (b) who is the:
      (a)   Sole owner of all stock or other documents of ownership of the
corporation, or
      (b)   Sole partner of the general partnership, or
      (c)   Sole managing partner of the limited partnership, or
      (d)   Sole member of the limited liability company, or
   sole trustee and sole beneficiary, with sole possession of any right of
revocation, of the trust, that is the sole owner of the property. Such
conveyance to a member of the immediate family may be made to such member and
his or her spouse if title is conveyed to them as tenants by the entirety.
   (2)   Approval by Director; Requirements. The Director shall have all
authority to approve such subdivision as evidenced by his signature on the
plat, provided the following requirements are met:
      (a)   All applicable requirements of the Zoning Ordinance shall be met.
      (b)   The proposed lot shall conform to applicable design standards set
forth in this Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual and to the
applicable Development Standards set forth in
Chapter 1245 of this Ordinance, provided, however, that the requirements of
Sections
1245.08 and
1245.10 to extend public water to all lots or to provide an approved location
on each lot for a well shall be waived if the plat contains a conspicuously
placed note substantially similar to either of the following:
         1.   “Note: The lots on this plat have NOT been tested or approved for
wells and there is no guarantee that an approvable well can be located on any
lot. No zoning permit or building permit will be issued for any lot until a
well has been approved for such lot by the Health Director.”
            or
         2.   “Note: The lots on this plat are required to be served by public
water. However, such service has NOT been extended to such lots. No zoning
permit or building permit will be issued for any lot until public water has
been extended to such lot in accordance with the regulations and specifications
of the Facilities Standards Manual and the Loudoun County Sanitation Authority
or other applicable Federal, State or local agency. The owner of each lot on
this plat shall grant, without compensation, such reasonable easements as are
necessary to permit such extension of public water to all lots.”
         If the public water note is required on the plat, then the deeds of
conveyance, or a separate deed of subdivision, must create and establish
appropriate easements to permit the future extension of public water to all
lots.
         The Director shall determine which of the foregoing notes shall be
required. If note 2. is chosen, the deed or deeds which subdivide or convey the
lots shall create and establish appropriate easements to permit the future
extension of public water to all lots.
      (c)   The plat shall be drawn with all plan and plat detail requirements
of this Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual.
      (d)   The property owner requesting such subdivision shall have held fee
simple title to the property to be subdivided for a period of more than one
year prior to the filing of the family subdivision application with the County.
      (e)   A fee is paid pursuant to Section
1242.12 of this Ordinance.
   (3)   Enforcement Provisions:
      (a)   The approved family subdivision plat and deed or deeds of sale or
gift filed as part of the family subdivision application and approved in
conjunction with the plat shall be recorded within six (6) months after the
date of approval of the plat by the Director. Such approval shall automatically
terminate with respect to any such family subdivision plat if such approved
plat and approved deed or deeds of sale or gift have not been recorded within
such six (6) months and, thereafter, such plat shall be null and void. A note
to this effect must be placed conspicuously upon the family subdivision plat
before it may be approved.
      (b)   If a family subdivision grantee conveys a lot or parcel received
pursuant to an approved family subdivision within one (1) year after the date
of approval of the family subdivision plat, such family subdivision grantee
shall be presumed to have intended at the time of the approval of the family
subdivision to circumvent this chapter or other chapters of the Loudoun County
Code. Such conveyance shall entitle the Director to take any reasonable actions
necessary to ameliorate the effect of such circumvention, including without
limitation recommending to the Board of Supervisors the adoption of an
ordinance vacating said subdivision in whole or in part as provided in Section
15.2-2272 of the Code of Virginia. A note to this effect must be placed
conspicuously upon the family subdivision plat before it may be approved. This
paragraph shall not apply to a conveyance made to secure an obligation nor
pursuant to the foreclosure of a lien provided the recordation of such lien
against such lot or parcel occurs after the recordation required by paragraph
(a) above, nor shall it apply to the lot or parcel retained by the subdivider.
      (c)   No zoning permit nor building permit shall be issued for any lot or
parcel with respect to which any of the foregoing provisions of this Section
1243.04 has been violated unless and until correction of such violation has
been accomplished to the satisfaction of the Director. No zoning permit nor
building permit shall be issued for any lot or parcel created pursuant to a
family subdivision plat unless evidence of the required recordations has been
supplied to the Department.
      (d)   Upon satisfactory evidence of a conveyance as described in
paragraph (b) above or other action constituting a circumvention or violation
of any provision of this Ordinance, the Board of Supervisors may adopt an
ordinance vacating in whole or in part any such family subdivision plat in
accordance with Section 15.2-2272 of the Code of Virginia.
   (4)   Intent. It is the intent of this Ordinance that no application for
further subdivision of any lot or parcel created and conveyed pursuant hereto
shall be filed within one (1) year after the date of approval of the family
subdivision plat.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00; Ord. 06-16. Passed 12-5-06.)
1243.05.1    WAIVER GENERALLY.
   (1)   Where a single lot or parcel of land is to be subdivided into any two
parcels, the Director may waive any and all of the requirements of this
Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual, and approve the subdivision, as
evidenced by his signature on the plat, as long as the following conditions are
met:
      (a)   All applicable requirements of the Zoning Ordinance shall be met.
      (b)    No such lot or parcel created hereunder shall be eligible for
further subdivision under this Section
1243.05.1 for a period of one (1) year after approval.
   (2)   The Director shall not process such subdivision waiver application if
any of the following conditions are found to be in existence:
      (a)    Conflict with the governing Comprehensive Plan.
      (b)    Bond requirements for public improvements requiring Board of
Supervisors' action.
      (c)    Conflict with an approved concept development plan.
   (3)   The Director shall state, in writing, within twenty (20) days of
official submission of the subdivision application, the reasons for not
processing such application. (Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)
1243.05.2 LOW DENSITY DEVELOPMENT WAIVER. (REPEALED)
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Section 1243.05.2 was repealed by Ordinance 24-14, passed
December 11, 2024.)
1243.06   PRELIMINARY PLAT OF SUBDIVISION.
   (1)    Preliminary plats or preliminary/record plats shall be submitted for
all subdivisions.
   (2)    Preliminary plats and supporting data shall comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual.
   (3)    Blue-line or black-line prints shall be submitted to the Director.
   (4)    The Director shall review the preliminary plat within ten (10)
working days to determine if it is in substantial conformance with the
application requirements of the Facilities Standards Manual, the Zoning
Ordinance and this Ordinance. If in accordance, then the plat is accepted for
processing and so noted on the plat. Upon making a determination that all
documents are in order, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to be officially
submitted.
      The date of this determination shall be deemed the filing date for the
preliminary plat. If it is not accepted, the reasons shall be submitted, in
writing, to the applicant within ten (10) working days. The Director's
determination that the plat qualifies to be officially submitted shall not be
deemed a determination that the plat meets requirements for approval.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)
1243.07   STAFF REVIEW.
   (1)   Copies of the preliminary plat may be distributed to the following
agencies:
      (a)    County Boards, Commissions, and Departments.
      (b)    State or Federal Boards, Commissions, and Departments.
      (c)    Incorporated municipalities within one (1) mile of the proposed
subdivision.
      (d)   Affected public utilities and franchise cable operators.
   (2)    If the Director has determined that there is no need to distribute
the preliminary plat to a State agency for its approval, the review by the
above-mentioned agencies shall be completed and returned to the Director within
thirty (30) days of the date on which the preliminary plat was officially
submitted.
   (3)    If the Director has determined that the preliminary plat requires
approval by a State agency, the review by the above-mentioned agencies shall be
completed and returned to the Director within forty-five (45) days of the date
on which the preliminary plat was officially submitted.
   (4)    The Director shall review the agencies' comments and determine
whether revised plats or additional information are required for proper review
by the Director. At such time that the Director determines that sufficient
response has been received from the agencies, referral responses and County
comments will be prepared and sent to the applicant. The applicant shall have
the option of revising his application after reviewing the referral responses
and County comments. The Director shall determine whether the revision is so
substantive as to render the application an amended application, based upon his
opinion that additional substantive review of the application as revised is
required by one or more agencies. If so, the date on which the amended
application is submitted shall thereafter be deemed the filing date or the date
on which the application was officially submitted for timeline purposes.
   (5)   Once an application has been submitted for preliminary plat approval,
any preliminary plat filed thereafter for the same property while the initial
application is still pending shall be deemed a withdrawal of the initial
application provided, however, that this paragraph shall not apply where the
subsequently filed plat proposes only a further subdividing of the lots or
parcels proposed in the initial application. Any such subsequently filed plat
may not be approved until the initial application has been approved or
withdrawn.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)
1243.08   ACTION ON PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (1)    (a)   The Director shall act on any proposed preliminary plat and/or
plats within ninety (90) days after the date on which the preliminary plat was
officially submitted. The Director may delay his action on a preliminary plat
or plats beyond such time limits if the applicant has submitted a written
request for a delay. The Director shall act on a preliminary plat or plats by
either approving, conditionally approving, or disapproving such plat or plats,
in writing, transmitted to the applicant by certified mail and giving with the
latter specific reasons therefor. The Director shall approve such preliminary
plat provided that the requirements and provisions of this Ordinance, the
facilities Standards Manual, and other applicable Ordinances have been met.
Approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall constitute
approval of the subdivision. Specific reasons for disapproval may be contained
in a separate document or may be written on the plat itself and shall relate,
in general terms, such modifications or corrections as will permit approval of
the plat. The subdivider shall be advised by the Department in writing as to
the decision of the Director within five (5) working days after the decision. A
disapproval of the plat may be appealed to the Planning Commission in
accordance with the provisions of Section
1242.04. Nothing herein shall be interpreted so as to preclude the subdivider
from filing a new preliminary plat of subdivision for the same property if no
appeal to the Circuit Court is pending.
      (b)   If a subdivider objects to any condition imposed by the Director
upon the approval of a preliminary plat, such conditional approval may be
deemed a disapproval which may be appealed to the Planning Commission in
accordance with the provisions of Section
1242.04.
   (2)    After approval or conditional approval of a preliminary plat, a
record plat application may be officially submitted within two (2) years,
hereafter called the initial approval period, after the date of such action. If
no record plat is eligible to be officially submitted within such time,
approval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat shall become void.
   (3)    Extensions of up to one (1) year each, provided that the total of all
such extensions shall not exceed an aggregate of three (3) years beyond the
initial approval period established in the preceding paragraph, may be granted
by the Director, as provided in this paragraph (3), upon the written
justification of the subdivider. The procedure for the request, review and
grant or denial of an extension of a preliminary plat shall be as follows:
      (a)   The subdivider shall submit its written request for extension along
with payment of the appropriate fees as established by the Board of Supervisors
to the Director at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the end of the initial
approval period or current extension period, whichever applies.
      (b)   The Director shall review the request and the reasons supplied by
the subdivider. The factors considered by the Director shall include the
following:
         1.   Whether the subdivider has agreed in writing that all future
submissions of construction plans and profiles, subdivision plats and site
plans for the subject application (hereinafter collectively referred to as
plans) shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the
Official Zoning Maps, the Land Subdivision Development Ordinance, and the
Facilities Standards Manual in effect as of the date of the granting of such
extension (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Ordinance”).
         2.   Whether compliance of the plans with the Ordinance is feasible
without rendering the record plat no longer capable of substantial conformance
with the approved preliminary plat and the conditions, if any, imposed at the
time of such approval.
      (c)   The Director shall take action to approve or disapprove such
extension request within twenty-one (21) days after submission thereof,
provided that no such action shall be required to be taken more than forty-five
(45) days prior to the date upon which such preliminary plat would become void.
If, within the said twenty-one (21) days and before the Director has taken any
such action, the Initial Approval Period or current extension period expires,
then the preliminary plat shall become void and the Director shall not be
required to take any further action. Disapproval of such extension request
shall be in writing by certified mail with return receipt requested stating the
specific reasons therefor. The failure or inability of the subdivider to
satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)1. and (b)2. hereof shall be a
sufficient basis for denial of the extension request.
      (d)   The subdivider may appeal a disapproval to the Planning Commission
by submitting within five (5) working days of receipt of such written
disapproval a written notice of appeal to the Director along with payment of
the appropriate fee as established by the Board of Supervisors. The Director
shall promptly schedule the matter for the next available Planning Commission
meeting, allowing a reasonable amount of time for the Director and the
subdivider to prepare for such meeting, provided that the matter shall be
presented to the Commission for decision prior to the date upon which the
preliminary plat would become void. The Planning Commission, whether hearing
the request on appeal or upon a direct submission, as provided for in paragraph
(a) hereof, shall consider the factors set forth in paragraphs (b)1. and (b)2.
hereof. Failure or inability of the subdivider to satisfy the requirements of
paragraphs (b)1. and (b)2. hereof shall be a sufficient basis for denial of
this extension request.
      (e)   In no event shall any extension request be granted which would
extend the validity of any preliminary plat to a date more than five (5) years
after the date of the original approval or conditional approval of said plan.
   (4)   If a subdivider has (a) obtained approval of a preliminary plat of a
proposed subdivision and (b) submitted within two (2) years of preliminary plat
approval, or any extended period as approved by the Director under Section
1243.08(3), a record plat meeting the submission requirements of this Ordinance
for a portion of the lots shown on the preliminary plat, then the subdivider
may submit record plats for remaining portions shown on the approved
preliminary plat within five (5) years of the date of recordation of the record
plat for the first recorded portion, or within such longer period as the
Director may, at the time of preliminary plat approval, determine to be
reasonable, taking into consideration the size and phasing of the proposed
development which such longer period shall be specifically set forth as a
condition of the approval of the preliminary plat, provided, however, that no
record plat for any portion of the lots on an approved preliminary plat shall
be approved unless such record plat is in conformance with the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance, the Official Zoning Maps, the Land Subdivision and
Development Ordinance, and the Facilities Standards Manual in effect at the
time it is submitted for approval.
   (5)   Once the time limit of approval for a preliminary plat expires, a new
submission and payment of all fees are required.
   (6)   Approval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat shall not
obligate the Director to approve the record plat, unless it is in conformance
with the preliminary plat, the Zoning Ordinance, and the standards of this
Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual, and nothing has come to the
attention of the Director subsequent to approval or conditional approval of the
preliminary plat which is materially adverse or contrary to the requirements or
purpose of these regulations.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)
1243.09   PRELIMINARY/RECORD PLAT.
   A preliminary/record plat may be submitted for subdivisions of five (5) lots
or less. Such preliminary/record plat shall be designed in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual and shall
contain all required detail as specified for both a preliminary plan of
subdivision and a record plat. All documents that are required by this
Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual for a preliminary plan of
subdivision and a record plat shall be submitted.
   The review and approval procedure for a preliminary/record plat shall follow
that of a record plat, as specified in this Ordinance.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)
1243.10   CONSTRUCTION PLANS AND PROFILES.
   (1)   Subsequent to approval or conditional approval on the preliminary plat
and prior to the submission of the record plat, the subdivider shall submit
copies of the construction plans and profiles when public improvements are
required by this or other applicable County ordinances; provided, however, that
the subdivider may submit the construction plans and profiles subsequent to the
first submission comments transmitted by the Director to the applicant
regarding the preliminary plat. This paragraph shall not apply to construction
plans and profiles submitted pursuant to Section
1243.11 Dedication Plats.
   (2)   Copies shall be submitted to the Director, who in turn shall
distribute them within the Department. The subdivider shall submit a copy of
the construction plans and profiles directly to the Loudoun County Sanitation
Authority.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00; Ord. 05-05. Passed 6-16-05; Ord. 24-14. Passed 12-
11-24.)
1243.11   DEDICATION PLATS.
   When the purpose of a plat is to dedicate land for public street purposes
only, and such plat does not create any additional lot or lots of record, the
subdivider may submit a Dedication Plat to create such public street under the
following circumstances and in accordance with the following procedures:
   (1)   Such plat shall dedicate for public street purposes:
      (a)   Additional right-of-way for an existing road in the state system;
or
      (b)   A street (or streets) identified in the Comprehensive Plan; or
      (c)   A street (or streets) identified in approved proffers or on an
approved special exception plat or Concept Development Plan, and
         (i)   Having a projected traffic volume of not less than 4,000
vehicles per day (“VPD”); or
         (ii)   As otherwise approved by the Director.
   (2)   Such plat may be submitted subsequent to, or concurrently with, the
Construction Plans and Profiles for the street(s) dedicated on the plat.
   (3)   Such plat shall comply with all of the requirements of the Facilities
Standards Manual for plats except that no preliminary subdivision plat shall be
required, provided, however, that any action required by any applicable proffer
or special exception condition to have been performed in conjunction with the
preliminary plat for such street shall be required in conjunction with such
Dedication Plat.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00; Ord. 05-05. Passed 6-16-05.)
1243.12   RECORD PLAT.
   (1)    After approval or conditional approval of the preliminary plat, any
subdivider who proposes to record a plat of the subdivision approved or
conditionally approved on the preliminary plat shall submit paper copies of the
record plat to the Director for staff review along with all other documents, as
specified in this Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual. The Director
may require additional copies of the record plat as necessary at any time
during the processing of the application.
   (2)    (a)    Upon receipt of the record plats and all required documents as
specified in this Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual, the Director
shall determine, within five (5) working days, if the record plats and
documents comply with all applicable rules and regulations relating to the
submission of a record plat application for processing and review.
   Except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter for preliminary/
record plats, the Director shall not accept a record plat unless there is a
preliminary plat for the same property which has been approved or conditionally
approved by the Director and which remains valid pursuant to the limitations of
Section
1243.08. Upon acceptance of record plats and documents, the Director shall
forward said plats and documents to the affected agencies.
      (b)   Upon acceptance of the documents and record plat, the application
shall be deemed to be officially submitted, and the date upon which such
determination is noted in the official records of the Department shall be
deemed the filing date for the record plat.
      (c)   If it is not accepted, the reasons for not accepting the record
plat for processing shall be indicated in writing, the record plat and
documents shall be returned to the subdivider with a full refund of any fees
rendered, and no review of the record plat shall be conducted.
      (d)   The Director's determination that the record plat qualifies to be
officially submitted shall not be deemed a determination that the record plat
meets requirements for approval, which approval may only be given by the
Director subject to the standards provided in this section after the procedural
requirements of this Ordinance for review and responsive comment have been met.
      (e)   Once an application has been submitted for record plat approval,
any record plat application filed thereafter for the same property while the
initial application is still pending shall be deemed withdrawal of the initial
application.
   (3)    (a)   Within sixty (60) days after the filing date of the record plat
and plans, and after the submission of copies of the record plat, and the
compliance with all other requirements, the Director shall approve such record
plats, pursuant to Section 15.2-2259 of the Code of Virginia, such approval to
be evidenced by the signature of the Director on the record plat, provided
that:
         (1)   The record plat is in substantial conformance with the approved
preliminary plat, including the character and proposed layout depicted thereon
and any and all conditions imposed by the Director upon the approval of the
preliminary plat, and is in conformance with the requirements and provisions of
this Ordinance and all other applicable County ordinances and laws; and
         (2)   A letter is signed by the Director that all construction plans
and profiles for all public improvements are designed in accordance with the
Facilities Standards Manual.
      (b)    If such conditions are not met, the Director shall not approve
such record plats. Written reasons for such disapproval shall identify
deficiencies in the record plats which cause the disapproval by reference to
specific duly adopted ordinances, regulations, or policies and shall generally
identify such modifications or corrections as will permit approval of the plat.
A disapproval may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of Section
1242.04. Nothing herein shall be interpreted so as to preclude the filing of a
new record plat application for the same property if no appeal is pending and
if the corresponding preliminary plat remains valid pursuant to the limitations
of Section
1243.08.
   (4)    The Director shall not release an approved record plat and approval
of the record plat shall not be deemed final until all required agreements and
surety relating to the record plat have been submitted, approved, and executed
in accordance with the Bonding Policy in effect at the time the record plat is
approved.
   (5)    An approved record plat shall be recorded by the subdivider in the
Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Loudoun County within six (6)
months of the date of final approval, or it is void.
   (6)    Prior to approval of the record plat, the subdivider shall submit a
request for assignment of addresses as provided in the Facilities Standards
Manual, Chapter 7, as amended.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)
1243.13   EXCEPTION PROCEDURES.
   (1)   Upon application to the Board of Supervisors, a subdivider may request
an exception to the substantive regulations contained in the Facilities
Standards Manual or in
Chapter 1245 of these Subdivision Regulations. The Board of Supervisors may
grant such an exception upon evidence presented by the subdivider that an
exception is warranted due to an unusual situation or that strict adherence to
general requirements would result in substantial injustice or hardship.
   (2)   No exception shall be granted by the Board of Supervisors that it
finds would:
      (a)   Be in conflict with the governing Comprehensive Plan;
      (b)   Be in conflict with the applicable requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance.
      Further, no exception granted pursuant to this section shall affect the
subdivider's obligation to comply with requirements which are established by
separate authority in accordance with State or County law, nor may any
exception to Section
1245.13 relating to agreements and surety be granted pursuant to this section.
   (3)   Applications for exceptions shall be made to the Board of Supervisors
prior to submittal of the record plat.
   (4)   The Board of Supervisors shall give notice of a public hearing to
consider an application for an exception. Such notice and hearing shall be done
in conformance with Section 15.2-2204 of the Code of Virginia.
      In addition, each application shall be posted by the applicant, using a
form of placard approved by the Board of Supervisors, at least twenty-one (21)
and no more than thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing. Certification of
posting shall be provided to the Director prior to the public hearing.
      Placards shall be affixed to a pole, post, fence or other structure to be
clearly visible from each public road abutting the property. If no public roads
abut the property, then the placard shall be posted so as to be clearly visible
from at least two (2) abutting properties and at access points to said
property. Placards shall be weatherproof.
      Placards shall contain:
      (a)   The time, date and place of the hearing;
      (b)   A brief description of the matter being heard; and
      (c)   Identification of the land that is the subject of the application,
including the tax map number and complete address of the property.
      The applicant shall maintain all placards up to the time of the public
hearing and shall remove all posted placards no later than fifteen (15) days
after the public hearing has been closed.
      It shall be unlawful for any person to destroy, deface or remove such
placard notice. Any person taking such action shall be subject to enforcement
as set forth under the Zoning Ordinance.
   (5)   The Board of Supervisors shall act upon such application within ninety
(90) days from the date the application was officially submitted and shall
adopt written findings of fact supporting its decision regarding the approval
of each request for an exception.

1244.01 APPLICABILITY OF SITE PLAN REGULATIONS.
   A Site Plan shall be required in accordance with the Loudoun County Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00; Ord. 24-14. Passed 12-11-24.)
1244.02 SITE PLAN.
   (1)   The developer shall submit paper copies of the site plan to the
Director for staff review along with all other documents specified in this
Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual. The Director may require a
greater or fewer number of copies of the site plan as it determines to be
appropriate.
   (2)   (a) Upon receipt of the site plans and all documents and requirements
specified in this Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual, the Director
shall determine, within five (5) working days, if the site plan and documents
comply with all applicable rules and regulations. If all plans and documents
are in order, the Director shall forward said plans and documents to the
Virginia Department of Transportation, and other affected agencies. Upon making
a determination that all documents are in order, the site plan shall be deemed
to be officially submitted and the date of such official submittal shall
establish the filing date. The Director's determination that a site plan
application qualifies to be officially submitted shall not be deemed a
determination that the plan meets requirements for approval, which approval may
only be given by the Director subject to the standards set forth in this
section after the procedural requirements for review and responsive comment
have been met.
      (b)   Once an application for site plan approval has been submitted, any
site plan application submitted thereafter for the same property while the
initial application is still pending shall be deemed withdrawal of the initial
application.
   (3)   (a)   Within sixty (60) days after the acceptance of the site plan,
the Director shall approve such site plan, to be evidenced by his signature on
the site plan, provided that the requirements and provisions of this Ordinance,
the Facilities Standards Manual, and all other applicable ordinances shall be
met.
      (b)   If such requirements are not met, the Director shall not approve
such site plan. Specific reasons for disapproval shall be set forth in writing
and shall identify deficiencies in the plan which cause the disapproval by
reference to specific duly adopted ordinances, regulations or policies, and
shall generally identify such modifications or corrections as will permit
approval of the plan. A disapproval may be appealed to the Planning Commission
in accordance with the provisions of Section
1242.04(3). Nothing herein shall be interpreted so as to preclude the filing of
a new site plan for the same development or property if no such appeal is
pending.
   (4)   After approval of a site plan, construction shall begin within five
(5) years, or the site plan is void. Construction shall be defined as to
include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and
fastened in a permanent manner and work carried on diligently. Where excavation
or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun
prior to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed
to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
   (5)   An extension of the validity of the site plan may be made on a yearly
basis by the Director upon the written request of the developer. The reasons
for this request must be stated. The Director may deny the request if the
reasons submitted with the request do not demonstrate that development, in
accordance with the approved site plan, has been diligently pursued. In
conjunction with the request for any extension, the site plan shall be reviewed
for conformance with all current regulations contained in the Subdivision
Ordinance, the Facilities Standards Manual, and the Zoning Ordinance at the
time such review is undertaken. No extension shall be granted until any non-
conformance is corrected.
   (6)   Prior to approval of the site plan and any related performance
agreements and surety, the developer shall submit a request for assignment of
addresses as provided in the Codified Ordinances of Loudoun County, as amended.
Zoning and building permits shall be issued in accordance with the approved
site plan following the assignment of addresses.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)
1244.03 SITE PLAN AMENDMENT.
   (1)   The developer shall submit paper copies of the amended site plan to
the Director for staff review along with all other documents specified in this
Ordinance and the Facilities Standards Manual. The Department may require a
greater or fewer number of copies of the amended site plan as it determines to
be appropriate.
   (2)   (a)   Upon receipt of the amended site plans, construction plans and
all documents and requirements specified in this Ordinance and the Facilities
Standards Manual, the Director shall determine, within five (5) working days,
whether the amended site plan and documents comply with all applicable rules
and regulations. If all plans and documents are in order, the amended site plan
shall be deemed to be officially submitted, and the date of such official
submittal shall establish the filing date. The Director's determination that an
amended site plan application qualifies to be officially submitted shall not be
deemed approval, which approval may only be given by the Director subject to
the standards set forth in this section after the procedural requirements for
review and responsive comments have been met.
      (b)   Once an application for an amended site plan approval has been
submitted, any site plan application submitted thereafter for the same property
while the initial application is still pending shall be deemed withdrawal of
the initial application.
   (3)   (a)   Within thirty (30) days after official submittal of the amended
site plan, the Director shall approve such plan to be evidenced by his
signature on the amended site plan, provided that the requirements and
provisions of this Ordinance, the Facilities Standards Manual and all other
applicable ordinances have been met.
      (b)   If such requirements are not met, the Director shall not approve
such amended site plan. Specific reasons for disapproval shall be set forth in
writing and shall identify deficiencies in the plan which cause the disapproval
by reference to specific duly adopted ordinances, regulations or policies, and
shall generally identify such modifications or corrections as will permit
approval of the plan. A disapproval may be appealed to the Planning Commission
in accordance with the provisions of Section
1242.04(3). Nothing herein shall be interpreted so as to preclude the filing of
a new amended site plan for the same development or property if no such appeal
is pending.
   (4)   If the amended site plan proposes alteration of an existing structure,
construction shall begin within one (1) year or the amendment to the site plan
is void. If the amended site plan is proposed to amend a currently valid
approved site plan which construction has not yet been completed, the validity
of the amended site plan shall be for the same period of time as the originally
approved plan. The approved site plan amendment shall be deemed to merge with
the original approved site plan, and that plan as amended shall be deemed the
final site plan, and shall be subject to the provisions of Section
1244.02 of this Ordinance. "Construction" shall be defined as including the
placing of construction and materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner and work carried on diligently. Where excavation or demolition
or removal of an existing building has begun prior to rebuilding, such
excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction,
provided that the work shall be carried on diligently.
   (5)   Prior to the approval of the site plan amendment and any related
performance agreements and surety, the developer shall submit a request for
assignment of addresses as provided in the Codified Ordinances of Loudoun
County, as amended. Zoning and building permits shall be issued in accordance
with the approved amended site plan following the assignment of addresses, if
applicable.

the recorded Declaration achieves the purposes of this Ordinance and complies
with any applicable design requirements of the Facilities Standards Manual. The
failure of any such franchised cable television operator to agree to the terms
and conditions set out in such Declaration shall not defeat or impair any such

   Any proposed lots which have been completely tested and do not meet Health
Department requirements may be approved with a note similar to the following
placed on the plat:
      “NOTE: This lot is not considered to be approved as a building lot as it
is unsuitable for the installation of an on site sewage disposal system and/or
individual water supply under the current standards of the Loudoun County
Health Department.”
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00; Ord. 06-16. Passed 12-5-06.)

the completed record drawings. Such shall be submitted at least one (1) week
prior to the anticipated occupancy of any building for the review and approval
by the Director for conformance with the approved site plan and the ordinances
and regulations of the County and State agencies.
   The approval of the final site plan or the installation of the improvements
as required in this Ordinance shall in no case serve to bind the County to
accept such improvements for maintenance, repair or operation thereof. Such
acceptance shall be subject to the County and/or State regulations, where
applicable, concerning the acceptance of each type of improvement.
   The final bond shall not be released until after the approval of the record
drawings plan.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 4-29-00.)

   (a)   The ADUAB shall initially and semiannually thereafter establish the
County-wide sale control prices of ADUs (“ADU sale control price”). The ADU
sale control price shall:
      (1)   Account for fluctuations in the market; and
      (2)   Be adjusted according to the percentage change in the various cost
elements as indicated by the Means Construction Cost Index, or other equivalent
index should the Means Index be discontinued, or as may be selected by the
ADUAB upon approval of the Board.
   (b)   ADU sale control price shall be based upon a determination of all
ordinary, necessary and reasonable hard and soft costs required to construct
and market the ADUs by private industry in the immediate area, including the
area's current general market and economic conditions.
      (1)   ADU sale control price shall include, among other costs, provisions
for builder-paid permanent mortgage placement costs, closing costs, except for
pre-paid expenses at settlement, and other applicable costs resulting from
proffers given and accepted through a rezoning approval.
      (2)   ADU sale control price shall not include the cost of land,
marketing expenses and extra finishes and amenities exceeding ten percent of
the total unit construction cost, including landscaping, unless otherwise
approved by the ADUAB.
      (3)   In the event there is a real estate agent who secures a certified
purchaser for an ADU, the ADU sale control price shall include a 1.5 percent
sales commission/finders fee to be paid to such real estate agent. ADUAB may,
when necessary due to market conditions in the County, revise the 1.5 percent
sales commission/finder’s fee to another reasonable percentage.
      (4)   In the event that the developer or builder is responsible for
conducting a lottery to identify potential certified purchasers, the ADU sale
control price may include a flat fee, to be determined by the ADUAB, to cover
such costs.
   (c)   The ADU sale control price of ADUs within a development shall be
established such that the owner shall not suffer economic loss as a result of
providing the required ADUs. Economic loss shall result when the owner or
applicant of a development that contains ADUs fails to recoup the cost of
construction, including site development and infrastructure costs, and those
allowances as may be determined by the ADUAB upon the sale of an ADU, exclusive
of the cost of land acquisition and those costs voluntarily incurred.

1450.07   RENTAL CONTROL PRICE OF AFFORDABLE DWELLING UNITS (ADUs).
   (a)   The ADUAB shall initially and semiannually thereafter establish the
County-wide rental control price of ADUs (“ADU rental control price”). ADU
rental control price shall be established according to the Washington
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) median income as published by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and/or such other indices that
reflect the cost of rental housing in the County as selected by the ADUAB.
   (b)   ADU rental control prices shall be based upon a determination of all
ordinary, necessary and reasonable costs required to construct and market the
required number of rental ADUs by private industry in the area, including the
area's current general market and economic conditions. The process for
establishing the ADU rental control price will be determined by the ADUAB. The
ADUAB will determine and recommend those costs to be included within the ADU
rental control price and those costs to be excluded. In establishing ADU rental
control price, consideration shall be given to reasonable and customary
allowances in the rental industry for construction, financing and operating
costs per unit.
   (c)   ADU rental control price shall be established such that the owner/
landlord shall not suffer economic loss as a result of providing rental ADUs.

such project or development for the twenty-year control period. Upon the non-
judicial foreclosure sale of a project or development containing rental ADUs,
all restrictions imposed by the ADU covenants and this chapter will

adjusted ADU sale control price defined in sub-section (a)(1)(A) below.
However, for any ADU that is owned by the same certified purchaser for the
entire ADU thirty-year control period or the entire Renewable ADU thirty-year
control period, after the termination of the ADU thirty-year control period or
the Renewable ADU thirty-year control period, as applicable, the ADU sale
control price shall terminate and the ADU may be sold in accordance with sub-
section (a)(4) and (a)(5) hereof.
         A.   During the ADU thirty-year control period and any Renewable ADU
thirty-year control period, such ADU shall not be the subject of a resale for
an amount that exceeds the ADU sale control price determined by the ADUAB as
adjusted in accordance with sub-section (a)(3) hereof (“Adjusted ADU Sale
Control Price”).
         B.   Each time the ADU may be offered for resale, it must first be
offered exclusively to certified purchasers through the Board, and then to the
Board or its designee who may include a qualified non-profit, at Board’s
discretion, for a period of forty-five days in accordance with sub-section (a)
(2) hereof. An additional thirty days shall be allowed for settlement.
         C.   The ADU covenants shall provide that the ADU is subject to the
provisions of the ADU Program, as set forth in this chapter and Chapter 9 of

County pursuant to this chapter shall be senior to all covenants, liens,
mortgages, deeds of trust or other financing instruments secured by such ADU,
that may be recorded after the ADU covenants, and shall be binding upon all
assignees, lien holders, trustees, mortgagees, purchasers and other successors
in interest.
         E.   Any lender, lien holder, or trustee, as applicable, shall provide
to the Board or its designee written notice of any delinquency or other event
of default under a mortgage, lien, deed of trust or any other financing

default, although the Board shall have no obligation to cure the default.
         F.   The total aggregate amount of principal of all financing
instruments secured by an ADU shall not exceed the adjusted ADU sale control

price shall not be secured by any interest in the applicable ADU.
      (2)   At least forty-five days prior to an ADU being offered for resale,
such ADU shall first be offered exclusively to certified purchasers through the
Board, and then to the Board or its designee who may include a qualified non-
profit, at Board’s discretion. The forty-five-day resale period shall begin
upon the Board’s receipt of written notice, sent by registered or certified
mail that an ADU is available for resale. The written notice shall include the
address and the parcel identification number of the ADU. An additional thirty-
days shall be allowed for settlement.
         A.   Repealed.
         B.   Upon the expiration of the forty-five-day period, if neither a
certified purchaser nor the Board or its designee, has elected to purchase the
ADU, such ADU may be offered to members of the general public at fair market
value, provided that the difference between the actual resale price of the ADU
and the adjusted ADU sale control price shall be divided equally between the
seller and the County Housing Trust.
      (3)   Units offered for resale during the ADU thirty-year control period
or a Renewable ADU thirty-year control period shall not be offered for a price
that exceeds the ADU sale control price determined by the ADUAB plus the
following:
         A.   A percentage of the ADU sale control price determined by the
ADUAB equal to the increase in the Consumer Price Index-For All Urban Consumers
calculated as of the date of the resale;
         B.   The current fair market value of those home improvements, as
determined to be eligible to be added to the selling price of ADUs by the
ADUAB, made to the ADU between the date of the initial sale and the date of
resale;
         C.   An allowance for payment of closing costs, on behalf of the
purchaser, which shall be paid by the seller; and
         D.   An allowance for the payment of up to 1.5 percent sales
commission/finder’s fee to be paid to a real estate agent, if any, who secures
a purchaser for the ADU. ADUAB may, when necessary due to change in the market
conditions in the County, revise the 1.5 percent sales commission/finder’s fee
to another reasonable percentage.
      (4)   After the expiration of the ADU thirty-year control period or the
expiration of a Renewable thirty-year control period, but prior to the
expiration of twenty years after the expiration of the ADU thirty-year control
period or the expiration of the Renewable thirty-year control period, as
applicable (“ADU Extended Control Period”), such ADU may be offered for resale
to members of the general public, at fair market value, provided that the
difference between the actual resale price and the adjusted ADU sale control
price shall be divided equally between the seller and the County Housing Trust.
      (5)   At least forty-five days prior to an ADU being offered to resale
after the expiration of the ADU thirty-year control period or the expiration of
a Renewable thirty-year control period, but prior to the expiration of the ADU
extended control period, such ADU shall first be offered at fair market value
exclusively to the Board or its designee. The forty-five-day resale period
shall begin upon the Board’s receipt of written notice, sent by registered or
certified mail, that an ADU is available for resale. The written notice shall
include the address of the ADU as well as its parcel identification number. An
additional thirty-days shall be allowed for settlement.
      (6)   Any amount owed to the County Housing Trust pursuant to sub-
sections (a)(1), (a)(2)B. or (a)(4) hereof that remains unpaid after the resale
of an ADU shall automatically become a lien on such ADU with priority over any
lien recorded after the declaration of ADU covenants on such ADU as provided in
sub-section (a)(1)D. hereof, with the exception of the deed(s) of trust that
financed the certified owner who is reselling the ADU, up to the amount
permitted by sub-section (a)(1)F. hereof. Such lien shall also attach to any
proceeds from the resale of such ADU with the same priority as provided herein.
Should the proceeds from the resale of the ADU be insufficient to pay the
amount owed to the County Housing Trust, the lien for the unpaid balance shall
remain on the ADU.
      (7)   Non-judicial foreclosure sales of ADUs may be conducted at fair
market value.
         A.   Prior to the expiration of the ADU extended control period, the
lender, lien holders, or trustee, as applicable, shall provide to the Board or
its designee written notice of any delinquency or other event of default under
a lien or deed of trust secured by such ADU. For a forty-five day period after
receipt of such notice, the Board or its designee shall have the right to cure
such default, although the Board shall have no obligation to cure the default.
         B.   Prior to the expiration of the ADU extended control period, and
at least forty-five days prior to an ADU being sold at a non-judicial
foreclosure sale, the lender, lien holder, or trustee, as applicable, shall
provide to the Board or its designee written notice, including the address and
parcel identification number of the ADU, that such ADU will be subject to a
non-judicial foreclosure sale. For a forty-five day period after receipt of
such notice, such ADU may first be offered by the ADU owner at fair market
value exclusively to the Board or its designee, with additional thirty-days
allowed for settlement. The Board or its designee may bid on the ADU at any
non-judicial foreclosure sale.
         C.   The trustee foreclosing an ADU may use the proceeds from the non-
judicial foreclosure sale of such ADU to pay the costs/expenses of such
foreclosure and to satisfy those deed(s) of trust that encumber the ADU up to
the amount permitted by sub-section (a)(1)F. hereof, even if such deed(s) of
trust were recorded after the ADU covenants. Thereafter, out of the surplus
funds, an amount equal to half of the difference between the actual non-
judicial foreclosure sale price of the ADU and the ADU sale control price
adjusted as provided in sub-section (a)(3) hereof as of the date of the non-
judicial foreclosure sale shall be paid by the foreclosing trustee to the
County Hosing Trust. Any amount owed to the County Housing Trust that remains
unpaid shall automatically become a lien on the ADU, which shall attach to the
surplus funds from the non-judicial foreclosure sale of such ADU, with priority
over any lien recorded after the declaration of ADU covenants on such ADU as
provided in sub-section (a)(1)D. hereof. Should the surplus funds be
insufficient to pay to the County Housing Trust such amount, the trustee shall
pay the entirety of the surplus funds to the County Housing Trust, and no lien
shall remain on the ADU for the balance.
         D.   Upon the non-judicial foreclosure sale of an ADU, all
restrictions imposed by the ADU covenants and this chapter will automatically
and permanently terminate with respect to the foreclosed ADU.
      (8)   Any lender, lien holder, or trustee, as applicable, shall provide
to the Board or its designee, written notice of any delinquency or other event
of default under a mortgage, lien, deed or trust or any other financing
instrument secured by a project or development containing ADUs. For a forty-
five day period after receipt of such notice, the Board or its designee, shall
have the right to cure such a default, although the Board shall have no
obligation to cure the default.
   (b)   Subsequent rental of ADUs.
      (1)    The ADU rental control price for subsequent rentals shall be
controlled for a period of fifty years after execution of the initial lease
agreement for the respective rental ADU (“Fifty-Year Control Period”). Prior to
approval of a record plat for single family detached or single family attached
dwelling lots containing rental ADUs or site plans for single family attached,
multifamily attached or multifamily stacked buildings containing rental ADUs,
the owner shall record a declaration of ADU covenants (“Rental ADU Covenents”),
running with the land in favor of the County.
         A.   Within the fifty-year control period, no ADU shall be rented
except in compliance with all requirements of this chapter and the County
Zoning Ordinance, including that no ADU may be rented for an amount that
exceeds the limits set by the ADUAB pursuant to section 1450.07 (“ADU Rental
Control Price”).
         B.   Within the fifty-year control period, each time an ADU is offered
for rent, it must be offered exclusively through the County to certified
tenants.
         C.   The rental ADU covenants shall provide that within the fifty-year
control period, the rental ADU shall be subject to the provisions of this
chapter and the County Zoning Ordinance.
         D.   The rental ADU covenants shall be senior to all covenants, liens,
mortgages, deeds of trust or other financing instruments secured by such ADU
that may be recorded after the rental ADU covenants and shall be binding upon
all assignees, lien holders, trustees, mortgagees, purchasers and other
successors in interest.
         E.   Within the fifty-year control period, the substitution of ADUs
with comparable units within the same development may be permitted by written
agreement between the landlord and the Board or its designee, at the sole
discretion of the Board, provided that at all times the number of dwelling
units of each bedroom size and comparable square footage administered and
maintained as rental ADUs within the project or development is not less than
the number of rental ADUs of each bedroom size and comparable square footage
required by the County Zoning Ordinance or the proffers, as applicable, for
such project or development.
      (2)   Any rentals during the fifty-year control period shall not exceed
the ADU rental control price.
      (3)   Within the fifty-year control period, any lender, lien holder, or
trustee, as applicable, shall provide to the Board or its designee, written
notice of any delinquency or other event of default under a mortgage, lien,
deed of trust or any other financing instrument secured by a project or a
development containing rental ADUs. For a forty-five day period after receipt
of such notice, the Board or its designee, shall have the right to cure such a
default, although the Board shall have no obligation to cure the default.
      (4)    Within the fifty-year control period, and at least forty-five days
prior to a project or a development containing rental ADUs being offered for
sale at a judicial sale or a non-judicial foreclosure sale, such project or
development shall first be offered exclusively to the Board or its designee.
The forty-five-day period shall begin upon the Board’s receipt of written
notice sent by registered or certified mail that such project or development
will be sold or foreclosed. The written notice shall include the name and
address of the project and development and the parcel identification number(s).
      (5)   Within the fifty-year control period, the sale or judicial sale of
a project or development containing rental ADUs does not terminate the
restrictions on such project or development imposed by this chapter, the County
Zoning Ordinance or the respective rental ADU covenants, which shall apply to
such project or development for the fifty-year control period. Upon the non-
judicial foreclosure sale of a project or development containing rental ADUs,
all restrictions imposed by the ADU covenants and this chapter will
automatically and permanently terminate with respect to the foreclosed project
or development.

eligibility criteria.
      (1)   In the event a certified tenant of a rental ADU no longer meets the
income eligibility criteria established by Chapter 9 of the County Zoning
Ordinance as a result of increased income or any other factor, then such tenant
must vacate the ADU at the lease term, unless a substitute ADU has been
approved by the Department pursuant to section

someone who meets the eligibility requirements established pursuant to this
chapter or to occupy such ADU as his/her primary domicile.
      (1)   Notwithstanding criminal violations prescribed in Section 10.13,
Chapter 10, of the County Zoning Ordinance, it shall be a civil violation
subject to a civil penalty in the amount of $100 per day for an owner of a not-

continue to rent, permit others to rent or permit others to occupy such ADU
after such owner does not occupy the ADU as his/her primary domicile.

Land Development Applications or Development Permit Applications that only

Housing Development, are also excluded from the Program.
(Ord. 22-10. Passed 9-14-22.)
1480.04   ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Application. A party representing the Affordable Housing Development
is encouraged to request and attend the Department's optional Pre-Submission
Meeting (PSUB Meeting) referenced in Chapter 8 of the County Facilities
Standards Manual (FSM), when the Affordable Housing Development is proposed as
a component in part with a larger subdivision, or when the Affordable Housing
is proposed in whole as a standalone development.
   The applicant must complete the Affordable Housing Land Development
Application Fee Waiver Request and/or the Affordable Housing Development Permit
Fee Waiver Request in pre-approved forms provided by the Department. As part of
the Fee Waiver Request, the applicant must include a realistic and clearly
articulated summary of the proposed Affordable Housing Development and of the
budget for the Fee Waiver Request, which must not exceed the Delegated
Authority granted by the Board to the Director for the fiscal year when the Fee
Waiver Request is approved. For Affordable Units for rent, the Fee Waiver
Request must indicate that the monthly rent will be calculated in accordance
with HUD regulations for Low Income and Moderate Income. For Affordable Units
for sale, the Fee Waiver Request must include a rational explanation, including
quantification, of how the purchase price of the Affordable Unit(s) in the
Affordable Housing Development will be determined to attain the goal that the
Affordable Units will be affordable/attainable to Low Income and/or Moderate
Income households.
   In addition to the optional PSUB Meeting, the applicant must request an
introductory meeting between the applicant and an authorized representative of
the Department to review the Fee Waiver Request for completeness. The purpose
of this meeting is to answer questions regarding the Fee Waiver Request and
provide further guidance on the Affordable Housing Fee Waiver process.
   After the introductory meeting, the applicant may formally submit the
completed Fee Waiver Request to the Department for review, which must be
accompanied by an affidavit from the applicant in a form provided by the
Department attesting to the County that the Affordable Housing Development will
be completed and maintained as indicated in the Fee Waiver Request.
   (b)   Determination of Completeness and Eligibility. After receiving an
Affordable Housing Land Development Application Fee Waiver Request or an
Affordable Housing Development Permit Fee Waiver Request, Department staff will
determine whether the application is complete and eligible based on the
criteria above. If Department staff determines that the request is not
complete, verbal or written notice will be given to the applicant specifying
the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not remedied within 30 calendar days
of receipt of the notification, a determination will be rendered by the
Department staff based on the information provided. If an application is
determined to be ineligible, a written notice will be given notifying the
applicant of the ineligibility of the Fee Waiver Request under the Program.
   (c)   Approval or Rejection of the Fee Waiver Request. If the Fee Waiver
Request is approved, a copy of the approval will be provided to the applicant.
This approval must accompany any Affordable Housing Land Development
Application or Affordable Housing Development Permit Application at the time of
initial submission to the County. In case of disapproval, the applicant will be
notified and all applicable Land Development Application and/or Development
Permit Application Fees must be paid at the time of submission to the County.
   Approval of the Fee Waiver Request does not guarantee approval of the
proposed Affordable Housing Land Development Application or the Affordable
Housing Development Permit Application, which will be processed by the
Department as any other Land Development Application or Development Permit
Application, except for the process related to the Fee Waiver Request.
   (d)   Deed of Restrictive Covenants. Upon approval of the Fee Waiver
Request, the applicant, as the owner of the land where the Affordable Housing
Development will be located, must record a deed of restrictive covenants on
such land in a form approved by the County, which will ensure that the
Affordable Housing Development is completed and maintained as proposed in the
Fee Waiver Request approved by the Department. The Department will not perform
the review of the Affordable Housing Land Development Application or the
Affordable Housing Development Permit until the deed of restrictive covenants
on the land where the Affordable Housing Development is located is recorded. In
special circumstances, at the discretion of the Director with input from the
County Attorney's Office, when the applicant of the Fee Waiver Request has not
acquired ownership over the land where the Affordable Housing Development will
be located by the time of submission of the Affordable Housing Land Development
Application or the Affordable Housing Development Permit, the applicant must
pay the applicable Fees, subject to reimbursement by the County at the time of
recordation of the Deed of Restrictive Covenants.
   (e)   Delegated Authority. Starting in fiscal year 2024 and for every fiscal
year thereafter, the Board may determine the amount of the Delegated Authority,
as part of the County's budget process. If the Board decides to make no
changes, then the previous fiscal year's Delegated Authority will remain in
place.
   Fee Waiver Requests will be received by the Department on a rolling basis
throughout the year on a first-come, first-served basis, and processed by the
Department up to the amount of the Delegated Authority per Affordable Housing
Development for the fiscal year when the Fee Waiver Request is approved. The
maximum dollar amount of Fee Waiver Requests that could be approved by the
Department on any given fiscal year cannot exceed the Delegated Authority
approved by the Board for that given fiscal year.
   The Board, in special circumstances at its own discretion, may approve by
resolution an increment of the Delegated Authority previously approved for that
fiscal year.
   (f)   Completion of the Affordable Housing Development Breach. The applicant
must complete the Affordable Housing Development within three (3) years of the
approval of the Affordable Housing Land Development Application Fee Waiver
Request and/or the Affordable Housing Development Permit Fee Waiver Request.
The Director, at his/her discretion, may extend the period for another year, if
the applicant demonstrates that the delay is not attributable to fault of the
applicant. Should the applicant be unable to complete the Affordable Housing
Development for which the Fee Waiver Request was approved within such three (3)
years, the applicant must pay to the County, within thirty (30) business days
after the third anniversary of the approval of such Fee Waiver Request, the
amount of the Fees previously waived.
