   The county finds that the preservation of real estate devoted to
agricultural, horticultural, forest, and open space uses within its boundaries
is in the public interest and, having heretofore adopted a land use plan,
hereby ordains that such real estate shall be taxed in accordance with the
provision of VA Code Title 58.1, Chapter 32, § 58.1-3230 and this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 5-10-1990; Ord. passed 4-14-2011; Ord. passed 4-13-2017)

§§ 58.1-3230 and 58.1-3233 may, at least 60 days preceding the tax year for
which such taxation is sought, apply to the Commissioner of the Revenue for the
classification, assessment, and taxation of its use, under the procedures set
forth in VA Code § 58.1-3236. (In any year in which a general reassessment is
being made such application may be submitted until 30 days have elapsed after
the notice of increase in assessment is mailed.) Such application shall be on
forms provided by the State Department of Taxation and supplied by the
Commissioner of the Revenue and shall include such additional schedules,
photographs, and drawings as may be required by the Commissioner of the
Revenue. An individual who is the owner of an undivided interest in a parcel
may apply on behalf of himself or herself and the other owners of such parcel
upon submitting an affidavit that such other owners are minors or cannot be
located. An application shall be submitted whenever the use or acreage of such
land previously approved changes, except when a change in acreage occurs solely
as a result of a conveyance necessitated by governmental action or condemnation
of a portion of any land previously approved for taxation on the basis of use
assessment. An application fee of $25 shall accompany each application. In
cases where an applicant is requesting special assessment for four or more
parcels, the application fee shall be $25 per parcel for the first four parcels
and $15 per parcel for any additional parcels over four.
   (B)   A separate application shall be filed for each parcel on the land
book; however, separately recorded parcels which are contiguous are allowed to
file one application for the contiguous parcels, provided they are under the
same deeded ownership. The Commissioner of the Revenue shall allow a qualifying
parcel (both acreage and use) to also enroll other qualifying use(s) even if
the acreage requirement is not met for the other use(s).
   (C)   Applications may be filed within no more than 60 days after the filing
deadline specified in division (A) above, upon the payment of a late filing
fee, which shall be double the normal application fee.
   (D)   No application for assessment based on use shall be accepted or
approved if at the time the application is filed the tax on the land affected
is delinquent; provided, however, upon payment of all delinquent taxes,
interest, and penalties relating to such parcel, the application shall be
treated in accordance with the provisions of this section.
   (E)   (1)   Such property owner must revalidate annually with the
Commissioner of the Revenue any application previously approved, a revalidation
fee of $10 shall accompany each application for revalidation every sixth year.
      (2)   Late filing of a revalidation form must be made on or before the
effective date of the assessment and accompanied with a late filing fee of $20.
      (3)   Failure to revalidate annually, prior to the effective date of the
assessment, will result in lands being removed from the program for that year.
New application will be required for re-enrollment.

hereunder;
      (2)   The real estate devoted to agricultural or horticultural use
consists of a minimum of five acres, forest use consists of a minimum of 20
acres and open space use consists of minimum of 20 acres; and
      (3)   The real estate devoted to open-space use is:
         (a)   Within an agricultural, forestal, or agricultural and forestal
district entered into pursuant to VA Code Title 15.2, Chapter 43, §§ 15.2-4300
et seq.;
         (b)   Subject to a recorded perpetual easement that is held by a
public body, and promotes the open-space use classification, as defined in VA
Code § 58.1-3230; or
         (c)   Subject to a recorded commitment entered into by the landowners
with the local governing body not to change the use to a non-qualifying use for
a time period stated in the commitment of ten years. Such commitment shall be
subject to uniform standards prescribed by the Director of the Department of
Conservation and Recreation. Such commitment shall run with the land for the
applicable period, and may be terminated in the manner provided in VA Code §
15.2-4314 for withdrawal of land from an agricultural, a forestal, or an
agricultural and forestal district.
   (B)   If the Commissioner of the Revenue determines that the subject
property does meet such criteria, he or she shall determine the value of such
property for its qualifying use, as well as its fair market value.
   (C)   In determining whether the subject property meets the criteria for
agricultural use or horticultural use, the Commissioner of the Revenue may
request an opinion from the Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services;
in determining whether the subject property meets the criteria for forest use
he or she may request an opinion from the State Forester; and, in determining
whether the subject property meets the criteria for open space use, he or she
may request an opinion from the Director of Conservation and Historic
Resources. Upon the refusal of the Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer
Services, State Forester, or the Director of the Department of Conservation and
Historic Resources or the Director of the Commission of Outdoor Recreation to
issue an opinion, or in the event of an unfavorable opinion which does not
comport with standards set forth by the respective director, the party
aggrieved may seek relief from any court of record wherein the real estate in
question is located. If the court finds in his or her favor it may issue an
order, which shall serve in lieu of an opinion for the purposes of this
subchapter.

valuation, assessment, and taxation based upon land use shall depend on
continuance of the real estate in a qualifying use, continued payment of taxes
as required in VA Code § 58.1-3235 and compliance with the other requirements
of VA Code Title 58.1, Chapter 15, Article 1.1 and this subchapter, and not
upon continuance in the same owner of title to the land.

property that has a special assessment as provided for in this subchapter are
delinquent, the County Treasurer shall send notice of that fact and the general
provisions of VA Code § 58.1-3235 to the property owner by first-class mail.
If, after sending such notice, such delinquent taxes remain unpaid on June 1,
the Treasurer shall notify the appropriate Commissioner of the Revenue who
shall remove such parcel from the land use program. Such removal shall become

   (A)   When real estate that has been taxed according to special assessment
changes to a non-qualifying use there is hereby imposed a rollback tax, and
interest thereon, in such amounts as may be determined under VA Code § 58.1-
3237.
   (B)   The owner of any real estate liable for rollback taxes shall, within
60 days following a change in use of such property to a non-qualifying use,
report such change to the Commissioner of the Revenue or other assessing
officer on such forms as may be prescribed. The Commissioner shall determine
and assess the rollback tax, which shall be assessed against and paid by the
owner of the property at the time the change in use which no longer qualifies
occurs and shall be paid to the Treasurer within 30 days of the assessment. Any
person failing to report properly any change in use of property for which an
application for use value taxation had been filed within 60 days following such
change shall be liable for all such taxes, in such amounts and at such times as
if he or she had complied herewith and assessments had been properly made.
Further, upon failure to report within 60 days following such change in use
and/or failure to pay within 30 days of assessment, such owner shall be liable
for an additional penalty equal to 10% of the amount of the rollback tax and
interest, which penalty shall be collected as a part of the tax. In addition to
such penalty for failure to make the required report, there is hereby imposed
interest of 0.5% of the amount of the rollback tax, interest, and penalty, for
each month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues.
   (C)   Any person making material misstatement of fact in any application
filed pursuant hereto shall be liable for all taxes, in such amounts and at
such times as if such property had been assessed on the basis of fair market
value as applied to other real estate in the taxing jurisdiction, together with
interest and penalties thereon. If such material misstatement was made with the
intent to defraud the county, he or she shall be further assessed with an
additional penalty on 100% of such unpaid taxes.

perennial Sorghum spp. on his or her property. Provided, however, a landowner

   (G)   The Board may accept, use, or expend such aid, gift, grant, or loan as
may from time to time be made available from any source, public or private, for
the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section.
   (H)   Services rendered for actual control practices may be billed to the
landowner or lessee and collected. All reimbursements shall be promptly
deposited in a special Johnsongrass Control Fund and shall not revert to the
General Fund of the county regardless of date accrued or collected. Collected
or renewed funds for county expenditures shall be considered unexpended for
cost-share purposes.
   (I)   A sum of $5,000 is hereby appropriated as a matching fund or better to
implement and continue the Johnsongrass control program.

GENERAL PROVISIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
§ 151.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of life and property,
the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and
governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public
funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by:
   (A)   Regulating uses, activities, and development which alone or in
combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development,
will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities, and
frequencies.
   (B)   Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development
from locating within areas subject to flooding.
   (C)   Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur
in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding and
flood damage.
   (D)   Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.

§ 151.02  DESIGNATION OF FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Director of Planning and Zoning is hereby appointed to administer and
implement these regulations and is referred to herein as the Floodplain
Administrator.  The Floodplain Administrator may:
   (A)   Do the work themselves.  In the absence of a designated Floodplain
Administrator, the duties are conducted by the Richmond County chief executive
officer.
   (B)   Delegate duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations to
qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors and other employees.
   (C)   Enter into a written agreement or written contract with another
community or private sector entity to administer specific provisions of these
regulations.  Administration of any part of these regulations by another entity
shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant to the
participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth
at 44 C.F.R. § 59.22.
(Ord. passed - -20 )
§ 151.03  DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include but are not limited to:
   (A)   Review applications for permits to determine whether proposed
activities will be located in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
   (B)   Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide available base flood
elevation and flood hazard information.
   (C)   Review applications to determine whether proposed activities will be
reasonably safe from flooding and require new construction and substantial
improvements to meet the requirements of these regulations.
   (D)   Review applications to determine whether all necessary permits have
been obtained from the federal, state, and local agencies from which prior or
concurrent approval is required; in particular, permits from state agencies for
any construction, reconstruction, repair, or alteration of a dam, reservoir, or
waterway obstruction (including bridges, culverts, structures), any alterations
of a watercourse, or any change of the course, current, or cross section of a
stream or body of water, including any change to the 100-year frequency
floodplain of free-flowing non-tidal water of the state.
   (E)   Verify that applicants proposing an alteration of a watercourse have
notified adjacent communities, the Department of Conservation and Recreation
(Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management), and other appropriate
agencies (VADEQ, USACE) and have submitted copies of such notifications to
FEMA.
   (F)   Advise applicants for new construction or substantial improvements of
structures that are located within an area of the Coastal Barrier Resources
System established by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act that federal flood
insurance is not available on such structures; areas subject to these
limitations are shown on flood insurance rate maps as coastal barrier resource
system areas (CBRS) or otherwise protected areas (OPA).
   (G)   Approve applications and issue permits to develop in flood hazard
areas if the provisions of these regulations have been met, or disapprove
applications if the provisions of these regulations have not been met.
   (H)   Inspect or cause to be inspected, buildings, structures, and other
development for which permits have been issued to determine compliance with
these regulations or to determine if non-compliance has occurred or violations
have been committed.
   (I)   Review evaluation certificated and require incomplete or deficient
certificates to be corrected.
   (J)   Submit to FEMA, or require applicants to submit to FEMA, data and
information necessary to maintain FIRMs, including hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analyses prepared by or for the (community), within six months
after such data and information becomes available if the analysis indicates
changes in base flood elevations.
   (K)   Maintain and permanently keep records that are necessary for the
administration of these regulations, including:
      (1)   Flood insurance studies, flood insurance rate maps (including
historic studies and maps and current effective studies and maps) and letters
of map change; and
      (2)   Documentation supporting issuance and denial of permits, Elevation
certificates, documentation of the elevation (in relation to the datum on the
FIRM) to which structures have been floodproofed, other required design
certifications, variances, and records of enforcement actions taken to correct
violations of these regulations.
   (L)   Enforce the provisions of these regulations, investigate violations,
issue notices of violations or stop work orders, and require permit holders to
take corrective actions.
   (M)   Advise the Board of Zoning Appeals regarding the intent of these
regulations and, for each application for a variance, prepare a staff report
and recommendation.
   (N)   Administer the requirements related to proposed work on existing
buildings:
      (1)   Make determinations as to whether buildings and structures that are
located in flood hazard areas and that are damaged by any cause have been
substantially damaged.
      (2)   Make reasonable efforts to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a permit to repair, rehabilitate, or
reconstruct, and prohibit the non-compliant repair of substantially damaged
buildings except for temporary emergency protective measures necessary to
secure a property or stabilize a building or structure to prevent additional
damage.
   (O)   Undertake, as determined appropriate by the Floodplain Administrator
due to the circumstances, other actions which may include but are not limited
to: issuing press releases, public service announcements, and other public
information materials related to permit requests and repair of damaged
structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local agencies to
assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged
structures information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in
special flood hazard area; and assisting property owners with documentation
necessary to file claims to increased cost of compliance coverage under NFIP
flood insurance policies.
   (P)   Notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency when the corporate
boundaries of the (community) have been modified and:
      (1)   Provide a map that clearly delineates the new corporate boundaries
or the new area for which the authority to regulate pursuant to these
regulations has either been assumed or relinquished through annexation; and
      (2)   If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard
areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set
forth in these regulations, prepare amendments to these regulations to adopt
the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the
governing body for adoption; such adoption shall take    place at the same time
as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended regulations
shall be provided to the Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of
Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA.
   (Q)   Upon the request of FEMA, complete and submit a report concerning
participation in the NFIP which may request information regarding the number of
buildings in the SFHA, number of permits issued for development in the SFHA, a
number of variances issued for development in the SFHA.
   (R)   It is the duty of the Community Floodplain Administrator to take into
account flood, mudslide and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that
they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use
throughout the entire jurisdiction are of the Community, whether or not those
hazards have been specifically delineated geographically (e.g. via mapping or
surveying).
(Ord. passed - -20 )
§ 151.04  APPLICABILITY.
   These provisions shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the
county, and identified as being in the special flood hazard area according to
the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) that is provided to the county by FEMA.
(Ord. passed - -20 )
§ 151.05  COMPLIANCE AND LIABILITY.
   (A)   No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be
located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally
altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter
and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within
the jurisdiction of this chapter.
   (B)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study.  Larger floods may occur on rare
occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such
as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris.  This chapter does not
imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or that land uses permitted
within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   (C)   This subchapter shall not create liability on the part of the county,
or any officer of employee thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (D)   Records of actions associated with administering this chapter shall be
kept on file and maintained by the Zoning Administrator.

carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a body of
water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of
water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually
high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe story, or
by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as
defined in division (1)(a) of this definition.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).  An official map of a community, on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special hazard
areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.  A FIRM that has
been made available digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map
(DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS).  A report by FEMA that examine evaluates and

prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined
by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual

rate map or flood insurance study.  LETTERS OF MAP CHANGE include:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).  An amendment based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area.  A  LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate
map and establishes that a LAND as defined by meets and bounds or structure is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway
delineations, and planimetric features.  A letter of map revision based on fill
(LOMR-F), is a determinations that a structure or parcel of land has been
elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer
exposed to flooding associated with the base flood. In order to qualify for
this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance
with the community's floodplain management regulations.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE.  The lowest natural elevation of the ground surface
next to the walls of a structure.
   LOWEST FLOOR.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement).  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for

   NEW CONSTRUCTION.  For the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the
effective date of an initial Flood Insurance Rate Map of March 16, 1989, and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.  For floodplain
management purposes, new construction means structures for which start of
construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   POST-FIRM STRUCTURES.  A structure for which construction or substantial
improvement occurred on or after March 16, 1989, the effective date of the
community's initial Flood Insurance Rate Map.
   PRE-FIRM STRUCTURES.  A structure for which construction or substantial
improvement occurred on or before March 16, 1989, the effective date of the
community's initial Flood Insurance Rate Map.
   PRIMARY FRONTAL DUNE.  A continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of
sand with a relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward
and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high

temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE.  A building covered by a contract for flood
insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two occasions, in which
the cost of the repair, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market
value of the structure at the time of each such flood event; and at the time of
the second incidence of flood-related damage, the contract for flood insurance
contains increased cost of compliance coverage.
   SEVERE REPETITIVE LOSS STRUCTURE.  A structure that:
      (1)   Is covered under a contract for flood insurance made available
under the NFIP; and
      (2)   Has incurred flood related damage:
         (a)   For which four or more separate claims payments have been made
under flood insurance coverage with the amount of each such claims exceeding
$5,000, and with the cumulative amount of such claims payments exceeding
$20,000; or
         (b)   For which at least two separate claims payments have been made
under such coverage, with the cumulative amount of such claims exceeding the
market value of the insured structure. 
   SHALLOW FLOODING AREA.  A special flood hazard area with base flood depths

flow may be evident.  Such flooding is characterized by pending by ponding or
sheet flow.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.  The land in the floodplain subject to a 1%  or
greater chance of being flooded in any given year as determined in §
151.21, below.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  For other than new construction and substantial
improvement, under the Coastal Barriers Resource Act (P. L. - 97-348), means
the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement,
substantial improvement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date.  The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings,
the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. 
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of the construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE.  For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed
building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above
ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure hereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage regardless of the actual repair work performed. This term does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement officer and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.
   WATERCOURSE.  A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other
topographic feature on or over which water flows on or at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.

ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT
§ 151.20  DESCRIPTION OF DISTRICT.
   (A)   The Floodplain District shall include areas subject to inundation by
waters of the 1% annual chance flood. The basis for the delineation of the
district shall be by the special flood hazard area elevations or profiles
contained in the flood insurance study (FIS) and the flood insurance rate maps
(FIRM) for the county, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
Federal Insurance Administration dated April 16, 2015 as amended.
   (B)   The county may identify and regulate local flood hazard or ponding
areas that are not delineated on the FIRM. These areas may be delineated on a
“local flood hazard map” using best available topographic data and locally
derived information such as flood of record, historic high water marks or
approximate study methodologies.
   (C)   The boundaries of the Floodplain Districts are established as shown on
the FIRM which is declared to be a part of this chapter and which shall be kept
on file at the county offices.
      (1)   The approximated floodplain area shall be that floodplain area for
which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a 100-
year floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as Zone A
on the maps accompanying the flood insurance study. For these areas, the 100-
year flood elevations from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall
be used, when available. Where the specific 100-year flood elevation cannot be
determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey
Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use,
development, and/or activity shall determine this elevation in accordance with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  Studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
review by the county.
      (2)   (a)   The Special Floodplain District shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the maps accompanying the flood insurance study for
which 100-year flood elevations have been provided but for which no floodplain
has been delineated.
         (b)   Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction,
substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as Zones A1-30
and AE or AH on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect
on the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot at any point within the county. 
         (c)   Development activities in Zones A1-30 and AE or AH, on the
(community's) FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood
by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies
- with the county's endorsement - for a conditional letter of map revision, and
receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         (d)   The requirements in 44 C.F.R. 60.3(c)(10) only applies along
rivers, streams, and other watercourses where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations. The requirement does not apply along lakes, bays and estuaries, and
the ocean coast.
      (3)   (a)   The Coastal A Zone shall be those areas, as defined by the VA
USBC, that are subject to wave heights between one and one-half feet and three
feet, and identified on the FIRM by the limit of moderate wave action (LIMA)
line.
         (b)   For these areas, the following provisions shall apply: Buildings
and structures within this zone shall have the lowest floor elevated to or
above the base flood elevation plus 18 inches of freeboard, and must comply
with the provisions in §
151.20(C)(1) and §§
151.36 and
151.37.
      (4)   The VE or V Zones on FIRMS accompanying the FIS shall be those
areas that are known as coastal high hazard areas, extending from offshore to
inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast. For these areas,
the following provisions shall apply (44 C.F.R. § 60.3 (e)):
         (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements in Zones V and
VE (V if base flood elevation is available) shall be elevated on pilings or
columns so that:
            1.   The bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the
lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the
base flood level (recommended  18 inches) if the lowest horizontal structure
member is parallel to the direction of wave approach or elevated at least one
foot above the base flood level if the lowest horizontal structural member is
perpendicular to the direction of the wave approach: and
            2.   The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto
is anchored to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a 1% chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year (1% annual chance).
         (b)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or
review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction,
and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of
Article III, Section A 6 a.
         (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain the elevation (in
relation to the mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all
new and substantially improved structures in Zones V and VE. The Floodplain
Administrator shall maintain a record of all such information.
         (d)   All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of
mean high tide.
         (e)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with
non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood-lattice work, or insect screening
intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse,
displacement, or other structural damage to elevated portions of the building
or to the supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, the
breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10
pounds and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of  breakaway walls
which exceed a design safe loading limit of 20 pounds per square foot (either
by design or when so required by local codes) may be permitted only if a
registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs
proposed meet the following conditions:
            1.   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than
that which would occur during the base flood; and
            2.   The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and non-structural). Maximum wind and water
loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a 1% chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
         (f)   The enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be used solely
for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be
partitioned into multiple rooms, temperature controlled, or used for human
habitation.
         (g)   The use of fill for structural support of buildings is
prohibited. When non-structural fill is proposed in a coastal high hazard area,
appropriate engineering analyses shall be conducted to evaluate the impacts of
the fill prior to issuance of a development permit.
         (h)   The man-made alteration of sand dunes, which would increase
potential flood damage, is prohibited.
      (5)   The AO Zone on the FIRM accompanying the FIS shall be those areas
of shallow flooding identified as AO on the FIRM.  For these areas, the
following provisions shall apply (44 C.F.R. § 60.3(c)):
         (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated 18 inches
or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM, above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM.  If
no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall
be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
         (b)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
            1.   Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated 18 inches
or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM, above the highest adjacent
grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM.  If
no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall
be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade; or
            2.   Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be
completely flood-proofed to the specified flood level so that any space below
that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water and with structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
         (c)   Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be
provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

§ 151.36  ELEVATION AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In all identified flood hazard areas where base flood elevations have been
provided in the FIS or generated by a certified professional in accordance with
§
151.20(C)(4), the following provisions shall apply:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) in Zones A1-30, AE,
AH and A with detailed base flood elevations shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to or above two feet of the base flood level.
   (B)   Non-residential construction.  New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (or
manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including the basement,
elevated to or above the base flood level (recommend 18 inches or greater above
the BFE). Non-residential buildings located in all A1-30, AE, and AH zones may
be flood proofed in lieu of bring elevated provided that all areas of the
building components below the elevation corresponding to the BFE plus one foot
are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water,
and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are
satisfied. Such certification, including the specific elevation (in relation to
mean sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed, shall be maintained
by the Director of Planning and Zoning.
   (C)   Space below the lowest floor.  In zones A, AE, AH, AO and A1-A30,
fully enclosed areas, of new construction or substantially improved structures,
which are below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall:
      (1)   Not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall only be
used for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of
maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the
enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles
(garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior
door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
      (2)   Be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the

have openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit.
         (d)   The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one
foot above the adjacent grade.
         (e)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening
coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
         (f)   Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not
considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require
openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is
considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above.  Masonry or
wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure
and requires openings as outlined above.
   (D)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on
individual lots or parcels, must meet all the requirements for new
construction, including elevation and anchoring requirements.

VARIANCES
§ 151.60  FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED.
   (A)   Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the Designated
Enforcement Officer with respect to the provisions of this chapter, it is right
of that person to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance. Such
appeal must be filed, in writing, within 30 days after the determination by the
designated enforcement officer. Upon receipt of such an appeal, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall set a time and place for the purpose of hearing the
appeal, which shall not be less than two (10) nor more than 30 days from the
date of the receipt of a complete application for the appeal. Notice of the
time and place of the hearing of the appeal shall be given to all parties, at
which time they may appear and be heard. The determination by the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be final in all cases.
   (B)   In passing upon applications for variances, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other
sections of this chapter and consider the following factors:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or
velocities caused by encroachments. No variance shall be granted for any
proposed use, development, or activity within any Floodway District that will
cause any increase in the 1% chance flood elevation.
      (2)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others.
      (3)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of
these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
      (4)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage to the individual owners.
      (5)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (6)   The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
      (7)   The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use.
      (8)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development
anticipated in the foreseeable future.
      (9)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program.
      (10)   The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the
property in the time of a flood.
      (11)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
      (12)   The historic nature of a structure. Variances for repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon a determination that
the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      (13)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this
chapter.
         (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may refer any application and
accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any
engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in
evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities,
and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters.
         (b)   Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning appeals
has determined that the granting of such will not result in (1) unacceptable or
prohibited increases in flood heights, (2) additional threats to public safety,
(3) extraordinary public expense; and will not (4) create nuisances, (5) cause
fraud or victimization of the public, or (6) conflict with local laws or
ordinances.
         (c)   Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning Appeals
has determined that the variance will be the minimum required to provide
relief.
         (d)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the applicant for a
variance, in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the 1% chance flood elevation (1) increases the risks to life and
property and (2) will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance.
         (e)   A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well
as all variance actions, including justification for the issuance of the
variances. Any variances that are issued shall be noted in the annual or
biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration.
      (14)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site.
      (15)   Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of the
chapter.
   (C)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may refer any application and accompanying
documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other
qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed
project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and the adequacy of the
plans for flood protection and other related matters.
   (D)   Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning Appeals has
determined that the granting of such will not result in (1) unacceptable or
prohibited increase in flood heights, (2) additional threats to public safety,
(3) extraordinary public expense, and will not (4) create nuisances, (5) cause
fraud or victimization of the public, or (6) conflict with local laws or

determined that the variance will be the minimum required to provide relief
from hardship to the applicant.
   (F)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance,
in writing, that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
100-year flood elevation (1) increases the risks to life and property and (2)
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance.
   (G)   A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all
variance actions, including justification for the issuance of the variances. 
Any variances, which are issued, shall be noted in the annual or biennial
report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

   (A)   The current edition of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook, and the state erosion and sediment control regulations and all the
related erosion and sediment control provisions of the Chesapeake Bay
Preservation Area designation and management regulations as amended are hereby
adopted as an integral part of the county erosion and sediment control program
for the effective control of soil erosion and sediment deposition to prevent
the unreasonable degradation of properties, stream channels, waters, and other
natural resources.
   (B)   Persons submitting plans under this chapter shall be governed by the
criteria, standards, and specifications established in Chapter 6, Preparing an
Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook and all related erosion and sediment control provisions of the
Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area designation and management regulations.

§ 152.04  REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF PLAN.
   (A)   Except as provided for in division (B) below, no person shall engage
in any land-disturbing activity in the county until that person has submitted
to the Administrator an erosion and sedimentation control plan for such land-
disturbing activity and until that plan has been reviewed and approved by the
Administrator. Where land-disturbing activities involve lands under the
jurisdiction of more than one local control program, an erosion and sediment
control plan, at the option of the applicant, may be submitted to the Board for
review and approval rather than to each jurisdiction concerned.
   (B)   In the case of a land-disturbing activity for the construction of a
single-family dwelling, the Administrator may waive the requirement for a full
erosion and sediment control plan as set forth in this chapter. In the case of
granting of such a waiver by the Administrator, an agreement in lieu of an
erosion and sediment control plan, which is signed by the applicant and
approved by the Administrator, shall constitute authorization under this
chapter to conduct land-disturbing activity allowed by that agreement. Such
agreement shall set forth all conservation measures to be carried out and
maintained, shall grant right-of-entry to the Administrator and his or her
designees, and shall make the project subject to all review, inspection, and
enforcement provisions of this chapter which apply to approved erosion and
sedimentation control plans.
   (C)   The standards contained within the state erosion and sediment control
regulations and the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, as amended,
are to be used by the applicant when making a submittal under the provisions of
this chapter and in the preparation of an erosion and sediment control plan.
The plan-approving authority, in considering the adequacy of a submitted plan,
shall be guided by the same standards, regulations, and guidelines. When the
standards vary between the publications, the state regulations shall take
precedence.
(Ord. passed 6-12-2008)  Penalty, see §
152.99
§ 152.05  ACTION ON PLANS.
   (A)   The Administrator shall, within 45 days, approve in writing any
erosion and sediment control plan submitted to him or her if he or she
determines that the plan meets the conservation standards of the local control
program and if the person responsible for carrying out the plan certifies that
he or she will properly perform the erosion and sediment control measures
included in the plan and will comply with the provisions of this chapter. In
addition, as a prerequisite to engaging in the land-disturbing activities shown
on the approved plan, the person responsible for carrying out the plan shall
provide the name of an individual holding a certificate of competence, to the
program authority, as provided by VA Code § 10.1-561, of the state’s Erosion
and Sediment Control Law, who will be in charge of and responsible for carrying
out the land-disturbing activity. Failure to provide the name of an individual
holding a certificate of competence prior to engaging in land-disturbing
activities may result in revocation of the approval of the plan and the person
responsible for carrying out the plan shall be subject to the penalties
provided in this chapter.
   (B)   When a plan is determined to be inadequate, the Administrator, within
45 days from receipt, shall give written notice of disapproval stating the
specific reasons for his or her disapproval. The Administrator shall specify
such modifications, terms, and conditions as will permit approval of the plan
and shall communicate these requirements to the applicant. If no action is
taken by the Administrator within the time specified above, the plan shall be
deemed approved and the person shall be authorized to proceed with the proposed
activity.
   (C)   An approved plan may be changed by the Administrator in the following
cases:
      (1)   Where inspection has revealed the inadequacy of the plan to
accomplish the erosion and sediment control objectives of this chapter, plan
changes can be required without approval of the person responsible for carrying
out the plan; or
      (2)   Where the person responsible for carrying out the approved plan
finds that because of changed circumstances or for other reasons the approved
plan cannot be effectively carried out, and proposed amendments to the plan,
consistent with the requirements of this chapter, are agreed to by the
Administrator and the person responsible for carrying out the plan.
   (D)   The plan-approving authority may waive or modify any of the standards
that are deemed to be too restrictive for site conditions, by granting a
variance. A variance may be granted under these conditions.
      (1)   At the time of plan submission, an applicant may request a variance
to become part of the approved erosion and sediment control plan. The applicant
shall explain the reasons for requesting variances in writing. Specific
variances which are allowed by the plan-approving authority shall be documented
in the plan.
      (2)   During construction, the person responsible for implementing the
approved plan may request a variance in writing from the plan-approving
authority. The plan-approving authority shall respond in writing either
approving or disapproving such a request. If the plan-approving authority does
not approve a variance within ten days of receipt of the request, the request
shall be considered to be disapproved. Following disapproval, the applicant may
resubmit a variance request with additional documentation.
   (E)   When land-disturbing activity will be required of a contractor
performing construction work pursuant to a construction contract, the
preparation, submission, and approval of an erosion and sediment control plan
shall be the responsibility of the owner.
   (F)   In accordance with the procedure set forth by VA Code § 10.1-563(E),
any person engaging in the creation and operation of wetland mitigation or
stream restoration banks in multiple jurisdictions, which have been approved
and are operated in accordance with applicable federal and state guidance,
laws, or regulations for the establishment, use, and operation of wetlands
mitigation or stream restoration banks, pursuant to a mitigation banking
instrument signed by the Department of Environmental Quality, the Marine
Resources Commission, or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, may, at the option
of that person, file general erosion and sediment control specifications for
wetland mitigation or stream restoration banks annually with the Board for
review and approval consistent with guidelines established by the Board.
   (G)   State agency projects are exempt from the provisions of this chapter
except as provided for in the VA Code § 10.1-564.

§ 152.06  APPROVED PLAN REQUIRED; PERMITS; FEES; SECURITY FOR PERFORMANCE.
   (A)   The county may charge applicants a reasonable fee to defray the cost
of program administration, including costs associated with the issuance of
grading or land-disturbing permits, plan review, and periodic inspection for
compliance with erosion and sediment control plans if charges for such costs
are not made under any other law, ordinance, or program. The fee shall not
exceed any amount commensurate with the services rendered, taking into
consideration the time, skill, and Administrator’s expense involved.
   (B)   The Building Official, or any agent of the county, shall not issue any
building or other permits for activities which involve land-disturbing
activities unless the applicant submits with his or her application an approved
erosion and sediment control plan or certification of such approved plan from
the Administrator, certification that such plan will be followed, and written
permission for the Administrator (or his or her agent) to conduct on-site
inspections of the land-disturbing activity and of the conservation practices
set forth in the plan.
   (C)   (1)   The Administrator, prior to the approval of any erosion and
sediment control plan, may require of the applicant a reasonable performance
bond (except for single-family dwellings constructed with an approved plan),
with surety, cash escrow, letter of credit, or combination thereof, or such
other legal arrangement as is acceptable to the Administrator, to ensure that
measures could be taken by the county at the expense of the person conducting
the land-disturbing activity should he or she fail, after proper notice within
the time specified, to initiate or maintain appropriate conservation action
which may be required of him or her in order to be in compliance with this
chapter.
      (2)   The amount of the bond or other security for performance shall not
exceed the total of the estimated cost to initiate and maintain appropriate
conservation action based on unit price for new public or private sector
construction in the locality and a reasonable allowance for estimated
administrative costs and inflation which shall not exceed 25% of the cost of
the conservation action. Should it be necessary for the county to take such
conservation action, the county may collect from the applicant any costs in
excess of the amount of the surety held.
   (D)   If the Administrator or governing body takes such measures upon such
failure by the person conducting the land-disturbing activity, the
Administrator may collect from such person for the difference should the amount
of the cost of such action exceed the amount of the security held.
   (E)   Within 60 days of the adequate stabilization of the land-disturbing
activity, as determined by the Administrator, such bond, cash escrow, letter of
credit, or other legal arrangement, or the unexpended or unobligated portion
thereof, shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, as the case may be.
These requirements are in addition to all other provisions relating to the
issuance of permits and are not intended to otherwise affect the requirements
for such permits.

152.99
§ 152.07  MONITORING, REPORTS, AND INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   (1)   The Administrator shall inspect the land-disturbing activity to
ensure compliance with the approved plan and to determine whether the measures
required in that plan are effective in controlling erosion and sediment
resulting from the land-disturbing activity. The Administrator may require
monitoring and reports from the person responsible for carrying out the plan.
Furthermore, the District may inspect, monitor, and make reports for the
Administrator, upon request. The right-of-entry to conduct such inspections
shall be expressly reserved in the permit. The person responsible for carrying
out the plan, or his or her duly designated representative, shall be afforded
the opportunity to accompany the inspectors.
      (2)   At such time that the person responsible for carrying out the plan
feels that the land-disturbing activity is complete, a formal written request
shall be made to the Administrator for a final inspection.
      (3)   If, after completing the final inspection, the Administrator
determines that the person responsible for carrying out the plan has met all
requirements of this chapter, such bond, cash escrow, letter of credit, or
other legal arrangement, or the unexpended or unobligated portion thereof,
shall be refunded to the applicant or terminated, as stipulated within the
bonding arrangement.
   (B)   If the Administrator determines that the person responsible for
carrying out the plan has failed to do so, the Administrator shall immediately
serve such person a notice to comply by registered or certified mail to the
address specified in his or her permit application or by delivery at the site
of the land-disturbing activity to the agent or employee supervising such
activities. Such notice shall set forth specifically the measures needed to
come into compliance with such plan and shall specify the time within which
such measures shall be completed. If such person fails to comply within the
time specified, the permit may be revoked and the permittee or the person
responsible for carrying out the plan shall be deemed to be in violation of
this chapter and upon conviction shall be subject to the penalties provided by
§
152.10.
   (C)   If land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan,
the Administrator may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply
as specified in this chapter, issue an order requiring that all of the land-
disturbing activities be stopped until an approved plan or any required permits
are obtained.
   (D)   Upon receipt of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this
chapter from the Designated Enforcement Officer, the Administrator may, in
conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in division
(B) above, issue an order requiring that all or part of the land-disturbing
activities permitted on the site be stopped until the specified corrective
measures have been taken. Where the alleged noncompliance is causing or is in
imminent danger of causing harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition in
waters within the watersheds of the state, such an order may be issued whether
or not the alleged violator has been issued a notice to comply as specified in
division (B) above. Otherwise, such an order may be issued only after the
alleged violator has failed to comply with a notice to comply. The order shall
be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect
for seven days from the date of service pending application by the enforcement
authority or alleged violator for appropriate relief to the circuit court of
the jurisdiction wherein the violation was alleged to have occurred.
   (E)   The owner may appeal the issuance of an order to the Circuit Court of
the county.
   (F)   Upon completion of corrective action, the order shall immediately be
lifted. Nothing in this section shall prevent the chief administrative officer
from taking any other action specified in §
152.99.

same operative set of facts result in civil penalties which exceed a total of
$10,000, except that a series of violations arising from the commencement of
land-disturbing activities without an approved plan for any site shall not
result in civil penalties which exceed a total of $10,000.
      (2)   Note: the adoption of civil penalties according to this schedule
shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions and shall preclude the prosecution of
such violation as a misdemeanor under division (A) above. Refer to VA Code §
10.1-562J.
   (C)   The Administrator may apply to the Circuit Court of the county for
injunction relief to enjoin a violation or a threatened violation of this
chapter without the necessity of showing that there does not exist an adequate

shall not be considered SUBDIVISIONS within the meaning of this chapter and
therefore are exempted from application of the full design standards, fees, and
review procedures of this chapter:
         (a)   Sale or gift of a single division of a lot or parcel to a member
of the immediate family of the property owner. Only one such division shall be
allowed per family member, and shall not be for the purpose of circumventing
this chapter, and shall be subject to the minimum lot area, dimensional and
environmental requirements of this or other county ordinances, and shall be
subject to survey and recording in the land records of the county. A 20-foot

grandparent, or parent of the owner;
         (b)   The sale or exchange of parcels between adjoining property
owners where such sale or exchange does not create additional building sites or
create a lot or parcel which does not meet the minimum area and dimensional
requirements of this or other county ordinances;
         (c)   The combination or recombination of portions of previously

property, a lot may be created to include the dwelling unit. Such a lot must
meet the area and dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the
proposed lot is located and no nonconformities are created on the residual
property. An existing legal right-of-way will be sufficient to provide access
to the lot as long as the lot created is precluded from future SUBDIVISION by
deed restrictions; and
         (g)   Divisions of large tracts of property where the resultant
parcels shall be used for agricultural, forestal, or other undisturbed open
space provided such parcels are served by a right-of-way with a minimum width
of 25 feet. The plats and deeds for such parcels shall show the parcels are not

ADMINISTRATION
§ 154.025  PROCEDURE GENERALLY.
   (A)   Preliminary plat; generally. Whenever a subdivision is proposed to be
made, and before any sale or contract for sale or any construction work,
including clearing and grading, is started, the owner or proprietor of the
proposed subdivision or his or her duly authorized representative shall cause a
preliminary plat to be prepared together with improvement plans and other
supplementary materials as required herein. The preliminary plat shall comply
fully with the health, zoning, and other applicable ordinances in effect at the
time the plat is submitted for tentative approval.
   (B)   Sketch plan or concept plan. It is recommended, but not required, that
the subdivider submit to the agent a preliminary sketch plan of the proposed
subdivision, or general development plan for a condominium, apartment,
townhouse project, or water-dependent facility, prior to preparation of
engineered preliminary and final plats. The purpose of such preliminary sketch
plan is to permit the agent to advise the subdivider whether his or her plans
are in general accord with the requirements of this chapter. The agent, upon
submission of any preliminary sketch, shall study the same and advise the
subdivider wherein it appears that changes would be necessary. The agent may
mark the preliminary sketch plan indicating necessary changes and any such
marked sketch shall accompany the preliminary plat.
   (C)   Application for tentative approval. Five copies, or more if necessary,
of the preliminary plat together with improvement plans for roads, water,
sewer, and other utilities and other supplementary material shall be submitted
to the agent with written application for tentative approval. Such application
shall be submitted so as to permit the agent at least 30 days from date of
submission for review and investigation as set forth in the following sections.
For major subdivisions which require Planning Commission review, the
preliminary plat shall be submitted to the agent at least two weeks prior to a
regularly scheduled meeting of the Commission.
   (D)   Coordination with site plan review. Where a proposed subdivision
accompanies and is a part of a development for which site plan approval is
required under
Chapter 157 of this code of ordinances, the subdivision plat and the site plan
will be reviewed at the same time as nearly as possible under the requirements
of these regulations.
   (E)   Coordination with soils tests. Prior to approval of the final plat for
a subdivision planned for on-lot sanitary sewage disposal systems, a soils test
will be performed on each lot, either by the Health Officer or by a qualified
soils scientist employed by the subdivider, and the design of the subdivision
modified as may be required by the tests and as approved by the agent.
   (F)   Tentative approval or disapproval. When all submittal requirements
have been met, the preliminary plat shall be reviewed by the agent, the
Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors, and other agencies as may be
required. For a minor subdivision or where no state agencies are involved the
agent shall transmit his or her comments to the subdivider within 30 days and
shall complete action thereon as submitted or as modified within 60 days of
submittal. Where state agencies are involved or public hearing is required by
the Board of Supervisors, action on preliminary plats shall be completed within
a total of 90 days from submission to the agent. If approved, the agent shall
express approval as tentative approval, or if disapproved shall express such
disapproval and the reasons therefor and shall state what corrections or
modifications would permit approval of the preliminary plat.
   (G)   Notation of agent’s action. The action of the agent shall be noted on
two copies of the preliminary plat and referenced to any conditions determined,
which conditions shall be noted on or attached to the plat. One copy shall be
returned to the subdivider and the other retained by the agent.
   (H)   Meaning of “tentative approval”. Tentative approval of a preliminary
plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat or any guarantee of such
approval. It shall be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted
on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat. No
property shall be transferred or offered for sale, nor shall a building permit
be issued on the basis of an approved preliminary plat. The final plat will be
submitted for approval of the agent for recording when the requirements of
these regulations have been complied with. Approval of a preliminary plat shall
be valid for six months. The agent may grant one extension for an additional
period not to exceed one year upon written application therefor and good cause
shown.
   (I)   Final plat; generally.
      (1)   The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved.
The subdivider may record as a final plat only that portion of the approved
preliminary plat which he or she proposes to develop immediately, in all cases
subject to requirements of
Chapter 157 of this code of ordinances.
      (2)   If the subdivider records a final plat which is a section of a
subdivision as shown on an approved preliminary plat and furnishes to the
county a certified check, cash escrow, bond, or letter of credit in an amount
and form acceptable to the county for the estimated cost of construction of the
facilities to be dedicated within said section for public use and maintained by
the county, the state, or other public agency, the subdivider shall have the
right to record the remaining sections shown on the preliminary plat for a
period of five years from the recordation date of the first section, subject to
the terms and conditions of state law and subject to engineering and
construction standards and zoning requirements in effect at the time that each
remaining section is recorded.
   (J)   Final plat; application for, and approval or disapproval. Copies of
the final plat and other exhibits required for approval showing all or any part
of a subdivision planned for immediate development shall be prepared as
specified herein and shall be submitted to the agent within six months after
tentative approval of the preliminary plat, otherwise such tentative approval
shall become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and
granted by the agent. The agent shall act on the final plat within 60 days
after it has been officially submitted for approval by either approving or
disapproving such plat in writing, and giving with the latter specific reasons
therefor. Specific reasons for disapproval may be contained in a separate
document or may be written on the plat itself, and shall relate in general
terms such modifications or corrections as will permit approval of the plat. If
the agent fails to approve or disapprove the plat within said 60 days, the
subdivider, after ten days’ written notice to the agent, may petition the
Circuit Court of the county to decide whether the plat should or should not be
approved. The Court shall hear the matter and make and enter such order with
respect thereto as it deems proper, which may include directing approval of the
plat.
   (K)   Recording final plat. After the agent has approved the final plat, the
subdivider shall file such plat for recordation in the Clerk’s office of the
Circuit Court of the county within six months after approval thereof;
otherwise, such approval shall become null and void unless an extension of time
not to exceed 60 days, is applied for and granted by the agent in writing.
   (L)   Planned development.
      (1)   Preliminary and final plats and site plans for planned development
shall be subject to the same procedures and requirements as other plats and
plans and in addition the general development plan shall be subject to approval
by the Board of Supervisors after recommendation by the County Planning
Commission and after a public hearing held by the Board and advertised in
accordance with VA Code § 15.2-2225.
      (2)   In authorizing an approval, the Board of Supervisors may impose
such conditions regarding the location and character of features on the plan as
it may deem necessary in the public interest and may require a guarantee or
bond to ensure that conditions imposed are being and will continue to be
complied with.

improvements; or
      (3)   The furnishing by the subdivider to the agent of evidence of the
existence of agreements between the subdivider and qualified contractors for
the installation and completion of the improvements and the contractors’
performance bond with surety for the benefit of the county and the subdivider,
and satisfactory to the County Attorney, in an amount to cover the cost of all
the improvements required to be installed by the subdivider as estimated by the
Agent.
   (B)   In the event that the subdivider elects to proceed by methods in
divisions (A)(2) or (A)(3) above, the subdivider shall set a time, subject to
the approval of the agent, by which it is estimated the improvements be
installed and completed. Unless an extension of that time is approved by the
agent and a new estimated date of completion established, the agent shall take
necessary steps to proceed with the accomplishment and completion of the
improvements, making use of the certified check or calling on the security of
the bond.
(Ord. passed 8-10-1989)  Penalty, see §
154.999
§ 154.027  CERTIFICATION UPON COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Upon the completion of the installation of all improvements, the subdivider
shall furnish a statement, approved by the agent and prepared by a certified
surveyor or engineer, to the effect that all construction is in substantial
conformity to the regulations and requirements of this chapter, and the plans
as approved by the agent. The bond, escrow, or other guarantee of completion
shall be released within 30 days of written notice by the subdivider or
developer to the agent of satisfactory completion of construction, unless such
subdivider or developer is notified in writing of a delay in such release and
the reasons therefor; provided however that the agent may retain up to 25% of
the bond or other obligation for use in repair of improvements as may be
necessary within one year of completion. Any bond, escrow, or guarantee posted
in lieu of payment may be released partially as a portion or portions of such
construction progresses and is approved as completed by the agent. In the event
the subdivider has, in the opinion of the agent, just cause for not completing
the improvements in the entire subdivision where either a certified check or
surety bond or performance bond has been posted, the agent may release the
subdivider from his or her obligation to complete all of the improvements in
the subdivision provided the subdivider furnishes a statement by a certified
surveyor or engineer to the effect that all construction which has been
completed conforms to the regulations and requirements of this chapter and the
plans as approved by the agent; and provided further, that the subdivider has
furnished satisfactory evidence that the undeveloped portion of the subdivision
has been vacated by proper authority.

subdivider shall protect and preserve physical features such as large trees,
natural growth, watercourses, scenic points, historic places, topsoil, and
other similar community assets that will add attractiveness and value to the
property if preserved. Such features to be protected and preserved shall be
delineated on the preliminary plat and keyed to an appropriate brief statement
of intent to be set forth thereon.
      (4)   Where the subdivision design is such that certain open spaces or
other features are to be reserved for the common use of occupants or where
private streets are proposed, the agent shall require, subject to approval by
the County Attorney, that suitable measures be taken for permanent maintenance
of such spaces, features, or streets, in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter. Documentation of such measures shall be filed with the
preliminary plat.
      (5)   Where applicable, the agent may require that the preliminary plat
be accompanied by a letter from pertinent utility companies that the plat has

§ 154.051  SUITABILITY OF LAND GENERALLY.
   (A)   The agent shall not approve a subdivision of land if, from adequate
investigations conducted by all necessary public agencies concerned, it has
been determined by any such agency that the land is not suitable for
subdivision and development purposes of the kind proposed. Furthermore, a
subdivision for residential development purposes shall not be approved if it
contains lots which are not suitable for residential occupancy for one of the
following reasons or such other reasons that, in the opinion of the agent, may
endanger the health, safety, property, and welfare of persons building and
living on that lot or other properties:
      (1)   Land which is topographically unsuitable which by reason of steep
slopes will require extensive grading or unusual construction practices in
order for development to take place or which would provide less than 10,000
useable square feet of contiguous building area with slopes of less than 15%;
      (2)   Land with soils which by Health Department regulations or the
provisions of this chapter are unsuitable for septic system drainfields and
where no other means of sewage treatment is provided;
      (3)   Land with potentially injurious conditions resulting from special
soil and water conditions such as shrinking and swelling clays and/or marine
clays, unless such conditions can be rendered harmless by standard development
and construction practices. All such areas must be clearly indicated on the
plat; and
      (4)   Land with other adverse physical conditions identified by the
public agencies involved, such as habitat of rare and endangered species,
special and significant wildlife habitat, and identified sites of
archaeological importance.
   (B)   Where on-lot sewage disposal systems, such as septic tanks and
drainage fields, are proposed, a professional soils report stating the
suitability of the land for such systems shall accompany an application for
preliminary approval as set forth in §§
154.025 through
154.038. Subdivisions shall not be approved where lots are of insufficient size
or inappropriately shaped for construction of a residence and a suitable area,
as needed, for a well, septic tank, septic drainfield, and reserve drainfield.
The subdivider shall certify to the purchaser in writing, duly acknowledged as
may be required by law for recording a deed, that each lot offered for sale has
passed satisfactory percolation tests by the Department of Health and/or an
independent engineering analysis approved by the Department of Health, unless
public sewage has been provided. The subdivider shall also certify that
adequate drinking water is available for the lot as specified by this chapter.
   (C)   Land shall not be subdivided which does not have access provided to
each lot over suitable terrain as to provide reasonable means of ingress and
egress.
   (D)   Wetlands as defined in the State Wetlands Zoning Act, VA Code §§ 28.2-
1300 et seq., or any land subject to periodic flooding shall not be subdivided
in such a way as to provide sites for residential occupancy nor for any other
use which might involve danger to health, life, or property, or aggravate the
flood hazard, and any such land within the proposed subdivision whether it be
within a lot or reserved for common use of subdivision occupants shall be
restricted against buildings or otherwise reserved for uses which will not be
endangered by periodic or occasional inundation. To ensure sufficient buildable
land which is flood free, the agent may require the subdivider to provide
elevation and flood profiles sufficient to demonstrate the land to be free of
the danger of floodwaters.
   (E)   Any land herein described as unsuitable for building sites shall be
clearly indicated on the preliminary and final plats or site plan and, except
as may be permitted in an approved residential cluster development, shall not
be used to satisfy the minimum lot size requirements as prescribed by
Chapter 157 of this code of ordinances or by the County Health Official for
necessary septic and well installations, or the minimum lot area requirements
of this chapter.
   (F)   A plat for the subdivision of land with poor drainage, excessive
slope, or other adverse physical conditions will be considered for approval
only if the subdivider shall agree in writing to make whatever improvements are
necessary, and which, in the judgment of the agent, will comply with the
provisions of this chapter and render the land safe and otherwise acceptable
for development.

conceptual grading plan with notes on a topographic map as required to show
soil types and limits for clearing and grading and other disturbance, existing
and proposed grades, and location of natural watercourses, wetlands, and
floodplains.
   (C)   The preliminary plat for any subdivision shall show the location of
unusual soil conditions, hydric soils, shrink-swell clays, steep slopes
(generally those with a grade of 15% or more), and highly erodible areas as
delineated on the county’s soils and slopes maps and shall be accompanied by a
soils report which describes unusual conditions and measures proposed to
mitigate hazardous conditions.
   (D)   No grading shall commence without an approved erosion and sediment
control plan.

§ 154.053  TREE AND VEGETATION PROTECTION.
   (A)   To the extent that is economical and practical, natural vegetation,
particularly large trees, shall be protected and preserved within the
subdivision. Features and buffer areas to be protected and preserved shall be
delineated on the preliminary plat and keyed to an appropriate statement of
intent which is shown on the plat.
   (B)   Natural vegetation existing on slopes of 25% or greater, in wetlands,
within 100 feet of a perennial watercourse or wetland, and within 55 feet of an
intermittent stream shall be left undisturbed as a buffer area during
subdivision and development, provided:
      (1)   Access paths and view corridors or sight lines may be cleared along
waterways, lakes, or wetlands. In general, trees larger than ten inches d.b.h.
shall not be removed; and
      (2)   Where natural vegetation is removed, it shall be replaced with
other vegetation equally effective in retarding erosion and preserving natural
appearance.

   (A)   The preliminary plat for a major subdivision shall be accompanied by a
stormwater management plan showing information for determination of
improvements necessary for controlling stormwater runoff, including drainage
plans and flood control devices.
   (B)   The preliminary plat for any subdivision shall show natural drainage
patterns and a complete drainage layout, including pipe sizes and types,
stormwater detention and retention facilities, drainage easements, and means of
transporting drainage to a well-defined open stream.
   (C)   (1)   The stormwater management plan shall preserve natural
drainageways and wetlands, maximize infiltration of stormwater, and minimize
off-site discharge of stormwater.
      (2)   In general, impervious surfaces near waterfronts and wetlands shall
be avoided; grass swales shall be utilized and curb and gutter and paved
ditches shall be avoided except where necessary to prevent erosion in accord
with the standards of the State Department of Transportation.
   (D)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a natural drainageway through
which water flows continuously or intermittently, there shall be provided an
easement with a minimum width of 15 feet conforming substantially with the
boundaries of such drainageway and such additional width as may be necessary
for drainage and utilities at a particular location.
   (E)   (1)   A continuing maintenance plan, including an owners’ association
if necessary, shall be submitted for all elements of the drainage and flood
control system which will not be the responsibility of the county or the State
Department of Transportation.
      (2)   The subdivider shall provide assurance that all facilities are in
good repair and properly functioning when the last lot is sold.
   (F)   Areas subject to periodic flooding (100-year flood) shall be
delineated on preliminary and final plats.
   (G)   Residential building sites in areas subject to periodic flooding shall
be avoided. (Lot areas may include areas subject to flooding which are in
excess of minimum lot area requirements.)
   (H)   Construction in areas subject to flooding shall be in accord with
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

§ 154.055  SHORELINE PROTECTION AND WATERFRONT FACILITIES.
   (A)   For shoreline subdivisions which include docks, piers, marinas, boat
ramps, and other water-related development a joint Virginia Marine Resources
Commission (VMRC) permit application for filling, dredging, or construction in
wetlands or waterways shall be submitted by the subdivider with the preliminary
plat. The joint application will be forwarded to VMRC which will coordinate
permit review with the County Wetlands Board, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and other local, state, and federal agencies as required.
   (B)   The preliminary plat or site plan shall show the location of all
proposed docks, piers, marinas, boat ramps, community water access, and other
water-related structures and facilities, together with water depths by contours
or otherwise, current flow directions, tidal action, and the location and
extent of beaches, wetlands, swamps, subaquatic vegetation, and shellfish beds.
   (C)   Design of waterfront facilities or construction in wetlands and other
subaqueous areas shall comply with Subaqueous Guidelines and Criteria for
Siting of Marinas or Community Facilities for Boat Mooring of the State Marine
Resources Commission, State Institute of Marine Science wetlands guidelines,
and other applicable state and federal guidelines, criteria, and regulations.
   (D)   Designs shall encourage floating docks rather than fixed piers and
joint-use facilities rather than single-use facilities.
   (E)   Designs shall not include filling on subaqueous land or in wetlands
for the purpose of creating highland property.
   (F)   When shoreline stabilization is necessary, the design should rely on
nonstructural rather than structural methods in order to preserve natural
shoreline vegetation. Bulkheading, riprap, retaining walls, and similar
shoreline hardening methods should be avoided. Required shoreline stabilization
shall be placed behind vegetated wetlands.
   (G)   Where structural shoreline stabilization methods are used, the
preliminary plat shall be accompanied by a maintenance plan which describes
responsibility, procedures, and anticipated frequency of maintenance. In
general, structural stabilization methods should be designed and constructed to
be maintenance free for at least ten years with an expected life of 30 years.

§ 154.056  STREET LAYOUT STANDARDS.
   (A)   The location, alignment, grade, width, and drainage of all streets and
roads shall comply with the design standards and specifications for roads,
streets, drainage, water and sewer construction, and improvements on file in
the office of the agent and applicable specifications of the State Department
of Transportation, and shall substantially correspond to existing and planned
streets insofar as topographical conditions, public convenience, and safety,
and the proposed uses of land to be served will permit.
   (B)   The street layout shall be designed to create desirable building sites
while respecting existing topography and shorelines, avoiding impact on
wetlands, minimizing street grades, avoiding excessive cuts and fills, and
preserving trees, all to the maximum extent feasible for a reasonable economic
use of the land.
   (C)   Streets shall be spaced to allow for blocks meeting the dimensional
requirements contained herein and to minimize the number of intersections with
existing or proposed arterial thoroughfares.
   (D)   Where the subdivision adjoins or contains any part of a U.S. highway,
state primary highway, or state secondary highway designated as a collector
street on the Major Thoroughfare Plan of the county, the layout of such
subdivision shall provide for the platting and dedication of such part of the
major or collector thoroughfare in the location and at the width indicated on
such plan, except that the subdivider shall not be required to dedicate that
part of such thoroughfare which is in excess of 80 feet in width.
   (E)   Where deemed appropriate to the design of the subdivision and its
relation to adjoining areas, the agent may require the platting and dedication
of one or more collector streets, or parts thereof, to serve the subdivision.
   (F)   Minor residential streets, intended primarily for access to individual
properties, shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by through traffic.
   (G)   Streets shall be laid out to intersect one another at as near right
angles as topography and the limiting factors of design will permit, and no
street shall intersect another street at an angle of less than 70 degrees for a
minor street or 80 degrees for an arterial thoroughfare.
   (H)   Proposed streets in the subdivision shall provide for the continuation
of existing, planned, or platted streets on adjacent tracts, unless such
continuation shall be prevented by topography or other physical condition, or
unless the agent finds such extension to be unnecessary for the coordination of
development between the subdivision and such adjacent tract.
   (I)   Where the agent deems it appropriate or necessary to provide access to
adjacent tracts not presently subdivided, proposed streets in the subdivision
shall be extended to the boundary lines with such adjacent tracts and temporary
turnarounds shall be provided at the ends of such streets by means of temporary
easements or other appropriate means.
   (J)   Where the subdivision adjoins or contains a U.S. highway or state
primary highway as designated on the Major Thoroughfare Plan, the agent may
require that measures to be taken to reduce the impact of heavy traffic on the
residential lots abutting or fronting upon such thoroughfare and to afford
separation of through and local traffic, through one of the following means:
      (1)   By providing vehicular access to such lots by means of a marginal
access street or service drive separated from the highway by a planting strip
at least 30 feet in width and connecting therewith at infrequent intervals; or
      (2)   (a)   By designing reverse frontage lots having access only from a
parallel minor street or from a cul-de-sac or loop street, and with vehicular
access to such lots from the major thoroughfare prohibited by deed restrictions
or other means.
         (b)   The choice of the most appropriate method of accomplishing the
desired purpose in a specific instance shall be made by the agent giving
consideration to topography and other physical conditions, the character of
existing and contemplated development in the subdivision and its surroundings,
and other pertinent factors.
   (K)   Cul-de-sac streets, generally not exceeding 1,200 feet in length,
shall be permitted where they are necessitated by topographic conditions or
where in the judgment of the agent, such streets are appropriate to the type of
development proposed.
   (L)   Alleys shall be provided in business, commercial, and industrial
areas, unless adequate access to parking and loading area is provided by other
means. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas except to provide
rear access to attached dwellings or multiple dwellings or where required by
topographic or other unusual conditions. In the absence of alleys, easements
shall be provided for utility lines and/or drainage facilities.
   (M)   Except as listed below in this division (M), there shall be no private
streets platted in any subdivision and every subdivided property shall be
served from a publicly dedicated street constructed to standards of the State
Department of Transportation.
      (1)   In the case of a minor subdivision in which there are no more than
seven lots and in which no lot is less than one acre in area, private streets
may be permitted, provided:
         (a)   There is a direct connection to a state maintained public street
and no more than one such connection;
         (b)   1.   The right-of-way is not less than 50 feet in width or more
than 1,200 feet in length and is graded and constructed to State Department of
Transportation standards for an all weather road base. The subdivision plat and
all approved deeds of subdivision, or similar instruments, must contain the
following statement:
 
“THE PRIVATE ROADS IN THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL NOT BE PAVED OR MAINTAINED WITH FUNDS
FROM RICHMOND COUNTY OR FUNDS ADMINISTERED BY THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION. IN ADDITION, RICHMOND COUNTY SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION POLICIES WILL
NOT ALLOW SCHOOL BUSES TO TRAVEL AND PICK UP CHILDREN ON PRIVATE ROADS. IN THE
EVENT THAT OWNERS OF LOTS IN THIS DEVELOPMENT SUBSEQUENTLY DESIRE THE ADDITION OF
SUCH PRIVATE ROADS TO THE SECONDARY SYSTEM OF STATE HIGHWAYS FOR MAINTENANCE, THE
COST TO UPGRADE IT TO PRESCRIBED STANDARDS MUST BE PROVIDED FROM FUNDS OTHER THAN
THOSE ADMINISTERED BY THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OR RICHMOND COUNTY.
PRIVATE ROADS IN THIS DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT DEDICATED AND ARE OWNED BY (trust,
corporation, property owners’ association).”
 
            2.   Subsequent grantors of any subdivision lots to which such
statement applies must also include the statement on each deed of conveyance
thereof.
         (c)   The subdivision complies with the design and improvement
requirements of this chapter except for street paving;
         (d)   The subdivision plat is approved by the State Department of
Transportation and other state and federal agencies as may be required; and
         (e)   The subdivision and all lots are designed and appropriately
restricted so as to preclude any resubdivision or addition which would increase
the number of lots served by the street to more than seven or reduce lot area
to less than one acre.
      (2)   (a)   In the case of a cluster subdivision or planned development
as approved by the Board of Supervisors, private streets may be permitted
provided the minimum right-of-way is established at not less than 40 feet in
width and is graded and constructed to State Department of Transportation
standards for an all-weather road base and provided the design of streets and
lots is such as to inhibit future expansion of the subdivision beyond that area
which is approved. The subdivision plat or site plan and deeds shall be
restricted as in divisions (M)(1)(b)1. and (M)(1)(b)2. above and the plat shall
comply with division (M)(1)(c) above.
         (b)   Easements for ingress and egress for public emergency and
maintenance vehicles shall be granted to the county for all private streets.
Such easements shall be recorded with the instruments which create the private
streets. The provisions of this section shall not apply to private streets of
record prior to August 10, 1989.
      (3)   In the case of a minor two-lot subdivision, a private street may be
permitted, provided:
         (a)   There is a direct connection to a state-maintained public street
and no more than one such connection;
         (b)   The right-of-way is 20 feet in width and is for the exclusive
use of the lots created and shall therefore serve a maximum of two residential
building lots. The subdivision plat and all approved deeds of subdivision, or
similar instruments, must contain a statement advising that the street does not
meet state standards and will not be maintained by the Department of
Transportation or the county, that lot owners are responsible for an equal
share of maintenance and repair of the street, and that no public agency shall
be responsible for any costs involved in having the street brought up to state
standards for acceptance into the state secondary system of highways.
Subsequent grantors of any subdivision lot to which such statement applies must
also include the statement on each deed of conveyance thereof;
         (c)   The subdivision complies with the design and improvement
requirements of this chapter except for street construction;
         (d)   The subdivision lots are restricted so as to preclude any
resubdivision of the lots created; and
         (e)   Only one such two-lot minor subdivision shall be allowed per
parcel or contiguous parcels under the same ownership.
   (N)   No land shall be reserved, held, or controlled for the purpose of
prohibiting access to streets and roads unless owned, held, or controlled
exclusively by the county or an agency of the state or federal government.

§ 154.057  STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Right-of-way widths.
      (1)   Right-of-way widths for major thoroughfares, U.S. highways, state
primary highways, and state secondary highways shall be designed in accordance
with the current standards of the State Department of Transportation.
      (2)   Under special design conditions approved as a part of a cluster
subdivision, or in the case of a short street section with minimum traffic
service requirements, the right-of-way for minor residential streets may be
reduced, but in no case to less than 40 feet and provided that the agent may
require a minimum right-of-way of 50 feet to ensure continuity of the street
system and appropriate future subdivision of adjacent properties.
   (B)   Roadway widths. Roadway pavement widths for all public roads shall be
not less than the minimum specified by the State Department of Transportation.
      (1)   Where the design of the subdivision is approved as a minor
subdivision with private streets, the street shall be graded in accord with
standards of the State Department of Transportation to provide adequate
drainage for a compacted gravel or crushed stone roadway at least four inches
in depth and 16 feet in width. No surface treatment is required. A performance
bond will be required to ensure proper and complete construction.
      (2)   Where a cluster subdivision or planned development is approved with
a private street or common driveway by the Board of Supervisors, the street or
driveway shall be graded to provide adequate drainage for a compacted gravel or
crushed stone roadway at least four inches in depth and 14 feet in width. No
surface treatment is required. A performance bond will be required to ensure
proper and complete construction.
      (3)   All costs of inspection of drainage and pavement, including
employment of an engineer, shall be bourne by the subdivider.
   (C)   Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sac streets shall be terminated by a turnaround
having a minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet and a minimum pavement radius
of 35 feet, provided that the agent may approve a “T” or “Y” back-around or
other design to facilitate entrance and exit.
   (D)   Scenic roads. Where an existing or proposed street or roadway is
designated as a scenic road, scenic byway, or gateway corridor on the
Comprehensive Plan, the purpose and standards established for such roads to
maintain their scenic and historic qualities shall be observed in design and
development of an adjacent subdivision including, but not limited to, such
factors as maintenance of existing alignments and natural vegetation,
appropriate pavement design, replanting of vegetation or construction of berms
where necessary, and due care with respect to location and design of access
points.
   (E)   Street grades, curvature, and intersections. Street grades, curvature,
and intersections shall be designed in accordance with most current standards
of the State Department of Transportation.

154.999
§ 154.058  BLOCKS.
   (A)   Residential blocks shall normally not exceed 1,200 feet in length, or
be less than 400 feet in length, between street lines. In any residential block
more than 800 feet in length, a crosswalkway of not less than ten feet in width
may be required where necessary to provide convenient access to schools,
recreation areas, and other community facilities.
   (B)   Residential blocks shall normally be of sufficient width to provide
two tiers of lots of appropriate depth.
   (C)   Blocks for business or industrial use shall be of such length and
width as may be necessary to serve their prospective use, including adequate
provision for off-street parking and for the loading and unloading of delivery
vehicles.
   (D)   Irregularly-shaped blocks indented by cul-de-sacs or looped streets,
and containing interior parks or playgrounds, will be acceptable when properly
designed and where provision is made for adequate parking and for the
maintenance of the public or common-use recreation area.
(Ord. passed 8-10-1989)  Penalty, see §
154.999
§ 154.059  LOTS.
   (A)   The lot arrangement, design, and orientation shall be such that all
lots will provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography
and the character of surrounding development.
   (B)   (1)   The dimensions and areas of all lots shall comply with the
requirements of the zoning district in which they are located.
      (2)   In any case where public water supply and/or public sewerage are
not available or are not to be provided, all residential lots shall comply with
the minimum lot dimensions and areas established by the Health Officer after
appropriate water percolation tests have been performed, which dimensions may
be greater than required under the zoning regulations.
      (3)   At least one drain field replacement area shall be designated for
use in case of disposal field failure.
   (C)   Waterfront lots shall provide at least 150 feet of water frontage
measured in a straight line between the points where side lot lines intersect
the beach, wetland, or waterbody at mean low water unless otherwise approved as
a part of a planned residential subdivision.
   (D)   Where some lots in a subdivision have access to a waterbody or beach
and other lots in the same subdivision do not, provision shall be made for
community access to the waterbody or beach at one or more appropriate locations
to be maintained as common open space.
   (E)   Remnants or parcels of land below minimum area, including parcels
which fail percolation tests, which may be left over after subdivision of a
tract shall be added to adjacent lots, or otherwise disposed of rather than
allowed to remain as unusable parcels.
   (F)   Excessive lot depth in relation to lot width shall be avoided. Except
for unusual topographic conditions, a ratio of depth to width of two to one
shall be considered a desirable maximum.
   (G)   Every lot shall abut upon, and have access to, a street or road as
herein defined. Where so-called “flag lots” or “panhandle lots” are utilized to
provide common access points and minimize street construction, the number of
adjacent and parallel narrow lot sections or accessways shall be limited,
generally to no more than four, so as not to create an unreasonable potential
for confusion and dispute with respect to boundary locations. Provision of a
single common use driveway shall be encouraged, particularly at access points
to public or private streets or roads. The length of such accessways shall be
related to proposed lot size but generally shall be limited to no more than
1,200 feet. Width of accessways shall not at any point be less than required
minimum street frontage of 25 feet (20 feet for family divisions) and shall be
located and aligned for reasonable access by motor vehicles, including
emergency vehicles. Where the lot served is sufficiently large to permit
further subdivision, the minimum width of the accessway shall be 50 feet so
that a street may be constructed when further subdivision takes place.
   (H)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except
where their use is essential to overcoming special topographic problems or to
separating residential development from highway traffic.
   (I)   Corner lots shall provide sufficient width for minimum required
setbacks from both streets.
   (J)   Generally, side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or
radial to the street line, except where a variation to this requirement will
provide an improved street and lot layout.
   (K)   (1)   Where the land covered by a subdivision includes two or more
parcels in separate ownership, and where the lot arrangement is such that a
property ownership line divides one or more lots, the land in each lot so
divided shall be transferred by deed to single ownership simultaneously with
the recording of the final plat.
      (2)   Said deed shall be deposited with the Clerk of the Court and held
with the final plat until the subdivider is ready to record same, and both
shall then be recorded together.

154.999
§ 154.060  OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION AREA.
   (A)   The subdivision design shall reflect the community’s need for open
space sites for public facilities and recreation area as indicated in the
Comprehensive Plan and as may be anticipated in demand created by development
of the subdivision.
   (B)   (1)   Where a proposed park, public waterway and/or waterfront access
site, playground, school, refuse container site, public safety facility, or
other public facility or public use is shown on the County Comprehensive Plan
is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the agent shall require that
such areas within the subdivision be dedicated or reserved for purchase by the
county or other appropriate agency.
      (2)   Where large scale development occurs necessitating additional
community facilities not shown on the Comprehensive Plan, the agent may require
the dedication or reservation of new sites.
   (C)   All subdivisions containing more than 25 lots under five acres in area
shall provide common open space and recreation area equal to at least 5% of the
total area of all of the lots. This space is to be used by residents of the
subdivision and shall include such things as parks, playgrounds, and general
recreation areas. Land providing public or community waterfront access shall be
considered as contributing to this requirement. Such common or public open
space land shall be an amount not less than one acre in any single site and
shall be suitable for its designated use in location and topography and shall
be maintained by the subdivider until maintenance is assumed by a homeowners’
association or other approved agency.
   (D)   Land reserved for public purchase shall be shown for future sale as
lots by means of dashed lines and numbers on the preliminary and final plats
and may be sold as such without filing an amended plat if public action to
acquire the land has not been initiated within 18 months of recording the final
plat.
   (E)   Shoreline subdivisions or projects which include multifamily
development shall provide community access to and along the water’s edge for
all residents of the development. In addition, all new residential subdivisions
on shorelines and which include lots which do not have direct access to the
shoreline shall include community access to publicly owned waterbodies by means
of a pedestrian easement to the shoreline and a community recreation and open
space area along the shoreline. Pedestrian easements along the shoreline are
also encouraged. This requirement may be waived if the agent determines that
shoreline is unsuitable for such purposes and/or if the adequate public access
already exists in the area.
   (F)   Recreational areas and open space areas, whether publicly or privately
owned, which are provided in conformance with approval of any form of cluster,
multifamily, townhouse, or planned development provisions, and which equal or
exceed the requirements for dedication as set forth herein, may completely and
fully satisfy the above requirements provided the developer or subdivider shall
satisfy the Board of Supervisors that there are adequate provisions to assure
retention and future maintenance of said recreational areas.

154.999
§ 154.061  EASEMENTS.
   Easements shall be of sufficient width to permit the use for which provided
and shall include the right of ingress and egress over the easement area for
installation and maintenance. Specific easement requirements for water and
sewer, wired utilities, roads, and drainage are addressed in §§
157.090 through
157.110 of this code of ordinances.

chapter and subject to approval by the agent in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter and by the Board of Supervisors in accordance with the special
provisions of §§
154.025 through
154.038 and applicable zoning regulations. Projects may include single-family
dwellings, two-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings (apartments,
condominiums, townhouses, or other multifamily arrangements). Business and
industrial uses may also be located within planned community developments.
Design alternatives are intended to encourage permanent reservation of open
space and an efficient and improved use of the land to provide good building
sites by taking advantage of topography and minimizing grading or destruction
of natural vegetation. Plans shall not be approved where the clear purpose of
the design is to subvert the purposes of these regulations by inclusion of
excessively unbalanced distribution of land among lots or inclusion of open
spaces which are inappropriately located or which will not contribute to the
future amenity of the subdivision.
   (B)   No resubdivision or sale by any means shall be permitted in a
subdivision approved under this section, which resubdivision or sale would in
any way create a violation of this chapter or applicable zoning regulations.
   (C)   No more than 30% of the required minimum area of any lot shall be
located in a floodplain area or wetland and no part of the area of any lot
shall be covered by any body of water except that no more than 30% of the
required minimum area of any lot may be covered by the waters of a lake, pond,
or canal planned and approved as a part of and wholly within the subdivision or
development.
   (D)   An average lot area or residential cluster subdivision shall be
designed to promote harmonious relationships with surrounding adjacent and
nearby developed properties and to this end may employ such design techniques
as may be appropriate to a particular case, including coordination of yard
dimensions, location of lots of various sizes, location of buildings with
respect to project boundary lines, location of open spaces, and maintenance of
vegetation.
   (E)   (1)   The preservation of wetlands and natural vegetation, and
particularly mature trees on steep slopes, along watercourses and in stream
valleys, should be recognized as a primary design consideration in review and
approval of an application under this section.
      (2)   Failure to exercise due care in maintenance of landscape amenities
in accordance with approved plans shall be considered a violation of this
chapter.

§ 154.086  OFF-SITE SEWER, WATER, AND DRAINAGE COSTS.
   (A)   The subdivider shall be required to pay a pro rata share of the cost
of providing reasonable and necessary sewer, water, or drainage improvements
located outside of the property limits of the land owned or controlled by him
or her whenever the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The county determines that such off-site improvements to sewer,
water, or drainage are necessitated at least in part by the construction or
improvement of the subdivision;

assessment levied by the association may become a lien on the property if
allowed in the master deed establishing the homeowners’ association; and
      (6)   The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
   (E)   Maintenance of open space areas includes the following.
      (1)   In the event that a nonpublic organization with the responsibility
for the open space fails to maintain it in reasonable order and condition, the
Board of Supervisors may serve written notice upon such organization or upon
the owners of the development setting forth the manner in which the
organization has failed to maintain the open space in reasonable condition, and
said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be
remedied within 35 days thereof and shall state the date and place of a hearing
thereon which shall be held within 15 days of the notice.
      (2)   At such hearing, the Board of Supervisors may modify the terms of
the original notice as to deficiencies and may give a reasonable extension of
time not to exceed 65 days within which they shall be remedied. If the
deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof
shall not be remedied within said 35 days or any permitted extension thereof,
the county, in order to preserve the open space and maintain the same, may
enter and maintain such land for a period of one year. Said entry and
maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the open space
except when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the owners.
Before the expiration date of said year, the Board shall, upon its initiative
or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the open space, call a public hearing upon 15 days’ written
notice to such organization and to the owners of the development, to be held by
the Board, at which hearing such organization and the owners of the development
shall show cause why such maintenance by the county shall not, at the election
of the county, continue for a succeeding year. If the Board shall determine
that such organization is ready and able to maintain said open space in
reasonable condition, the county shall cease to maintain said open space at the
end of said year. If the Board shall determine such organization is not ready
and able to maintain said open space in a reasonable condition, the county may,
in its discretion, continue to maintain said open space during the next
succeeding year, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each year
thereafter. The decision of the Board of Supervisors or officer in any such
case shall constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial
review.
      (3)   The cost of such maintenance by the county shall be assessed pro
rata against the properties within the development that have a right of
enjoyment of the open space in accordance with the homeowners’ agreement, or if
maintenance is not assessed by the homeowners’ agreement then by the assessed
value at the time of imposition of the lien and shall become a lien and tax on
said properties and be added to and be a part of the taxes to be levied and
assessed thereon, and shall be enforced and collected with interest by the same
officers and in the same manner as other taxes.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Richmond County Zoning Ordinance” and
may be referred to herein as “this chapter” or “chapter”.
(Ord. passed 11-9-1995)
§ 157.002  AUTHORITY.
   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority granted by VA Code Title
15.2, Chapter 22.
(Ord. passed 11-9-1995)
§ 157.003  PURPOSE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted for the purpose of guiding development in
accordance with the existing and future needs of the county in order to improve
the public health, safety, convenience, and welfare of the citizens of the
county. This chapter is designed to plan for the future development of the
county to the end that significant environmental, historical, cultural, and
other features which contribute to the quality of life and character of the
county are identified and protected; transportation systems are carefully
planned; new community centers are developed with adequate highway, utility,
health, educational, and recreational facilities; the needs of agriculture,
industry, and business are recognized in future growth; residential areas are
provided with healthy surroundings for family life; significant agricultural
and forestry lands are preserved; and the growth of the community is consonant
with the efficient and economical use of public funds.
   (B)   It is also the purpose of this chapter to recognize and help sustain
traditional industries as follows: right of farming, fishing, and forestry.
      (1)   Farming, fishing, and forestry are the backbone of the county’s
traditional economy. The right to farm all land, to grow and harvest timber,
and to use the shores and waters of the county for traditional waterman’s
activities is hereby recognized to exist as a natural right. This chapter
protects that right as permitted uses everywhere in the county regardless of
specified uses and prohibited uses set forth elsewhere.
      (2)   This chapter protects the use of irrigation pumps and equipment,
aerial and ground seeding and spraying, tractor and other machinery, seasonal
farm laborers, and the application of fertilizers, insecticides, and
herbicides, the mooring, storage, and repair of workboats, nets, and equipment;
all for the purpose of producing from the land and waters such products as
vegetables, grains, hay, fruits, fibers, wood, trees, plants, shrubs, flowers,
seeds, fish, and shellfish. The right to farm includes the right to use land
for grazing by animals.
      (3)   The foregoing uses and activities, when reasonable and necessary
for the particular farming, fishing, or forestry activity, and when conducted
in accordance with generally accepted practices, may occur at any season, on
holidays, Sundays, and weekends, at night and in the day. The noise, odors,
dust, and fumes that are caused by them are also specifically permitted as part
of the exercise of this right.
      (4)   It is expressly found that reasonable nuisance caused to others by
such activities is more than offset by the benefits to the neighborhood,
community, and society in general. Among these benefits are the preservation of
open space, the beauty of the countryside, clean air, and by the preservation
and continuance of traditional livelihoods in the county.
      (5)   This right does not relieve the land owner from compliance with
pertinent local, state, and federal laws pertaining to these protected
activities.

157.999

§ 157.036  AGRICULTURE, GENERAL (A-1).
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this District is to encourage
continued agricultural and forest uses and preserve the rural areas of the
county where urban services, such as public water and sewer facilities, are not
available or planned for future installation. This District generally
corresponds to areas of the County Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map as
the Agricultural District. At the same time, the District is intended to
provide for limited residential development for those who choose to live in a
rural environment and to protect this development where it occurs. This
District recognizes the importance of agricultural and forest production as an
important component of the county’s past, present, and future well being. If
more intensive uses are desired for property located in the Agricultural,
General A-1 District, a change in zoning classification shall be considered.
   (B)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   The Agricultural, General A-1 District consists, for the most part,
of larger parcels of land in agricultural and forest uses. When the District
boundaries were established, some smaller parcels were included in the
Agricultural, General A-1 District. Where these parcels are two acres (87,120
square feet) or less in size, the regulations of the Residential, General R-
2 District shall govern with the exception of two-family dwellings as a
permitted use; unless such parcels receive an approved rezoning entitling them
to all uses of the district to which they are rezoned.
      (2)   For parcels greater than two acres in size in the Agricultural,
General A-1 District, structures to be erected or land to be used shall be for

      (23)   Solar power facility, large photovoltaic.
   (D)   Limitations on subdivisions.
      (1)   In order to maintain the viability of lands for agricultural and
forest production within this District, uses are somewhat restrictive. When
more intensive uses are desired, rezoning of the property shall be considered
where it can be demonstrated that the more intensive use is warranted and in
keeping with the County Comprehensive Plan. To protect against premature
subdivision of land and fragmentation of productive agricultural and
forestlands, subdivisions are controlled to maintain the uses mentioned in the
purpose and intent of this District. Within this District, the density of new
parcels shall not exceed one parcel per 20 acres, with the parent parcel being
allowed to be divided into a maximum of 15 lots. For parcels 20 acres or less
in size and for the first 20 acres of parcels greater than 20 acres in size, a
density of one parcel per two and one-half acres shall be permitted, up to a
maximum of four lots.
      (2)   For calculating the number of new lots allowed, the parcel of
record as of December 8, 2005, shall be considered to be the parent parcel. If
the parent parcel has been divided subsequent to December 8, 2005, the number
of additional lots allowed to be created from a child parcel shall be its
proportionate share of the remaining lots that could be created from the parent
parcel, unless rights to a different share of the remaining lots has been
transferred to the child parcel by deed from its parent. The number of new lots
allowed shall never exceed the parcel’s share of the remaining lots that could
have been created from its parent under density restrictions in existence on
November 10, 1995.
      (3)   Parcels recorded prior to November 10, 1995, which are less than
five acres in size may be subdivided into two lots without density restrictions
provided minimum lot sizes, dimensions, and setbacks can be met.
      (4)   Family subdivisions, on parcels recorded prior to November 10,
1995, shall not be subject to density restrictions and shall not count toward
the maximum number of new parcels allowed. However, any acreage encompassed by
family subdivisions shall be subtracted from the acreage used to calculate the
number of new lots allowed.
   (E)   Lot size standards.
      (1)   Table of lot size standards.

   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this District is to encourage
innovative and flexible development design that will create and promote a
sustainable and harmonious community. It is the intent of the District to
promote more economical and efficient use of the land while encouraging variety
in housing choices, neighborhood commercial uses, and accessory light
industrial areas, while at the same time, maintaining the greatest amount of
open area that results in the least disturbance to natural features. The
guidelines for this District shall be implemented by approval of an overall
Master Plan of development.
   (B)   Permitted uses. The Residential, Mixed Use District is devoted to
diverse uses that contribute to a coordinated balance of activities which
encourage and promote a suitable environment for family life and potentially
provides convenience shopping and job opportunities within a planned community.
The primary uses are residential in nature as follows:
      (1)   Single-family detached or attached dwellings;
      (2)   Two-family dwellings;
      (3)   Multifamily dwellings which may include apartments, townhouses,
condominiums, or similar development that provides more than two dwelling units
per building;
      (4)   Accessory structures as defined;
      (5)   Facilities necessary for rendering local public utility service.
Buildings, treatment plants, water storage tanks, pumping or regulating
stations, storage yards and substations, county sanctioned recycling centers
and refuse collection centers shall be considered as part of the Master Plan
for development. Underground utility service shall be required except where
shown to be not feasible;
      (6)   Community recreation uses, including clubhouses, golf courses,
pools, tennis courts, boating facilities, and similar recreational improvements
and facilities; and/or

amenities and community features. These uses are permitted to accompany the
residential uses and the provisions of this section are not intended for
creation of areas primarily devoted to these secondary uses:
      (1)   Churches;
      (2)   Schools;
      (3)   Childcare or day care center, including preschool classes;
      (4)   Business uses provided that such businesses are designed to serve
primarily the needs of the planned development in which they are located.

exceed 5% of the gross area of the planned development; and/or
      (5)   Industrial uses that are designed to provide jobs primarily for
residents within the planned development. These industrial areas shall be
allowed if shown to be compatible with the character and scope of the planned
development and shall not exceed 5% of the gross area of the planned
development.

property lines and required distances between structures within a Residential,
Mixed Use Development shall be determined as part of the Master Plan approval.
The preliminary site plan shall include an accurate accounting of the proposed
building locations, heights, setbacks, and separations.
      (3)   The maximum density of a Residential, Mixed Use Development shall
not exceed an average of one dwelling unit per gross acre. Land devoted to
business, industrial, and other nonresidential uses shall not be included to
determine the density ratio for the development as a whole. The Board of
Supervisors may permit an increase in the density of the development when it
can be demonstrated that such an increase is warranted by conditions
specifically applicable to the parcel or plan of development; provided, that
such increase will not have any adverse impact on the character of the
surrounding property, cause any potential health or safety hazards, or generate
traffic that will be excessive for adjoining streets.
      (4)   No minimum lot size restriction shall be placed on development with
the Residential, Mixed Use District. This flexibility is offered to encourage

designated scenic highways, byways, or waterways which contribute or will
contribute to the cultural, social, economic, political, or architectural
heritage of the county and the state.
   (B)   Application.
      (1)   The Historic Richmond Overlay District is created to be
superimposed on other districts contained in this subchapter. The uses, housing
types, minimum lot requirements, minimum yard requirements, maximum heights,
and accessory uses shall be those requirements applicable to the underlying
zoning district except as modified by application of the regulations in this
section.
      (2)   Historic Richmond districts shall be established by action of the
Board of Supervisors and designated on the Official Zoning Map.
   (C)   Permitted uses.
      (1)   A building or land shall be used for any use, or accessory use,
permitted in the underlying zoning district in which the premises are situated.
Any use is subject to review and action by the plan-approving authority in
accordance with the standards set forth in this section and the intent and
purpose of this chapter.
      (2)   The normal maintenance of a historic area or building or the
charging of admission fee for visitors, or the conduct of visitor centers or
services within a county, state, or national park, shall not be considered as
commercial uses.
   (D)   Use limitations. The following limitations shall apply within Historic
Richmond.
      (1)   No building or structure, except as provided to enhance the scenic
character of the area, shall be constructed within 100 feet of the right-of-way
of any designated scenic highway or byway. On-premises construction within the
view shed of a historic building should be avoided whenever possible, but when
unavoidable, should be sympathetic and compatible.
      (2)   Flexible development standards relating to drainage facilities,
pavement of driveways, and parking areas, and traffic control devices shall be
considered during the review of any proposed development along a scenic
highway, byway, or waterway so as to ensure that development is compatible with
the goals and objectives of the scenic designation.
      (3)   Development along scenic highways, byways, or waterways shall be
designed to minimize the number and size of curb cuts.
      (4)   Timber cutting activities within 100 feet of the right-of-way of a
designated highway or byway or adjacent to historic buildings or structures is
to be based upon considerations which emphasize selective timber harvest
practices, aesthetic values, or sanitation and salvage cuttings necessitated by
damage caused by fire, insect infestation, or other destructive forces, with
prior approval of the Land Use Administrator. The Land Use Administrator may
request advice and/or reports from the State Division of Forestry in this
regard. All flowering trees, shrubs, and wild flowers indigenous to the area
which occur within 100 feet of the right-of-way line of the scenic highway or
byway should be favored and protected where reasonable.
      (5)   Development permits issued in areas known or suspected to contain
archeological artifacts and data shall include a requirement that the developer
provide for a phase one survey and evaluation by an archaeologist. When the
county determines that a site has significant archaeological, natural,
scientific, or historical value, a development permit will not be issued which
would pose a threat to the site. The county may require that development be
postponed in such areas to allow investigation and/or retrieval and
preservation of significant artifacts.
   (E)   Standards. The following standards shall be considered by the plan-
approving authority in evaluating proposals within the Historic Richmond
Overlay Districts:
      (1)   The public necessity of the proposed construction or use;
      (2)   The public purpose or interest in land or buildings to be
protected;
      (3)   The historic, architectural, archaeological, and scenic value and
significance of the resource considered for protection and its relationship to
the surrounding area;
      (4)   The age and character of the historic structure, its condition, and
its probable life expectancy, and the appropriateness of the proposed changes
to the period or periods during which the structure was built and/or altered;
      (5)   The general compatibility of the plan of development and the
exterior design, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed to be used;
      (6)   The view of the structure or area from a public street, present or
future;
      (7)   The present character of the setting of the structure or area and
its surroundings;
      (8)   The probable effect of proposed construction on the natural
features in the vicinity of the resource/resource area including trees, wooded
areas, or terrain; and/or
      (9)   Any other factors, including aesthetics, which the plan-approving
authority deems to be pertinent in order to ensure compliance with the intent
and purpose of Historic Richmond.

§ 157.043  APPLICABILITY OF ZONING DISTRICTS; EFFECT OF OVERLAY ZONING
DISTRICTS.
   All lands existing within the county are situated within a base zoning
district and are shown on the Official Zoning Map and as listed above, and as
described within this subchapter, and shall be subject to applicable provisions
of that district. In addition, certain lands may be situated within the
Historic Overlay District listed above and as described within this subchapter,
and shall also be subject to applicable provisions of the Overlay District.
Where a certain property may be so situated that it lies within both a base
zoning district and the Overlay Zoning District, the regulations and standards
of both the base and Overlay Zoning District shall be applicable to the
development and use of such property. Where specific regulations or standards
regarding a property so situated may conflict, the more restrictive regulation
or standard shall be applicable.

§ 157.044  OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Official Zoning Map of the county.
      (1)   The unincorporated areas of the county are divided into districts
depicted on a set of maps entitled “Zoning Map of Richmond County, Virginia”
which, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
      (2)   The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature or the
attested signature of the Chairperson of the Board of Supervisors, together
with the date of adoption of this chapter. Regardless of the existence of
purported copies of the Official Zoning Map which may from time to time be made
or published, the Official Zoning Map, which shall be located in the office of
the Land Use Administrator, shall be the final authority as to the current
zoning status of land and water areas, buildings, and other structures in the
county.
   (B)   Amendments to the Official Zoning Map. Whenever any amendment is made
to the Zoning Map by action of the Board of Supervisors, such change shall be
incorporated onto the Zoning Map at a time and in the manner as the Board of
Supervisors may prescribe. Said changes shall be validated with reference to
correct notation by the Land Use Administrator, who shall affix his or her
signature thereto, thereby certifying that approved amendments to the Zoning
Map have been correctly incorporated. The date of official action and nature of
the change shall be entered on the Map. Any such change shall have the effect
of law 12:01 a.m., on the day following its legal adoption or on its effective
date, if officially established as other than on the day following its legal
adoption, whether or not it has been shown on the Zoning Map.
   (C)   Unauthorized changes. No changes of any nature shall be made to the
Zoning Map or any matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures
and requirements of this chapter. It shall be unlawful for any person to make
unauthorized changes on the Zoning Map.
(Ord. passed 11-9-1995)
§ 157.045  INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   In construing the Official Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply.
   (A)   Centerlines as boundaries. Where district boundaries appear to follow
mapped centerlines of streets, alleys, easements, waterways, and the like, they
shall be construed as following such centerlines as exist on the ground except
where the variation of actual location would change the zoning status of a lot
or parcel or portion thereof, in which case the boundary shall be interpreted
in such a manner as to avoid changing the zoning of any lot or parcel or
portion thereof. In case of closure of a street or alley, or vacation of an
easement, the boundary shall be construed as remaining at its location unless
ownership of the closure or vacation area is divided other than at the center,
in which case the boundary shall be construed as moving to correspond with the
ownership, but not beyond any previous right-of-way or easement line. In the
case of movement of any waterway, the boundary shall be construed as remaining
at its location.
   (B)   Property or other edge lines as boundaries. Where district boundaries
appear to follow street, lot, property, or other edge lines, they shall be
construed as following such lines.
   (C)   Boundaries other than as above. District boundaries which appear
parallel or perpendicular to, or as extensions of or connecting centerlines,
edge lines, or other features shown on the map shall be so construed.
   (D)   Boundaries extending into water. Where the full course of boundaries
extending into bodies of water is not shown, such boundaries shall be construed
as continuing in a straight line to intersect with other zoning boundaries or
to jurisdictional limits if no such intersection with a zoning boundary occurs
first.
   (E)   Dimensions. Where dimensions are not otherwise indicated on the Zoning
Map, the scale of the map shall govern.
   (F)   Unclassified areas. Where areas appear to be unclassified on the
Zoning Map, and classification cannot be established by rules set forth herein,
such areas shall be considered to be classified as within the Agriculture,
General A-1 District, until amending action is taken.
   (G)   Interpretation in cases of uncertainty. Where application of the rules
set forth above fails to establish the location of boundaries with sufficient
accuracy for the purposes of these regulations, the Land Use Administrator
shall determine the location, provided that no such interpretation shall be
such as to divide a lot which was previously and apparently undivided by a
district boundary.
   (H)   Jurisdictional boundary changes. Where territory is removed from the
jurisdictional area of the county, the outbound zoning boundaries of the county
shall be considered to have moved with jurisdictional area boundary.
(Ord. passed 11-9-1995)
§ 157.046  APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS.
   (A)   General. The regulations set by this subchapter within each district
shall be minimum or maximum limitations as appropriate to the case and shall
apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, except as
hereinafter provided.
   (B)   Use, occupancy, and construction. No building, structure, or land
shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part
thereof shall hereafter be constructed except in conformity with all of the
regulations herein as specified for the district in which it is located. No
variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals with regard to use and
density provisions. Any modification of the use and density provisions may be
accomplished only through a rezoning of the property in question or an
amendment to this subchapter; both of which are approved by the Board of
Supervisors.

§ 157.047  CHESAPEAKE BAY PRESERVATION AREA OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The Chesapeake Bay is one of the most important and productive
estuaries in the world, providing economic and social benefits to the citizens
of the county and the state. The health of the Bay is vital to maintaining the
county’s economy and the welfare of its citizens. Economic development and
water quality protection not only may coexist, they must.
      (2)   The Chesapeake Bay waters have been degraded significantly by
several factors including nonpoint source pollution from land uses and
development. Existing high quality waters are worthy of protection from
pollution to guard against further degradation. Certain lands that are
proximate to shorelines have intrinsic water quality value due to the
ecological and biological processes they perform. Other lands have severe
development constraints from flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. With
proper management, they offer significant ecological benefits by providing
water quality maintenance and pollution control, as well as flood and shoreline
erosion control. These lands together, designated by the county as Chesapeake
Bay Preservation Areas (hereinafter “CBPAs”), need to be protected from
destruction and damage in order to protect the quality of water in the Bay and
consequently the quality of life in the county and the state.
   (B)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   This Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay District is created
to implement the requirements of VA Code §§ 10.1-2100 et seq. (the Chesapeake
Bay Preservation Act). The intent of the County Board of Supervisors and the
purpose of this Overlay District are to: protect existing high quality state
waters; restore all other state waters to a condition or quality that will
permit all reasonable public uses and will support the propagation and growth
of all aquatic life, including game fish, which might reasonably be expected to
inhabit them; safeguard the clean waters of the state from pollution; prevent
any increase in pollution; reduce existing pollution; and promote water
resource conservation in order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare
of the present and future citizens of the county.
      (2)   This Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay District shall be in
addition to and shall overlay all other zoning districts so that any parcel of
land lying in the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay District shall also
lie in one or more of the other zoning districts provided for by this chapter.
Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, the review and approval procedures
provided for in the Subdivision (
Chapter 154), Erosion and Sediment Control (
Chapter 152), Wetlands (
Chapter 156), and Floodplain Management (
Chapter 151) chapters as adopted by the county, shall be followed in reviewing
and approving development, redevelopment, and uses within this Overlay
District.
      (3)   This Overlay District is created under the authority of VA Code §§
10.1-2100 et seq. (the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act).

   (D)   Areas of applicability.
      (1)   The Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Overlay District includes all
lands identified as CBPAs as designated by the County Board of Supervisors and
as shown on the County Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Map. The County
Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Map, together with all explanatory matter
thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
section.
         (a)   The resource protection area (RPA), as delineated on the County
Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Map, includes:
            1.   Tidal wetlands;
            2.   Nontidal wetlands connected by surface flow and contiguous to
tidal wetlands or waterbodies with perennial flow;
            3.   Tidal shores; and
            4.   A 100-foot vegetated buffer area located adjacent to and
landward of the components listed in divisions (D)(1)(a)1. through (D)(1)(a)3.
above, and along both sides of any waterbody with perennial flow.
         (b)   The resource management area (RMA) includes all areas of the
county not included in the resource protection area. These areas include land
types that, if improperly used or developed, have a potential for causing
significant water quality degradation or for diminishing the functional value
of the resource protection area. The following land categories were considered
by the county in establishing the resource management area:
            1.   Floodplains;
            2.   Highly erodible soils, including steep slopes;
            3.   Highly permeable soils;
            4.   Nontidal wetlands not included in the resource protection
area; and
            5.   Other lands adjacent to or in close proximity to lands
aforementioned in this paragraph, which are necessary to protect the quality of
state waters.
      (2)   The County Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Map shows only the
general location of CBPAs and should be consulted by persons contemplating
activities within the county prior to engaging in a regulated activity. The
specific location of RPAs on a lot or parcel shall be delineated on each site
or parcel as required under division (L) below through the review and approval
of the plan of development process or as required under division (K) below
through the review and approval of a water quality impact assessment.
      (3)   Portions of RPAs and RMAs designated by the County Board of
Supervisors as intensely developed areas shall serve as redevelopment areas.
Areas so designated shall comply with all erosion and sediment control
requirements and the performance standards for redevelopment in division (J)
below.
      (4)   If the boundaries of a Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area include
only a portion of a lot, parcel, or development project, the entire lot,
parcel, or development project shall comply with the requirements of this
Overlay District. The division of property shall not constitute an exemption
from this requirement.
   (E)   Use regulations. Permitted uses, special exception uses, accessory
uses, and special requirements shall be as established by the underlying zoning
district, unless specifically modified by the requirements set forth herein.
   (F)   Development criteria for resource protection areas (RPAs).
      (1)   Land disturbance or development in resource protection areas may be
allowed only when permitted by the Land Use Administrator and if it: is water-
dependent; constitutes redevelopment; constitutes development or redevelopment
within a designated intensely developed area; is a new use subject to the
provisions of division (J)(3)(e) below; or is a road or driveway crossing
satisfying the conditions set forth in division (F)(1)(c) below.
         (a)   A new or expanded water-dependent facility may be allowed
provided that the following criteria are met:
            1.   It does not conflict with the Comprehensive Plan;
            2.   It complies with the performance standards set forth in
division (J) below;
            3.   Any non-water-dependent component is located outside of the
RPA; and
            4.   Access to the water-dependent facility will be provided with
the minimum disturbance necessary. Where practicable, a single point of access
will be provided.
         (b)   Redevelopment on isolated redevelopment sites outside of locally
designated intensely developed area sites shall be permitted only if there is
no increase in the amount of impervious cover and no further encroachment
within the RPA and it conforms to the stormwater management requirements
outlined under division (J)(2)(h) below and the erosion and sediment control
requirements outlined under division (J)(2)(d) below.
         (c)   Roads and driveways not exempt under division (N) below and
which comply with the provisions of this chapter, may be constructed in or
across the RPAs if each of the following conditions are met:
            1.   The Land Use Administrator makes a finding that there are no
reasonable alternatives to aligning the road or drive in or across the RPA;
            2.   The alignment and design of the road or driveway are
optimized, consistent with other applicable requirements, to minimize
encroachment in the RPA and minimize adverse effects on water quality;
            3.   The design and construction of the road or driveway satisfy
all applicable criteria of this chapter; and
            4.   The Land Use Administrator reviews the plan for the road or
driveway proposed in or across the RPA in coordination with the plan of
development requirements as required under division (L) below or Chapter 154 of
this code.
      (2)   A water quality impact assessment, as outlined in division (K)
below, shall be required for any proposed land disturbance, development, or
redevelopment within RPAs and for any development within RMAs when required by
the Land Use Administrator because of the unique characteristics of the site or
intensity of development.
   (G)   Lot size. Lot size shall be subject to the requirements of the
underlying zoning district(s), provided that any lot shall have sufficient area
outside the resource protection area to accommodate an intended development, in
accordance with the performance standards in division (J) below, when such
development is not otherwise allowed in the RPA.
   (H)   Conflict with other regulations. In any case where the requirements of
this Overlay District conflict with any other adopted land use regulations of
the county or existing state or federal regulations, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall apply.
   (I)   Interpretation of resource protection area boundaries.
      (1)   Delineation by the applicant. The site-specific boundaries of the
resource protection area shall be determined by the applicant through the
performance of an environmental site assessment, subject to approval by the
Land Use Administrator and in accordance with divisions (K) and (L) below. The
County Chesapeake Bay Preservation Area Map may be used as a guide to the
general location of resource protection areas.
      (2)   Delineation by the Land Use Administrator. The Land Use
Administrator, when requested by an applicant wishing to construct a single-
family residence, may waive the requirement for an environmental site
assessment and perform the delineation. The Land Use Administrator may use
remote sensing, hydrology, soils, plant species, and other data, and consult
other appropriate resources as needed to perform the delineation. If the Land
Use Administrator is unable to accomplish an adequate delineation, the
applicant may be required to provide a site-specific RPA boundary delineation.
      (3)   Where conflict arises over delineation. Where the applicant has
provided a site-specific delineation of the RPA, the Land Use Administrator
shall verify the accuracy of the boundary delineation. In determining the site-
specific RPA boundary, the Land Use Administrator may render adjustments to the
applicant’s boundary delineation, in accordance with division (L) below. In the
event the adjusted boundary delineation is contested by the applicant, the
applicant may seek relief, in accordance with the provisions of division (L)(8)
below.
   (J)   Performance standards.
      (1)   Purpose and intent.
         (a)   The performance standards establish the means to minimize
erosion and sedimentation potential, reduce land application of nutrients and
toxics, and maximize rainwater infiltration. Natural ground cover, especially
woody vegetation, is most effective in holding soil in place and preventing
site erosion. Indigenous vegetation, with its adaptability to local conditions
without the use of harmful fertilizers or pesticides, filters stormwater
runoff. Minimizing impervious cover enhances rainwater infiltration and
effectively reduces stormwater runoff potential.
         (b)   The purpose and intent of these requirements is also to
implement the following objectives: prevent a net increase in nonpoint source
pollution from new development; achieve a 10% reduction in nonpoint source
pollution from redevelopment; and achieve a 40% reduction in nonpoint source
pollution from agricultural uses.
      (2)   General performance standards for development and redevelopment.
         (a)   Land disturbance shall be limited to the area necessary to
provide for the proposed use or development.
            1.   In accordance with an approved site plan, the limits of land
disturbance, including clearing or grading, shall be strictly defined by the
construction footprint through the plan of development process. These limits
shall be clearly shown on submitted plans and physically marked on the
development site.
            2.   Ingress and egress during construction shall be limited to one
access point, unless otherwise approved by the Land Use Administrator.
         (b)   Indigenous vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent
practicable consistent with the proposed use and development permitted and in
accordance with the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
            1.   Existing trees over ten inches diameter at breast height
(d.b.h.) shall be preserved outside the construction footprint. Other woody
vegetation on-site shall also be preserved, to the extent practicable, outside
the approved construction footprint.
            2.   Site clearing for construction activities shall be allowed as
approved by the Land Use Administrator through the plan of development review
process outlined under division (L) below.
            3.   Prior to clearing or grading, suitable protective barriers,
such as safety fencing, shall be erected five feet outside of the dripline of
any tree or stand of trees to be preserved. These protective barriers shall
remain so erected throughout all phases of construction. The storage of
equipment, materials, debris, or fill shall not be allowed within the area
protected by the barrier.
         (c)   Land development shall minimize impervious cover consistent with
the proposed use or development.
            1.   Grid and modular pavement use shall be encouraged for any
required parking area, alley or other low traffic driveway.
            2.   Parking space size shall be the minimum necessary to safely
accommodate the anticipated parking load.
         (d)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or
exceptions or exemptions thereto, any land-disturbing activity exceeding 2,500
square feet, including construction of all single-family houses, septic tanks,
and drain fields, shall comply with the requirements of
Chapter 152 of this code of ordinances.
         (e)   All development and redevelopment exceeding 2,500 square feet of
land disturbance shall be subject to a plan of development process, including
the approval of a site plan in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 153 of this code of ordinances; or a subdivision plat in accordance
with
Chapter 154 of this code of ordinances; or a water quality impact assessment in
accordance with division (K) below.
         (f)   All on-site sewage disposal systems not requiring a VPDES permit
shall be pumped out at least once every five years, in accordance with the
regulations of the State Department of Health. As alternatives to pump-out:
            1.   An effluent filter may be installed and maintained in the
outflow pipe from a septic tank as long as the filter satisfies the standards
established in the sewage handling and disposal regulations under 12 VAC 5-610
et seq., as administered by the State Department of Health; or
            2.   Owners of on-site sewage treatment systems may submit
documentation, every five years, certified by a sewage handler permitted by the
State Department of Health, that the septic system has been inspected, is
functioning properly, and does not need to be pumped out.
         (g)   1.   A reserve sewage disposal site with a capacity at least
equal to that of the primary sewage disposal site shall be provided, in
accordance with the regulations of the State Department of Health. This
requirement shall not apply to any lot recorded prior to October 1, 1989, if
such lot is not sufficient in capacity to accommodate a reserve sewage disposal
site, as determined by the local Health Department. Building or construction of
any impervious surface shall be prohibited on the area of all sewage disposal
sites until the structure is served by public sewer or an on-site sewage
treatment system, which operates under a permit issued by the State Water
Control Board.
            2.   As an alternative to the 100% reserve sewage disposal site, an
alternating drain field system may be provided, which meets the following
conditions.
               a.   Each of the two alternating drain fields in the system
shall have, at a minimum, an area not less than 50% of the area that would
otherwise be required if a single primary drain field were constructed.
               b.   An area equaling 50% of the area that would otherwise be
required for the primary drain field site must be reserved for subsurface
absorption systems that utilize a flow diversion device, in order to provide
for future replacement or repair to meet the requirements for a sewage disposal
system. Expansion of the primary system shall require an expansion of this
reserve area.
               c.   The two alternating drain fields shall be connected by a
diversion valve, approved by the local Health Department, located in the pipe
between the septic tank and the distribution boxes. The diversion valve shall
be used to alternate the direction of effluent flow to one drain field or the
other at a time.
               d.   Diversion valves shall not be used for the following types
of treatment systems: sand mounds; low-pressure distribution systems; repair
situations when installation of a valve is not feasible; and any other approved
system for which the use of a valve would adversely affect the design of the
system, as determined by the local Health Department.
               e.   The diversion valve shall be a three-port, two-way valve of
approved materials (i.e., resistant to sewage and leakproof and designed so
that the effluent from the tank can be directed to flow into either one of the
two distribution boxes).
               f.   There shall be a conduit from the top of the valve to the
ground surface with an appropriate cover to be level with or above the ground
surface.
               g.   The valve shall not be located in driveways, recreational
courts, parking lots, or beneath sheds or other structures.
               h.   In lieu of the aforementioned diversion valve, any device
that can be designed and constructed to conveniently direct the flow of
effluent from the tank into either one of the two distribution boxes may be
approved if plans are submitted to the Local Health Department and found to be
satisfactory.
               i.   The local government shall require that the owner(s)
alternate the drain fields every 12 months to permit the yearly resting of half
of the absorption system.
               j.   The local government shall ensure that the owner(s) are
notified annually of the requirement to switch the valve to the opposite drain
field.
         (h)   For any development or redevelopment, stormwater runoff shall be
controlled by the use of best management practices consistent with the water
quality protection provisions of the State Stormwater Management Regulations (4
VAC 3-20-10 et seq.).
            1.   For development, the post-development nonpoint source
pollution runoff load shall not exceed the predevelopment load, based on the
calculated average land cover condition for the state’s Chesapeake Bay
Watershed.
            2.   For sites within intensely developed areas or other isolated
redevelopment sites, the nonpoint source pollution load shall be reduced by at
least 10%. The Land Use Administrator may waive or modify this requirement for
redevelopment sites that originally incorporated best management practices for
stormwater runoff quality control, provided the following provisions are
satisfied:
               a.   In no case may the post-development nonpoint source
pollution runoff load exceed the predevelopment load;
               b.   Runoff pollution loads must have been calculated and the
BMPs selected for the expressed purpose of controlling nonpoint source
pollution; and
               c.   If best management practices are structural, evidence shall
be provided that facilities are currently in good working order and performing
at the design levels of service. The Land Use Administrator may require a
review of both the original structure design and maintenance plans to verify
this provision. A new maintenance agreement may be required to ensure
compliance with this chapter.
            3.   For redevelopment, both the pre- and post-development loadings
shall be calculated by the same procedures. However, where the design data is
available, the original post-development nonpoint source pollution loadings can
be substituted for the existing development loadings.
         (i)   Prior to initiating grading or other on-site activities on any
portion of a lot or parcel, all wetlands permits required by federal, state,
and local laws and regulations shall be obtained and evidence of such submitted
to the Land Use Administrator, in accordance with division (L) below.
         (j)   Land upon which agricultural activities are being conducted
shall have a soil and water quality conservation assessment conducted that
evaluates the effectiveness of existing practices pertaining to soil erosion
and sediment control, nutrient management, and management of pesticides, and,
where necessary, results in a plan that outlines additional practices needed to
ensure that water quality protection is being accomplished consistent with this
chapter and the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (VA Code §§ 10.1-2100 et seq.).
      (3)   Buffer area requirements.
         (a)   To minimize the adverse effects of human activities on the other
components of resource protection areas, state waters, and aquatic life, a 100-
foot buffer area of vegetation that is effective in retarding runoff,
preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff shall
be retained if present and established where it does not exist.
         (b)   The buffer area shall be located adjacent to and landward of
other RPA components and along both sides of any waterbody with perennial flow.
The full buffer area shall be designated as the landward component of the RPA,
in accordance with division (D) above and division (L) below. Notwithstanding
permitted encroachments and modifications, as set forth in this section, the
100-foot wide buffer area is not reduced in width.
         (c)   The 100-foot buffer area shall be deemed to achieve a 75%
reduction of sediments and a 40% reduction of nutrients.
         (d)   In order to maintain the functional value of the buffer area,
indigenous vegetation may be removed, subject to approval by the Land Use
Administrator, only to provide for reasonable sight lines, access paths,
general woodlot management, and best management practices (including those that
prevent upland erosion and concentrated flows of stormwater), as follows:
            1.   Trees may be pruned or removed as necessary to provide for
sight lines and vistas, provided that where removed, they shall be replaced
with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing
erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff;
            2.   Any path shall be constructed and surfaced so as to
effectively control erosion;
            3.   Dead, diseased, or dying trees or shrubbery and noxious weeds
(such as Johnsongrass, kudzu, multiflora rose, and Phragmites australis) may be
removed and thinning of trees allowed as permitted by the Land Use
Administrator pursuant to sound horticultural practices; and
            4.   For shoreline erosion control projects, trees and woody
vegetation may be removed, necessary control techniques employed, and
appropriate vegetation established to protect or stabilize the shoreline in
accordance with the best available technical advice and applicable permit
conditions or requirements.
         (e)   When the application of the buffer areas would result in the
loss of a buildable area on a lot recorded prior to October 1, 1989, the Land
Use Administrator may, through an administrative process, allow encroachment
into the buffer area in accordance with division (L) below and the following
criteria:
            1.   Encroachments into the buffer areas shall be the minimum
necessary to achieve a reasonable buildable area for a principal structure and
necessary utilities;
            2.   Where practicable, a vegetated area that will maximize water
quality protection, mitigate the effect of the encroachment, and is equal to
the area encroaching the buffer area shall be established elsewhere on the lot
or parcel; and
            3.   The encroachment shall not extend into the seaward 50-feet of
the buffer area.
         (f)   Redevelopment within IDAs may be exempt from the buffer area, in
accordance with division (L) below.
         (g)   On agricultural lands, the agricultural buffer area shall be
managed to prevent concentrated flows of surface water from breaching the
buffer area and appropriate measures may be taken to prevent noxious weeds
(such as Johnsongrass, kudzu, multiflora rose, and Phragmites australis) from
invading the buffer area. Agricultural activities may encroach into the buffer
area as follows.
            1.   Agricultural activities may encroach into the landward 50 feet
of the 100-foot wide buffer area when at least one agricultural best management
practice which, in the opinion of the local Soil and Water Conservation
District Board, addresses the more predominant water quality issue on the
adjacent land (erosion control or nutrient management) is being implemented on
the adjacent land, provided that the combination of the undisturbed buffer area
and the best management practice achieves water quality protection, pollutant
removal, and water resource conservation at least the equivalent of the 100-
foot wide buffer area. If nutrient management is identified as the predominant
water quality issue, a nutrient management plan, including soil tests, must be
developed consistent with the State Nutrient Training and Certification
Regulations (4 VAC 5-15) administered by the State Department of Conservation
and Recreation.
            2.   Agricultural activities may encroach within the landward 75
feet of the 100-foot wide buffer area when agricultural best management
practices which address erosion control, nutrient management, and pest chemical
control, are being implemented on the adjacent land. The erosion control
practices must prevent erosion from exceeding the soil loss tolerance level,
referred to as “T”, as defined in the National Soil Survey Handbook of November
1996 in the Field Office Technical Guide of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Natural Resource Conservation Service. A nutrient management plan, including
soil tests, must be developed, consistent with the State Nutrient Management
Training and Certification Regulations (4 VAC 5-15) administered by the State
Department of Conservation and Recreation. In conjunction with the remaining
buffer area, this collection of best management practices shall be presumed to
achieve water quality protection at least the equivalent of that provided by
the 100-foot wide buffer area.
            3.   The buffer area is not required to be designated adjacent to
agricultural drainage ditches if at least one best management practice which,
in the opinion of the local Soil and Water Conservation District Board,
addresses the more predominant water quality issue on the adjacent land
(erosion control or nutrient management) is being implemented on the adjacent
land.
         (h)   Where land uses such as agriculture or silviculture within the
area of the buffer cease and the lands are proposed to be converted to other
uses, the full 100-foot wide buffer shall be reestablished. In reestablishing
the buffer, management measures shall be undertaken to provide woody vegetation
that assures the buffer functions set forth in this chapter.
   (K)   Water quality impact assessment.
      (1)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the water quality impact
assessment is to: identify the impacts of proposed land disturbance,
development, or redevelopment on water quality and lands within RPAs and other
environmentally sensitive lands; ensure that, where land disturbance,
development, or redevelopment does take place within RPAs and other sensitive
lands, it will be located on those portions of a site and in a manner that will
be least disruptive to the natural functions of RPAs and other sensitive lands;
to protect individuals from investing funds for improvements proposed for
location on lands unsuited for such development because of high groundwater,
erosion, or vulnerability to flood and storm damage; specify mitigation which
will address water quality protection; and provide for administrative relief
from terms of this Overlay District when warranted and in accordance with the
requirements contained herein.
      (2)   Applicability. A water quality impact assessment shall be required
for: any proposed land disturbance, development, or redevelopment activity
within a resource protection area as permitted consistent with division (F)
above; for any buffer area encroachment as provided for in division (J)(3)(e)
above; or for any other development in resource management areas as deemed
necessary by the Land Use Administrator due to the unique characteristics of
the site or intensity of the proposed use or development. There shall be two
levels of water quality impact assessments: a minor assessment; and a major
assessment.
      (3)   Minor water quality impact assessment. A minor water quality impact
assessment pertains only to land disturbance, development, or redevelopment
within the CBPAs, which causes no more than 5,000 square feet of land
disturbance and requires any encroachment into the landward 50 feet of the 100-
foot buffer area as permitted under division (J) above. A minor assessment must
demonstrate through acceptable calculations that the undisturbed buffer area,
enhanced vegetative plantings, and necessary best management practices will
result in removal of no less than 75% of sediments and 40% of nutrients from
post-development stormwater runoff and that will retard runoff, prevent
erosion, and filter nonpoint source pollution the equivalent of the full
undisturbed 100-foot buffer area. A minor assessment shall include a site
drawing to scale, which shows the following:
         (a)   Location of the components of the RPA, including the 100-foot
buffer area;
         (b)   Location and nature of the proposed encroachment into the buffer
area, including: type of paving material; areas of clearing or grading;
location of any structures, drives, or other impervious cover; and sewage
disposal systems or reserve drain field sites;
         (c)   Type and location of proposed best management practices to
mitigate the proposed encroachment;
         (d)   Location of existing vegetation on-site, including the number
and type of trees and other vegetation to be removed in the buffer to
accommodate the encroachment or modification; and
         (e)   Revegetation plan that supplements the existing buffer
vegetation in a manner that provides for pollutant removal, erosion, and runoff
control.
      (4)   Major water quality impact assessment.
         (a)   A major water quality impact assessment shall be required for
any land disturbance, development, or redevelopment which: exceeds 5,000 square
feet of land disturbance within CBPAs and requires any encroachment into the
landward 50 feet of the 100-foot buffer area; disturbs any portion of any other
component of an RPA or disturbs any portion of the buffer area within 50 feet
of any other component of an RPA; or is located in an RMA and is deemed
necessary by the Land Use Administrator. The information required in this
division (K)(4) shall be considered a minimum, unless the Land Use
Administrator determines that some of the elements are unnecessary due to the
scope and nature or the proposed use and development of the land.
         (b)   The following elements shall be included in the preparation and

information, as required by divisions (K)(3) and (K)(4) above, shall be
submitted to the Land Use Administrator for review.
         (b)   All information required in this division (K)(5) shall be
certified as complete and accurate by a professional engineer or a certified
surveyor.
         (c)   A minor water quality impact assessment shall be prepared and
submitted to and reviewed by the Land Use Administrator in conjunction with a
site plan.
         (d)   A major water quality impact assessment shall be prepared and
submitted to and reviewed by the Land Use Administrator in conjunction with a
request for rezoning, special exception, or in conjunction with division (L)
below, as deemed necessary by the Land Use Administrator.
         (e)   As part of any major water quality impact assessment submittal,
the Land Use Administrator may require review by the Chesapeake Bay Local
Assistance Department (CBLAD). Upon receipt of a major water quality impact
assessment, the Land Use Administrator will determine if such review is
warranted and may request CBLAD to review the assessment and respond with
written comments. Any comments by CBLAD shall be incorporated into the final
review by the Land Use Administrator, provided that such comments are provided
by CBLAD within 90 days of the request.
      (6)   Evaluation procedure.
         (a)   Upon the complete review of a minor water quality impact
assessment, the Land Use Administrator shall determine if any proposed
modification or encroachment into the buffer area is consistent with the
provisions of this chapter and make a finding based upon the following
criteria:
            1.   The necessity of the proposed encroachment and the ability to
place improvements elsewhere on the site to avoid disturbance of the buffer
area;
            2.   Impervious surface is minimized;
            3.   Proposed mitigation measures, including the revegetation plan
and site design, result in minimal disturbance to all components of the RPA,
including the 100-foot buffer area;
            4.   Proposed mitigation measures will work to retain all buffer
area functions: pollutant removal, erosion, and runoff control;
            5.   Proposed best management practices, where required, achieve
the requisite reductions in pollutant loadings;
            6.   The development, as proposed, meets the purpose and intent of
this chapter; and
            7.   The cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
considered in relation to other development in the vicinity, both existing and
proposed, will not result in a significant degradation of water quality.
         (b)   Upon the completed review of a major water quality impact
assessment, the Land Use Administrator shall determine if the proposed
development is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter and make
a finding based upon the following criteria:
            1.   Within any RPA, the proposed development is water-dependent or
redevelopment;
            2.   The percentage of existing wetlands disturbed by the
development. The number of square feet or acres to be disturbed;
            3.   The development will not result in significant disruption of
the hydrology of the site;
            4.   The development will not result in unnecessary destruction of
plant materials on-site;
            5.   Proposed erosion and sediment control concepts are adequate to
achieve the reductions in runoff and prevent off-site sedimentation;
            6.   Proposed stormwater management concepts are adequate to
control the stormwater runoff to achieve no net increase in pollutant loadings;
            7.   Proposed revegetation of disturbed areas will provide optimum
erosion and sediment control benefits, as well as runoff control and pollutant
removal equivalent of the full 100-foot undisturbed buffer area;
            8.   The design and location of any proposed drain field will be in
accordance with the requirements of division (J) above; and
            9.   The development, as proposed, is consistent with the purpose
and intent of this Overlay District.
         (c)   The Land Use Administrator shall require additional mitigation
where potential impacts have not been adequately addressed. Evaluation of
mitigation measures will be made by the Land Use Administrator on the criteria
listed above in divisions (K)(6)(a) and (K)(6)(b) above.
         (d)   The Land Use Administrator shall find the proposal to be
inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter when the impacts
created by the proposal cannot be mitigated. Evaluation of the impacts shall be
made by the Land Use Administrator based on the criteria listed above in
divisions (K)(6)(a) and (K)(6)(b) above.
   (L)   Plan of development process. Any land disturbance, development, or
redevelopment exceeding 2,500 square feet of land disturbance shall be
accomplished through a plan of development process prior to any clearing or
grading of the site or the issuance of any building permit, to assure
compliance with all applicable requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   Required information.
         (a)   In addition to the requirements of
Chapter 153 of this code of ordinances or the requirements of
Chapter 154 of this code of ordinances, the plan of development process shall
consist of the plans and studies identified below. These required plans and
studies may be coordinated or combined, as deemed appropriate by the Land Use
Administrator. The Land Use Administrator may determine that some of the
following information is unnecessary due to the scope and nature of the
proposed development.
         (b)   The following plans or studies shall be submitted, unless
otherwise provided for:

         (c)   The environmental site assessment shall delineate the site-
specific geographic extent of the RPA on the specific site or parcel as
required under division (D)(2) above.
         (d)   The environmental site assessment shall be drawn at the same
scale as the preliminary site plan or subdivision plat, and shall be certified
as complete and accurate by a professional engineer, a certified land surveyor,
or a certified landscape architect. This certification requirement of the
environmental site assessment may be waived by the Land Use Administrator when
the proposed use of development would result in less than 5,000 square feet of
disturbed area.
      (3)   Landscaping plan.
         (a)   A landscaping plan shall be submitted in conjunction with
preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision plat approval. No clearing or

ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES
§ 157.060  PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Duties of the Land Use Administrator. The Land Use Administrator shall
be responsible for coordination of the development review and decision-making
process. These responsibilities include:
      (1)   Administering and enforcing the zoning, subdivision, development
design, and implementation provisions of this chapter;
      (2)   Maintaining an accurate record of all amendments to the text and
maps of this chapter;
      (3)   Receiving and reviewing all applications for completeness and
compliance with this chapter submitted to the county for development permits;
      (4)   Determining which decision-making procedure (DMP) is specified by
this chapter as the appropriate decision-making process, and facilitating the
processing of every application;
      (5)   Determining which local, state, and federal agencies may be able to
provide relevant information thereby ensuring a thorough and complete review of
every application and advising those agencies which may want knowledge of an
issued permit;
      (6)   Providing staff support to and enforcing all decisions made by the
Board of Supervisors, Board of Zoning Appeals, Planning Commission, Historic
District Review Committee, and Wetlands Board;
      (7)   Notifying the applicant by written notice of an approval, approval
with conditions, or denial within ten days of final action;
      (8)   Conducting inspections of buildings and other structures, and uses
of land to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
      (9)   Performing such other duties and functions as are required by the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Decision-making paths (DMPs). Five different types of decision-making
paths (DMPs) are necessary in order to administer the provisions of this
chapter. These five DMPs are explained below and depicted in §§
157.076 through
157.078. Decisions made under these DMPs may be appealed in accordance with §
157.063.
      (1)   Administrative approval - DMP-A. This decision-making path relates
to all development approvals which are issued administratively by staff and do
not require approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA), Board of Supervisors
(Board), or any other board or commission appointed by the Board. An
application under DMP-A will be processed without a public hearing or
notification of adjacent property owners. Staff may solicit input from other
agencies, departments, boards, commissions, and citizens as deemed necessary.
Although it is the intent of the county to review applications with as little
delay as possible, some applications may require referral to other agencies.
However, a decision shall always be rendered within 60 days of the date a
complete application is submitted.
      (2)   Board of Supervisors approval after a public hearing - DMP-B.
         (a)   This decision-making path relates to all development approvals
granted by the Board of Supervisors after the conduct of a public hearing. This
DMP will involve the solicitation of comments and recommendations from staff,
local boards and commissions, and other governmental entities before a final
decision is made. Public hearings shall be held after public notice is provided
in accordance with the public notice provisions of §
157.062.
         (b)   The Land Use Administrator shall forward a complete application
to the Commission which shall hold at least one public hearing in accordance
with the public notice requirements of §
157.062. Following the hearing, the Planning Commission shall prepare and by
motion approve its recommendation, which may include changes to the original
application proposal, and transmit such recommendations, together with any
explanatory materials, to the Board of Supervisors. The Planning Commission’s
recommendation shall state the public purposes upon which its recommendation is
premised. Failure of the Planning Commission to submit a recommendation to the
Board of Supervisors within 90 days of the first meeting of the Commission
after the application had been referred to it shall be deemed as a
recommendation for approval, unless the application is withdrawn by the
applicant prior to the expiration of such time period. The Board will conduct a
public hearing advertised in accordance with the public notice provisions
specified in §
157.062. Approval or denial by the Board shall occur within 45 days after
receipt of all state approvals or 90 days after submission of a complete
application, whichever is greater. The applicant may relieve the Board and
Planning Commission of rendering a decision within the time periods provided if
done so in writing prior to the expiration of the time period.
      (3)   Board of Supervisors approval, public hearing not required - DMP-C.
This decision-making path relates to all development approvals granted by the
Board of Supervisors which do not require a public hearing. DMP-C may involve
the solicitation of comments and recommendations from staff, local boards and
commissions, and other governmental entities before a final decision is made.
      (4)   Board of Zoning Appeals’ approval - DMP-D. This decision-making
path relates to all zoning appeals and requests granted by the Board of Zoning
Appeals (BZA). DMP-D involves the conduct of a public hearing after public
notice has been provided in accordance with the public notice provisions of §
157.062. Solicitation of comments and recommendations from the Planning
Commission is mandatory before a decision is rendered. Comments and
recommendations may also be solicited from staff, local boards and commissions,
and other governmental entities before a final decision is made.
      (5)   Wetlands Board approval - DMP-E. This decision-making path relates
to all development approvals granted by the Wetlands Board. The Wetlands Board
conducts a public hearing not later than 60 days after receipt of an
application for a proposed regulated activity within tidal wetland areas.
Public hearings are conducted after public notice has been provided in
accordance with the public hearing provisions of §
157.062. It is mandatory that the applicant, the Board of Supervisors, the
Commissioner of the State Marine Resources Commission, the owner of record of
any land adjacent to the wetlands in question, the State Institute of Marine
Science, the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, the Department of
Environmental Quality, the Department of Transportation, the Army Corps of
Engineers, and any governmental agencies expressing an interest therein be
notified of the hearing by mail not less than 20 days prior to the date set for
the hearing. Solicitation of comments and recommendations from staff, local
boards and commissions, and other governmental entities occurs before a final
decision is made.

      (5)   Additional information required by other sections of this chapter
because of the type of development proposed, the area involved, or the impact
associated with the request.
   (D)   Use of a resource inventory for predevelopment planning and design
required with every application for development.
      (1)   Unless waived in whole or in part as provided by division (G)
below, all applications shall be accompanied by a resource inventory for
predevelopment planning and design (resource inventory). The resource inventory
shall consist of a composite inventory map of the site’s significant and
sensitive natural and cultural resources. The decisions rendered by the county
in consideration of applications for development will be based in large part on
the sensitivity of the applicant’s proposal as it relates to these significant
and sensitive features. The county will look most favorably upon development
proposals which preserve, protect, and accommodate resources through the
careful positioning and placement of land development activities away from
these resources.
      (2)   This map will be generated by the county resource information
system, a computer database, and provided to prospective applicants upon
request and in return for payment of the prescribed fee. Prospective applicants
are encouraged to secure this information from the Land Use Administrator at
the pre-application conference (division (B) above) so it can be used as a
basis for the development of sketch plats/plans (division (H) below) and
subsequent submittals. Resource factors included in the resource inventory for
predevelopment planning and design are tidal wetlands, tidal shores, connected
and non-connected nontidal wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes, highly erodible
and permeable soils, historic and archaeological sites, septic suitability,
prime agricultural and forestlands, significant habitat areas, and significant
viewsheds. The Land Use Administrator/plan-approving authority may require
original fieldwork particularly as it relates to RPA delineation if deemed
necessary in order to ensure the highest level of accuracy.
   (E)   Submission of a complete development permit application. Application
materials shall be submitted to the Land Use Administrator, who shall indicate
the date of submission on the application. Within ten working days after the
date of submission, the Land Use Administrator shall determine whether an
application is sufficiently complete to be forwarded along the proper DMP. If
the Land Use Administrator determines that the application is incomplete or the
necessary attachments have not been submitted, he or she shall immediately
notify the applicant of this negative determination by mail or otherwise convey
an explanation to the applicant. An application for which a negative
determination has been made may be resubmitted (without charge if the original
fee submission was as required) after it is revised to overcome the reasons for
the negative determination. If a development permit application is in
conformance with the submission provisions of this chapter, the Land Use
Administrator shall accept it, deem it to be complete, note the date of
acceptance, assign an application number, and initiate application processing
in accordance with the appropriate DMP.
   (F)   Documents to be submitted.
      (1)   The documents to be submitted are intended to provide the plan-
approving authority with sufficient information and data to ensure that the
proposed development meets the zoning, and design and improvement standards
contained in this chapter. The documents to be submitted will vary depending
upon the nature of the development request and the approvals required to be
obtained. The documents and details to be submitted are indicated within §
157.079.
      (2)   The potential impact of certain development proposals on the
county, as well as any development in close proximity to naturally or
culturally significant areas, may require a more detailed level of scrutiny on
the part of the plan-approving authority. If it is deemed that a project may be
of potential negative impact which would compromise the integrity of the
Comprehensive Plan, or be inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter as
stated in §
157.003 or with the overall spirit of this chapter, the plan-approving
authority may require the submission of a community impact analysis. The
precise content of a community impact analysis will be made specific by the
plan-approving authority in response to the specific concerns it has with the
development proposal. However, the scope of issues which the plan-approving
authority could request the applicant to address include, but are not limited
to:
         (a)   Archaeological and historic surveys;
         (b)   Cultural and natural resource impact studies;
         (c)   Fiscal impact analysis;
         (d)   Governmental services impact analysis;
         (e)   Groundwater studies;
         (f)   Residential and commercial market studies defining capacity for
growth and the impact of the proposal on existing markets;
         (g)   Traffic impact analysis; and
         (h)   Utility analysis.
   (G)   Waiver of submission requirements.
      (1)   The Land Use Administrator may waive all or some of the submission
requirements for those applications within DMP-A if he or she has determined
that a complete and thorough review of the application can be accomplished
without submittal data which is absent. The Land Use Administrator shall
document the reasons for waiving submission requirements.
      (2)   The plan-approving authorities within DMP-B to DMP-E will make the
final determination if a waiver from submittal requirements is warranted. The
fact that the Land Use Administrator may label an application within DMP-B to
DMP-E as complete for processing does not preclude the approving entity from
requesting the submission of clarifying information or additional data.
   (H)   Submission of sketch plats and sketch plans. A conceptual sketch of
the proposed subdivision or site plan is not required but is strongly
recommended as an option which may help expedite the review of an application.
The submission of a conceptual sketch affords the applicant the opportunity to
discuss the proposal in its formative stages and receive the advice of the Land
Use Administrator relative to procedural requirements and applicable ordinance
provisions. The applicant shall submit two copies of the sketch along with a
completed application form. The conceptual sketch should contain sufficient
information accurately depicted in order to permit the Land Use Administrator
to responsively and responsibly be of assistance. The Land Use Administrator
shall return a marked up copy of the sketch plat/plan to the applicant
depicting any comments and recommendations. The second copy and accompanying
application form will be retained for filing.
   (I)   Simultaneous review of plats and plans and other requests.
      (1)   Where a proposed subdivision is a part of a development for which
site plan approval is required, the subdivision plat/plan and the site plan
will be reviewed at the same time as nearly as possible under the requirements
of these regulations.
      (2)   With the approval of the plan-approving agent, applications for
preliminary and final approval may be combined into a single submission
requesting final approval.
      (3)   Plats and plans may be approved conditionally pending receipt of
other approvals such as variance relief, wetlands permits, special exceptions,
and the like.
   (J)   Submission of a minor subdivision/site plan.
      (1)   Any applicant requesting approval of a proposed minor subdivision
and/or minor site plan (activities and uses associated with an individual
single-family home) shall submit five copies of the plan required by this
chapter along with a completed application form and the prescribed fee to the
Land Use Administrator.
      (2)   The application will be declared completed or incomplete within ten
days.
      (3)   Final action will be taken by the Land Use Administrator within 30
days if no public hearings are required for simultaneous wetlands applications,
waivers, variance requests, and the like.
   (K)   Submission of a major subdivision/site plan. All major subdivisions
and site plans shall be processed as specified below.
      (1)   General development plan.
         (a)   Applicants of major site plans exceeding ten acres (as measured
by the limits of development), major subdivisions of 25 or more proposed lots,
and residential mixed use applications shall have the option of dividing
preliminary approval into two parts: phase one - general development plan, and
phase two - preliminary approval. This will enable the applicant to present
large scale plans with a description, but not full engineering details as part
of phase one. With conditional phase one approval, the applicant can proceed
with a higher level of confidence to phase two during which significant
engineering expenses are generally incurred.
         (b)   Fifteen sets of all required submission materials shall be
submitted to the Land Use Administrator for distribution to the Planning
Commission. The procedures of DMP-B will be utilized. It may be necessary for
additional sets of original or revised materials to be submitted to facilitate
agency reviews and for the use of the Board after the Planning Commission has
forwarded its recommendation to the Board for final action.
      (2)   Administrative major subdivision/site plan approval.
         (a)   Major subdivisions resulting in the creation of less than 25
lots and/or site plans on areas of less than ten acres (as measured by the
limits of development) may be approved by the Land Use Administrator in
accordance with the procedures of DMP-A. At his or her option, the Land Use
Administrator may refer the application to the Planning Commission for review
and comment and/or to the Board of Supervisors for preliminary approval in
accordance with the procedures of DMP-C. The Board, at its option, may elect to
process such a request in accordance with DMP-B.
         (b)   Five complete sets of submittal materials shall be submitted for
processing in accordance with DMP-A. If DMP-B or DMP-C is utilized, 15 complete
sets shall be submitted.
         (c)   Final approval shall be contingent upon the acceptance of any
required performance and maintenance guarantees as per §
157.065.
      (3)   Major subdivision/site plans approval by the Board of Supervisors.
         (a)   Major preliminary subdivisions resulting in the creation of 25
lots or more, and site plans on areas ten acres or greater in size (as measured
by the limits of development) shall be processed in accordance with DMP-B.
         (b)   Major final plat/plan approval shall be processed in accordance
with DMP-C. Final approval shall be contingent upon the acceptance of any
required performance and maintenance bonds as per §
157.065.
      (4)   Effect of general development plan/preliminary subdivision/site
plan approval.
         (a)   The applicant shall have not more than 12 months after receiving
official notification concerning tentative approval of a general development
plan to submit an application for phase two - preliminary approval. Failure to
do so shall make the general development plan approval null and void. The Land
Use Administrator may grant an extension of this time limit for a total of no
more than one year if requested to do so in writing, provided sufficient
justification is given by the applicant.
         (b)   The applicant shall have not more than six months after
receiving official notification concerning approval of a preliminary plat/plan
to submit an application for final plat/plan approval. Failure to do so shall
make preliminary approval null and void. The Land Use Administrator may grant
an extension of this time limit for a total of not more than one year if
requested in writing, provided sufficient justification is given by the
applicant. Remaining sections of a phased development plan shall not become
null and void as long as final plats/plans are submitted for approval with no
lapse exceeding three years in time between the submittal of final sections.
      (5)   Effect of final approval of subdivisions and site plans.
         (a)   A single black-line print and a film positive of an approved
major final site plan shall be submitted to the Land Use Administrator for
filing. An approved final site plan shall be null and void if, in the opinion
of the Land Use Administrator, no significant work is done or development is
made on the site within 12 months after the date of site plan approval. A
single one-year extension upon written request of the applicant with sufficient
justification may be granted by the Land Use Administrator.
         (b)   Five black-line prints of an approved final subdivision plat
shall be submitted to the Land Use Administrator for signatures. When a final
subdivision plat has been approved, executed, and acknowledged in accordance
with the provisions of this subchapter, it shall be recorded in the office of
the Clerk of Circuit Court of the county within six months after final
approval. No final plat of a subdivision shall be recorded unless and until it
has been submitted to and approved by the county; and no Clerk or Deputy Clerk
of the Circuit Court of the county shall file or record a subdivision plat
until the plat has been approved by the county and unless the plat is submitted
for recordation within six months of the date of final approval by the county.
Unless the approved plat is filed for recordation within six months after final
approval, such approval shall be withdrawn and the plat marked void and
returned to the applicant.
   (L)   Adjustments to approved site plans.
      (1)   After a site plan has been approved, minor adjustments to the site
plan, which comply with the spirit of this chapter and with the general purpose
of the Comprehensive Plan for development of the area, may be approved by the
Land Use Administrator with notice of the change given to the original plan-
approving authorities. Deviation from an approved site plan without the written
approval of the Land Use Administrator shall void the plan and the applicant
shall be required to resubmit a new site plan for consideration.
      (2)   Any major revision of an approved site plan may be made in the same
manner as originally approved and any requirements of this chapter may be
waived by the Land Use Administrator in specific cases where such requirement
is found to be unreasonable and where such waiver will not be adverse to the
purpose of this chapter.
   (M)   Adjustments to approved subdivision plats. No change, erasure, or
revision shall be made on any preliminary or final plat, nor on accompanying
data sheets after approval of the county has been endorsed in writing on the
plat unless authorization for such changes have been granted in writing by the
Land Use Administrator.
   (N)   Wetland permits required before final approval. No final approval will
be granted until evidence of approvals for all wetland permits required by law
are submitted to the Land Use Administrator.

abutting street. If no street abuts the site, at least one sign shall be posted
along the closest public street, with a note added to locate the property in
direction and distance from the sign.
      (3)   Signs shall be maintained in good condition until the public
hearing, and shall be replaced if damaged or removed as soon as practical. It
shall be a violation of this chapter to damage or remove a public notice sign
erected under these provisions, and each sign shall carry a warning to this
effect.
   (E)   The Land Use Administrator, or his or her designee who has performed
notice as prescribed above, shall make affidavit to such and file it with the
papers in the case.

an order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the Land Use
Administrator in the administration or enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter may file an appeal.
         (b)   If the Land Use Administrator’s action was in the administration

157.062.
      (2)   Appeals must be filed within 30 days of the date of the decision by
filing with the Land Use Administrator and the Hearing Board, a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds for appeal. The Land Use Administrator shall
transmit all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was taken to the Hearing Board. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the appealed action unless the Land Use Administrator certifies
to the Hearing Board that by reason of the facts stated in his or her
certificate, a stay would in his or her opinion cause imminent peril to life or
property. In this case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order granted by the Hearing Board or by a court of record, on
application and on notice to the Land Use Administrator and for good cause
shown.
   (B)   Appeals of decisions made by the Board of Supervisors, Board of Zoning
Appeals, and the Wetlands Board. Every action contesting a decision of the

§ 157.064  AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Initiating an amendment.
      (1)   Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare, or
good zoning practice require, the Board of Supervisors may, by ordinance,

agent for the property which is the subject of the proposed amendment.
      (2)   If an application for an amendment has been denied by the Board,
substantially the same petition shall not be reconsidered within 365 days of
the denial. This provision shall not impair the right of either the Planning
Commission or the Board to propose any amendment to this chapter on its own
motion at any time.
   (B)   Processing an amendment request. Amendments shall be processed in
accordance with DMP-B as described in §
157.060(B)(2).
(Ord. passed 11-9-1995)
§ 157.065  PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEES REQUIRED BEFORE FINAL
APPROVALS.
   (A)   Prior to receipt of a final approval for any development activity or
as a condition thereof, all improvements required by this chapter shall be
completed, or provisions made for their completion, in accordance with one of
the following methods:
      (1)   Installation and completion by and at the expense of the developer;
      (2)   The furnishing by the developer to the Land Use Administrator of a
certified check or a personal, corporate, or property bond with cash escrow or
other method of performance guarantee approved by the County Attorney. This
guarantee should be sufficient to cover the cost of all improvements required
to be installed by the developer as estimated by the Land Use Administrator; or
      (3)   The furnishing by the developer to the Land Use Administrator of
evidence of the existence of agreements between the developer and qualified
contractors for the installation and completion of the improvements and the
contractors’ performance guarantees for the benefit of the county and the
developer, and satisfactory to the County Attorney, in an amount sufficient to
cover the cost of all the improvements required to be installed by the
developer as estimated by the Land Use Administrator.
   (B)   In the event that the developer elects to proceed by methods in
divisions (A)(2) or (A)(3) above as outlined in division (A) above, the
developer shall set a time, subject to the approval of the Land Use
Administrator, by which it is estimated the improvements will be installed and
the work in its entirety completed. Unless an extension of that time is
approved by the Land Use Administrator and a new estimated date of
accomplishment and completion of the improvements is established, the county,
at its discretion, may make use of the performance guarantee.
   (C)   Upon the completion of the installation of all improvements, the
developer shall furnish a statement prepared by a certified surveyor or
engineer, to the effect that all construction is in substantial conformity to
the regulations and requirements of this chapter, and the plans as approved by
the county. If this submittal is approved by the county, the bond, escrow, or
other guarantee of completion shall be released within 30 days of receipt of
written notice from the developer to the Land Use Administrator, unless such
developer is notified in writing by the Land Use Administrator of a delay in
such release and the reasons therefor. The county may retain up to 25% of the
bond or other obligation for use in repair of improvements as may be necessary
within one year of completion.
   (D)   Any bond, escrow, or guarantee posted in lieu of payment may be
released in part as construction progresses if approved as partially completed
by the Land Use Administrator and when done in accordance with a predetermined
release schedule.
   (E)   In the event the developer has, in the opinion of the Land Use
Administrator, just cause for not completing the improvements in the entire
development where a satisfactory performance guarantee has been posted, the
Land Use Administrator may release the developer from his or her obligation to
complete all of the improvements in the development, provided the developer
furnishes a statement by a licensed surveyor or engineer to the effect that all
construction which has been completed conforms to the regulations and
requirements of this chapter and the plans as approved by the county.

§ 157.066  CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE, BUILDING PERMITS, AND CERTIFICATES OF
OCCUPANCY.
   (A)   Development permits.
      (1)   Certificate of compliance. The Land Use Administrator will issue a
certificate of compliance for those proposals which have obtained all necessary
approvals and permits and comply with this chapter before any building permits
and certificates of occupancy are issued by the Building Official. Certificates
of compliance will also be issued for all land-disturbing activities, as
defined.
      (2)   Building permits. A building permit shall be required before any
building or other structure may be erected, altered, converted, reconstructed,
relocated, extended, or enlarged. When issued by the Building Official, such
permit shall be valid for not more than six months, unless otherwise provided.
      (3)   Manufactured home; building permit required. No manufactured home
shall be placed for occupancy without the issuance of a building permit from
the Building Official.
      (4)   Existing permits. No building permit lawfully issued prior to the
effective date of this chapter, and in full force and effect at said date,
shall be invalidated by the passage of this chapter, or any amendment, but
shall remain a valid permit, subject only to its own terms and provisions and
ordinances, rules, and regulations pertaining thereto, and in effect at the
time of the issuance of such permit. However, all such permits shall expire not
later than six months from the effective date of this chapter, unless actual
construction shall have begun and continued pursuant to the terms of the
permit.
      (5)   Plans to accompany applications for permits. All applications for a
development permit shall be accompanied by an approved plan resulting from a
positive determination associated with its processing in accordance with §
157.060(B). The Land Use Administrator may waive this requirement for an
approved plan of development in whole or in part when such plan would be
clearly unnecessary to a decision relative to the issuance of a certificate of
compliance.
   (B)   Certificates of occupancy.
      (1)   No building or other structure shall be used, occupied, or changed
in use, until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Building
Official, stating that the building or other structure or proposed use of a
building or other structure complies with the Building Code.
      (2)   A certificate of occupancy shall be applied for along with the
application for a building permit and shall be issued within ten days after the
erection or structural alteration of such buildings or other structures when
completed in accordance with the plans submitted with the application for a
building permit.
      (3)   (a)   A certificate of occupancy may be issued for a part of a
building or other structure or development or section thereof if completed in
accordance with the provisions of the approved plan and the Building Code even
though the entire building or other structure or development or section thereof
has not been completed.
         (b)   The Building Official must find however that such occupancy is
consistent with the public’s health, safety, and welfare.
      (4)   The Building Official may issue a temporary and contingent
certificate of occupancy for a period not to exceed six months where, because
of the unusual nature of the uses, a trial period of operation is, in the Land
Use Administrator’s opinion, the most appropriate way to determine actual
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (5)   The Land Use Administrator may require the applicant to post a
performance guarantee as provided by §
157.065 sufficient to guarantee the completion, by a specific time, of site
improvements related to the buildings and structures for which a certificate is
sought.

§ 157.067  APPLICATION FEES AND ESCROW SCHEDULE.
   Application fees as determined by the Board of Supervisors are to cover the
administrative costs incurred by the county in processing applications and are
nonrefundable. After an application is submitted to the Land Use Administrator,
the applicant may be required to execute an escrow agreement with the county.
The escrow accounts are to pay all necessary and reasonable costs incurred by
the county for the professional review of an application by an engineer,
planning consultant, attorney, and other professionals retained by the county
to review and make recommendations on an application for development. The
amounts specified for escrow are estimates which shall be paid prior to
certification of a complete application. If the amounts posted are more than
those required, the excess funds shall be returned to the applicant within 14
days of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the project. In the
event that more than the amounts specified for escrow are required to pay the
reasonable costs incurred, the applicant shall pay all additional sums required
prior to being permitted to take the next step in the approval procedure or, in
any event, prior to obtaining certificates of occupancy for any element of the
project. The Land Use Administrator shall determine whether there are
sufficient amounts in the escrow fund to pay pending bills. If there are
insufficient funds in escrow, the Land Use Administrator will notify the
applicant of the amounts needed. In addition to these terms, the escrow
agreement may include any additional terms which are agreed to by the applicant
and the Land Use Administrator. The Land Use Administrator shall maintain an
itemized account for each application and shall, upon the request of the
applicant, supply a copy of said account. All charges against any escrow
account shall be made by purchase order and voucher and shall be approved by
the County Administrator.

§ 157.068  VIOLATIONS; ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Violations.
      (1)   In case any lot, building or other structure is erected,
constructed, altered, repaired, converted, or used in violation of this
chapter, the Land Use Administrator shall serve notice on the person committing
or permitting the violation. If the violation has not ceased within a
reasonable time specified by the Land Use Administrator, action appropriate to
terminate the violation shall be taken.
      (2)   Where there is reasonable cause to believe that violation of this
chapter has occurred, the Land Use Administrator or his or her authorized
representative, with the land owners permission (which may include right of
entry language on issued permits) may enter the premises for the purpose of
inspection. Where permission to enter is withheld, the Land Use Administrator
shall seek a court order from the general district court of the county. A
search warrant from a magistrate of the jurisdiction may be issued to
facilitate inspection.
   (B)   Enforcement.
      (1)   The Land Use Administrator shall be vested with all necessary
authority on behalf of the county to administer and enforce this chapter and
any approvals including conditions attached to a rezoning or amendment to a
Zoning Map such as:
         (a)   The order in writing of the remedy of any noncompliance with
such conditions;
         (b)   The bringing of legal action to ensure compliance with such
conditions including injunction, abatement, or other appropriate action or
proceeding; and
         (c)   Requiring the submittal of performance and maintenance
guarantees as specified in §
157.065.
      (2)   (a)   After having served a notice of violation on any person
committing or permitting an infraction of the provisions specified in §
157.999(B)(3) and if this violation has not ceased within the reasonable time
specified in the notice, then upon the approval of the County Attorney, the
Land Use Administrator shall cause two copies of a summons to be served to the
person, either by certified mail (return receipt requested), by hand delivery,
or by posting on the front door of the abode of such person.
         (b)   The summons shall contain the following information:
            1.   The name and address of the person charged;
            2.   The nature of the infraction and the ordinance provision(s)
being violated;
            3.   The location, date, and time that the infraction occurred or
was observed;
            4.   The amount of the civil penalty assessed for the infraction;
            5.   The manner, location, and time in which the civil penalty may
be paid to the county; and
            6.   The right of the recipient of the summons to elect to stand
trial for the infraction and the date for such trial.
         (c)   The summons shall provide that any person summoned for a
violation may elect to pay the civil penalty by making an appearance in person
or in writing by mail to the County Treasurer at least 72 hours prior to the
time and date fixed for trial and, by such appearance, may enter a waiver of
trial, admit liability, and pay the civil penalty established for the offense
charged. Such summons shall provide that a signature to an admission of
liability shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of court, however,
an admission shall not be deemed a criminal conviction for any purpose.

members who are residents of the county, and shall be appointed by the Circuit
Court of the county. The BZA shall serve without pay other than for usual

      (2)   Grant variances. The BZA shall authorize upon appeal and
application in specific cases such variances from the terms of §§
157.035 through
157.047 as will not be contrary to the public interest, when owing to special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions will result in unnecessary
hardship; provided, that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and
substantial justice done in accordance with the provisions of §§
157.035 through
157.047 and this section.
      (3)   Other powers. The BZA shall hear and decide all other matters
referred to and upon which it is required to pass as provided by the provisions
of §§
157.035 through
157.047 and this section.
   (C)   Duties. The BZA shall perform the following duties as are necessary to
ensure the proper, accurate, and timely disposition of all matters brought
before it.
      (1)   Institute operational procedures. The BZA shall institute
operational procedures in order to:
         (a)   Make, alter, and rescind rules and forms for its procedures,
consistent with the ordinances of this county and the general laws of the
state;
         (b)   Prescribe procedures for the conduct of public hearings that it
is required to hold; and
         (c)   Keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member
upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact. The
BZA shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of
which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Land Use Administrator
and shall become public records.
      (2)   Other. The BZA shall:
         (a)   Employ or contract for secretaries, clerks, legal counsel,
consultants, and other technical and clerical support services as deemed
necessary and within the limits of funds appropriated by the Board of
Supervisors; and
         (b)   Perform any additional activities as set forth in this
subchapter.
   (D)   Guiding principles. In fulfilling the purposes and intent of this
chapter as set forth in §§
157.001 through
157.008, the BZA in exercising the powers and duties granted and imposed by
this section, shall be guided by the following standards which shall be in
addition to any other standards imposed by this chapter:
      (1)   The use shall be in harmony with the policies embodied in the
adopted Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   The agricultural character of the county shall be preserved by
discouraging the inappropriate location of nonfarm uses in agricultural areas;
      (3)   The use shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
the applicable zoning district regulations including those associated with
properties located within a resource protection area (RPA); and
      (4)   The use shall not adversely affect the use or development of
neighboring properties and be in accordance with all applicable zoning district
regulations and any applicable provisions of the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
   (E)   Application for a variance. An application for a variance shall be
filed with and on forms furnished by the Land Use Administrator and shall
include such information as the Land Use Administrator shall require as
necessary to enforce the provisions of this section. Applications for a
variance shall be processed as described in §
157.060(B)(4).
   (F)   Findings necessary before the issuance of a variance. Variances may be
granted by the BZA only after making specific findings of fact based on the
evidence before it. These findings of fact are as follows:
      (1)   The property was acquired in good faith;
      (2)   On the effective date of this chapter, the property is:
exceptionally narrow; exceptionally shallow; exceptional size; exceptionally
shaped; or has exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary
situation or condition of the use or development of property immediately
adjacent to the subject property;
      (3)   The condition or situation of the subject property or the intended
use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make
reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted by
the Board of Supervisors as an amendment to this chapter;
      (4)   The strict application of §§
157.035 through
157.047 would produce undue hardship, and such undue hardship is not shared
generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same
vicinity;
      (5)   The strict application of §§
157.035 through
157.047 would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict all reasonable use
of the property, and the granting of a variance will alleviate a clearly
demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation as distinguished from a special
privilege or convenience sought by the applicant; and
      (6)   Authorization of the variance will not be of substantial detriment
to adjacent property; the character of the zoning district will not be changed
by the granting of the variance; and the variance will be in harmony with the
intended purposes of this chapter and in keeping with the public interest.
   (G)   Variances not authorized. No variance shall be granted that would have
the effect of:
      (1)   Increasing the density permitted in a zoning district;
      (2)   Permitting any use not specified in the zoning district in which
the property is located; or
      (3)   Altering any definition set forth in this chapter.
   (H)   Conditions attached to variances.
      (1)   Any variance granted by the BZA shall be the minimum variance
necessary to afford relief, and to this end, the BZA may permit a lesser
variance than applied for. The BZA may also prescribe such conditions or
restrictions applying to the approval of a variance as it may deem necessary in
the specific case, in order to minimize the adverse effects of such variance,
upon other property in the neighborhood. Such conditions or restrictions shall
be incorporated into the certificate of compliance and the building permit.
      (2)   The BZA may require a performance guarantee to ensure that the
conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with. Failure to
comply with such conditions or restrictions shall constitute a violation of
this chapter, and may constitute the basis for denial or revocation of a
certificate of compliance, building permit, or certificate of occupancy.
   (I)   Lapse of variance. A variance granted under the provisions of this
chapter shall automatically lapse if substantial construction, in accordance
with the plans for which such variance was granted, has not been completed
within one year from the date of granting such variance or, if judicial
proceedings to review the BZA’s decision shall be instituted, from the date of
entry of the final order in such proceedings, including all appeals.

§ 157.071  CONDITIONAL ZONING.
   (A)   Purpose. It is the general policy of the county in accordance with the
laws of the state to provide for the orderly development of land, for all
purposes through the use of zoning and other land development regulations.
Frequently where competing and incompatible uses conflict, traditional zoning
methods and procedures are inadequate. In these cases more flexible and
adaptable zoning methods are needed to permit land uses, and at the same time
to recognize the effects of change. It is the purpose of this section to
provide a more flexible and adaptable zoning method to cope with situations
found in such zones through conditional zoning, whereby a zoning
reclassification may be allowed subject to certain conditions proffered by the
zoning applicant for the protection of the community that are not applicable to
land similarly zoned. The provisions of this section are not to be used for the
purpose of discrimination in housing.
   (B)   Proffer of conditions. Any owner of property making application for a
change in zoning or an amendment to the Zoning Map, as provided by §
157.064, as part of the application may voluntarily proffer in writing
reasonable conditions which shall be in addition to the regulations provided
for in the zoning district or zone sought in the rezoning application. Any such
proffered conditions must be made prior to any public hearing before the
Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors and shall be subject to the
following limitations:
      (1)   The rezoning itself must give rise to the need of the conditions;
      (2)   The conditions shall have a reasonable relation to the rezoning;
      (3)   The conditions shall not include a cash contribution to the county;
      (4)   The conditions shall not include mandatory dedication of real or
personal property for open space, parks, schools, fire departments, or other
public facilities except for the dedication of any street, curb, gutter,
sidewalk, bicycle trail, drainage, water, or sewage systems;
      (5)   The conditions shall not include payment for or construction of
off-site improvements except for a pro rata share of water, sewage, and
drainage facilities;
      (6)   No condition shall be proffered that is not related to the physical
development or physical operation of the property; and
      (7)   All conditions shall be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan.
   (C)   Effect of conditions. Upon the approval of any such rezoning, all
conditions proffered and accepted by the Board of Supervisors shall be deemed
part thereof and non-severable therefrom and shall remain in force until
amended or varied by the Board of Supervisors in accordance with VA Code §
15.1-491.6. All such conditions shall be in addition to the regulations
provided for in the zoning district.
   (D)   Zoning Map notation and records. Each conditional rezoning shall be
designated on the Zoning Map by an appropriate symbol designed by the Land Use
Administrator. In addition, the Land Use Administrator shall keep and maintain
a conditional zoning index which shall be available for public inspection and
which shall provide ready access to the ordinance creating such conditions.
   (E)   Submittal requirements. Each application for rezoning which proposes
conditions to be applied shall be accompanied by the following items beyond
those required by conventional rezoning requests:
      (1)   A statement detailing the nature and location of any proffered
conditions and those proposed circumstances which prompted the proffering of
such conditions; and
      (2)   A signed statement by both the applicant and owner in the following
form: “I hereby proffer that the development of the subject property of this
application shall be in strict accordance with the conditions set forth in this
submission.”
   (F)   Procedural regulations and requirements.
      (1)   Proffered conditions shall include written statements, development
plans, and materials proffered in accordance with the provisions of this
section and approved by the Board of Supervisors in conjunction with the
approval of a change in zoning or an amendment to the Zoning Map.
      (2)   Upon approval, any site plan, subdivision plat, or development plan
thereafter submitted for the development of the property in question shall be
in substantial conformance with all proffered conditions and no development
shall be approved in the absence of substantial conformance. For the purpose of
this section, substantial conformance shall mean conformance which leaves a
reasonable margin for adjustment due to final engineering data but conforms
with the general nature of the development, the specific uses and the general
layout depicted by the plans, and other materials presented by the owner and/or
applicant.

§ 157.072  NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Continuation of existing uses.
      (1)   All legal activities and uses existing on the effective date of
this chapter may be continued and expanded as herein provided.
      (2)   If any change in title of possession, or renewal of a lease of any
such lot or structure occurs, the use existing may continue.
   (B)   Discontinued use. If any nonconforming use is discontinued for a
period exceeding two years after the enactment of this chapter, it shall be
deemed abandoned and any subsequent use shall conform to the requirements of
this chapter. Seafood processing facilities in operation at time of adoption of
this chapter shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
   (C)   Change of use. Whenever a nonconforming structure, lot, or activity
has been changed to a more limited nonconforming use, such new use may be
changed to only an even more limited use. Use changes (nonconforming) shall be
decided by the Land Use Administrator subject to appeal in accordance with DMP-
D as specified in §
157.060(B)(4).
   (D)   Permits. All nonconforming uses shall be identified and catalogued,
and zoning permits and certificates of compliance (for nonconforming use) shall
be issued by the Land Use Administrator within one year after adoption of this
chapter. If a nonconforming use is not documented as aforementioned, the burden
of proof for the nonconforming use shall rest with the property owner. The Land
Use Administrator may require whatever evidence as may be deemed appropriate to
substantiate the nonconforming use.
   (E)   Buildings under construction. The construction and use of a
nonconforming building for which a building permit was legally issued prior to
the adoption of this chapter may proceed, provided the building is completed
and the nonconforming use is established within one year after the effective
date of this chapter.
   (F)   Changes in district boundaries. Whenever the boundaries of a district
are changed, any uses of land or building which becomes nonconforming as a
result of such change shall become subject to the provisions of this section.
   (G)   Expansion or enlargement of existing nonconforming uses. The expansion
or enlargement of an existing nonconforming structure or activity on property
occupied on the effective date of this chapter may be permitted in accordance
with the setback, yard, and height regulations of the district within which the
use is located, with a special exception. This provision shall not apply to
signs.
   (H)   Nonconforming unimproved lots.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any
unimproved lot legally of record on the effective date of this chapter, may be
used for purposes as allowed by the zoning district in which the property is
located, provided that yard setback requirements and design standards for the
intended use can be met.
      (2)   Where any such unimproved lot can not meet the yard setback
requirements, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider applications for
variance on an individual basis.
   (I)   Damage to existing nonconforming use. If a nonconforming structure is
damaged in any manner, the structure may be repaired or replaced, provided that
there is no increase in the nonconformity.
   (J)   Nonconforming junk yards. Automobile graveyards and junkyards in
existence at the time of the adoption of this chapter are to be considered as
nonconforming uses. Within one year after the adoption of this chapter the
owner of such establishment must submit and have approved a landscape plan that
will accomplish the screening of the use from view from any public street or
from a residential use. The screening must be completed at the owners expense
and may be a uniformly painted solid fence, masonry wall, earthen berm
(stabilized), vegetation or combinations, or other means as may be approved by
the Land Use Administrator. The screening must be completed within two years
after adoption of this chapter. If vegetation is to be used, the approved plan
must be implemented and the vegetation established within one year after the
adoption of this chapter.

§ 157.073  SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. Special exception uses are those which, if not
specially regulated, can have an undue impact or be incompatible with other
uses of land within or adjacent to a given zoning district. Upon the granting
of a special exception, these uses may be allowed to locate within designated
districts under the standards, controls, limitations, performance criteria,
restrictions, and other regulations of this chapter. Special exception uses are
listed within the zoning districts in which they have the potential to be
permitted upon satisfaction of the review standards of division (B) below.
   (B)   Review standards for special exception uses. All applications for
special exceptions shall be reviewed using the following criteria.
      (1)   The proposed use shall be in harmony with the:
         (a)   Adopted Comprehensive Plan;
         (b)   Intent and purpose of the base and overlay(s) zoning district(s)
in which the use is proposed to be located;
         (c)   Character of adjacent properties and the surrounding
neighborhoods, and with existing and proposed development; and
         (d)   Design standards of this chapter.
      (2)   The proposed use shall be adequately served by essential services
such as streets, drainage facilities, fire protection, and approved water and
sewerage disposal facilities.
      (3)   The proposed use shall not result in the destruction, loss, or
damage of any feature determined to be of significant ecological, scenic, or
historic importance as determined by the resources inventory.
      (4)   The proposed use shall be designed, sited, and landscaped so that
the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development or use of
adjacent properties and surrounding areas.
   (C)   Special conditions.
      (1)   In granting any special exception, conditions necessary to assure
that the proposed use will conform with the requirements of this section and
will continue to do so may be imposed. A surety bond or other guarantee of
performance acceptable to the county may be required in order to ensure
compliance with the conditions imposed.
      (2)   Reasonable standards may be imposed as deemed necessary to protect
the public interest and welfare. Such standards may include, but need not be
limited to:
         (a)   More restrictive sign standards;
         (b)   Additional yard requirements, landscaping, or screening
requirements;
         (c)   Special lighting requirements;
         (d)   Limitation on hours of operation;
         (e)   Additional off-street parking and loading requirements; and/or
         (f)   Refinement of ingress and egress.
      (3)   Time limits or expiration dates for a special exception, including
provisions for periodic review and renewal may also become a condition of the
special exception.
   (D)   Special exception application requirements.
      (1)   An application for a special exception shall be made by the owner,
contract purchaser with the owner’s written consent, or the owner’s agent of
the property on which the proposed use is to be located. The application shall
be submitted to the Land Use Administrator, and shall be accompanied by the
filing fee. Application forms are available from the Land Use Administrator.
      (2)   If the request for a special exception has been denied by the
county, substantially the same request shall not be reconsidered within 365
days of the denial.
      (3)   The application shall include the following information:
         (a)   A plan of development in accordance with §§
157.060 through
157.079;
         (b)   A description of the proposed use and, where applicable, the
hours of operation and the proposed number of employees; and
         (c)   When deemed necessary, the Land Use Administrator or the plan-
approving authority may require a community impact analysis.
   (E)   Special exception general provisions.
      (1)   After approval of a special exception by the county, the applicant
shall have one year to begin the use approved, provided that the county may
allow, at the time of approval, a longer period than one year. If the use has
not begun within one year (or other time period as set by the county), the
special exception shall be void, and the use may not thereafter be begun except
upon approval of another special exception.
      (2)   After approval of a special exception by the county, the use
approved may intensify and/or expand, provided that any conditions attached to
the approval shall not be violated. If intensification and/or expansion will
violate any attached conditions, a new special exception shall be obtained
before such intensification and/or expansion may be approved.
      (3)   All uses permitted by a special exception shall require plan of
development approval in accordance with the provisions of §
157.061.
      (4)   If an approved special exception ceases operation for a period of
12 consecutive months, for any reason, the special exception shall become void,
and thereafter the use may only be conducted after another special exception
has been approved.
   (F)   Revocation of special exceptions. The county may by resolution
initiate a revocation of a special exception. After review by the Land Use
Administrator and consideration and recommendation by the Planning Commission,
the governing body shall act on the proposal to revoke the special exception.
Grounds for revocation shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   A change in conditions affecting the public health, safety, and
welfare since adoption of the special exception;
      (2)   Repeated violations of this chapter, including any conditions
attached to the special exception, by the owner/operator of the use;
      (3)   Fraudulent, false, or misleading information supplied by the
applicant (or his or her agent) for the special exception;
      (4)   Improper public notice of the special exception public hearing(s)
when the permit was considered in accordance with DMP-B; or
      (5)   An error or mistake in fact that led to an arbitrary and
unreasonable decision made by the plan-approving authority when approving the
special exception.

GENERAL DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
§ 157.090  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of these design and performance
standards is to ensure that new development is designed in accordance with the
purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan and county ordinances. These
standards are designed to encourage desirable development patterns and designs
that are responsive to natural and cultural resources found in the county. It
is also the intent of these standards to enable the county to provide adequate
levels of public service and to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of
individuals residing, working, shopping, traveling, and recreating within the
county.
   (B)   Plan to address standards.
      (1)   To allow for creative and flexible design, these standards are
structured so that the applicant is responsible for development of a plan
addressing the elements of this subchapter. The applicant’s plan must
demonstrate to the plan-approving authority, that the design for the particular
development is sufficient to serve the intended use in a manner which does not
create any dangerous, injurious, noxious, unsightly, or otherwise objectional
conditions.
      (2)   County staff will provide recommendations and general industry
design standards if requested by the applicant. Applicants are encouraged to
arrange a pre-application conference as specified in §
157.061(B).
(Ord. passed 11-9-1995)
§ 157.091  WATER AND SEWER FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The provisions of this section are intended to
ensure that water and sewer facilities serve any permitted use of land
associated with habitation or occupancy.
   (B)   Plan of development submittal requirements. In addition to submitting
data evidencing compliance with the requirements of this section, plan of
development submittal requirements must satisfy the requirements of state
regulatory agencies reviewing water and sewer system proposals including the
Health Department and the Department of Environmental Quality.
   (C)   General requirements.
      (1)   Water. Requirements for the provisions of potable water are as
follows.
         (a)   Public water system extension. Where public water is available,
it shall be extended to all existing and foreseeable users within the plan of
development site.
         (b)   Central water system construction.
            1.   For major plan of development proposals where public water is
not available, the developer shall construct a central water system including
distribution lines, storage tanks and facilities, and supply facilities within
the development. Upon completion of the improvements and after receiving
acceptable test results, the water system together with all necessary easements
and rights-of-way shall be dedicated to an entity acceptable to the county, or
to the county should the county elect to accept the system. No development will
be approved unless it can be fully established to the satisfaction of the
county that the central water system can be properly maintained in perpetuity.
            2.   The plan-approving authority may waive or modify the
requirement to construct a central water system upon making the following
findings, where applicable:
               a.   The minimum size of the lots is sufficiently large as to
make the installation of a central water system unnecessary;
               b.   The Health Department has approved an individual well
location on each proposed lot;
               c.   Groundwater resources will be at least equally protected by
individual wells as they would be by a central water system;
               d.   Alternative sources of water are available or will be
provided for fire suppression purposes; and
               e.   The public health is not more adequately served by a
central water system than by individual wells.
         (c)   Individual wells. Where development proposals are to be served
by individual wells, the proposed location of individual wells shall have been
approved by the Health Department.
         (d)   Existing wells. Any existing well found on property proposed for
development shall be brought into compliance with current Health Department
regulations. This shall include, but not be limited to, any open shallow well,
shallow well without proper casing top, or any flowing artesian well. Existing
wells shall be brought into compliance prior to issuance of any development
permit.
      (2)   Sewer. Requirements and standards for sewage disposal in
developments are as follows.
         (a)   Public sewer extension. If public sewer is available, it shall
be extended to all existing and foreseeable users within the development site.
         (b)   Central sewer system construction. For major plan of development
proposals located in areas in which the extension of sewer lines is not
required, and individual systems are not deemed possible or appropriate by the
plan-approving authority with supportive recommendation from the Health
Department, the developer may, or the plan-approving authority may require, the
installation of a central sewerage collection and treatment system. No plan of
development proposing a central sewerage collection and treatment system will
be approved unless it can be demonstrated that the system can be operated and
maintained efficiently and effectively in perpetuity. Approved and constructed
systems may be offered to the county, but the Board of Supervisors is under no
obligation to accept ownership and responsibility for the system.
         (c)   Individual sewer systems.
            1.   If public sewer is not available, developments proposed to be
served by septic systems may be approved by the plan-approving authority
provided:
               a.   Both a primary location and a 100% reserve location for the
septic system will be provided, neither of which shall be located, in whole or
in part, in the resource protection area. A reserve drainfield shall not be
required on any lot or parcel recorded prior to October 1, 1989, if, in the
opinion of the Health Department, the lot or parcel does not contain a site
suitable for a reserve drainfield;
               b.   The location and design for each septic system (both
primary and reserve) has been accomplished in accordance with the most current
edition of the Sewage Handling and Disposal Regulations of the State Department
of Health and has been specifically and individually approved by the Health
Department. Seasonal use septic systems or systems that are not adequate for
year round use shall not be allowed. Disposal privies and vault privies shall
not be allowed; and
               c.   Contamination or pollution of wells, groundwater, state
waters, or any Chesapeake Bay Resource Preservation Area or resource management
area is unlikely to occur from any proposed individual septic system.
            2.   Any development submitted for review shall include the
specific locations proposed for both primary and reserve on-site septic system
installations. Any proposed development lot not suitable for the installation
of private sewage disposal systems shall either be combined with lots that are
suitable or dedicated to common open space or recreation use, so that only
buildable lots are created.
         (d)   Septic tank maintenance. Any person who owns a building,
residence, or other structure which is served by an on-site sewage system not
requiring a VPDES permit shall have the system pumped out at least once every
five years. Owners of all such systems in existence within the county as of
October 1, 1989, shall submit a septic tank maintenance certificate to the Land
Use Administrator by October 1, 1996. A blank copy of this certificate is
available from the Land Use Administrator.
      (3)   Easements.
         (a)   A separate ten-foot easement for all sewer force mains,
including private force mains to remote drain fields, shall be required and
shall be located between any roadside utility easement and the lot.
         (b)   All private utility lines such as private sewer force mains, and
private water lines must be color coded and metal locator taped. All force
mains must be installed at the same time and inspected by the Health Department
prior to covering.
         (c)   All roadside easements shall be cleared and stumps removed
during the original development construction of the roads.
         (d)   No utility easement shall be permitted to have a slope greater
than two to one. Wherever cuts and fills adjacent to highway rights-of-way are
greater than two to one, the utility easement shall be located beyond the steep
slope.

157.999
§ 157.092  VEHICULAR RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of these regulations
to facilitate the development of circulation systems which permit the safe,
efficient, and orderly movement of vehicular traffic.
   (B)   Plan of development submittal requirements. All plans of development
proposing the construction of new roads or private roads and driveways which
intersect roads within the system of roads maintained by the State Department
of Transportation must submit sufficient data and plans to comply with the
submission requirements of the resident engineer as well as to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   General requirements.
      (1)   Comprehensive Plan requirements. Transportation systems shall be
designed in accordance with future densities and intensities as envisioned by
the Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   Designed for present and future needs. Road systems shall be
designed to meet but not exceed the needs of present and future populations
served, to have a simple and logical pattern which respects resources and the
natural terrain.
      (3)   Hierarchical road system. Roads shall be laid out in accordance
with a hierarchical design whereby roads are defined by function and traffic
levels.
   (D)   Street and road classifications. All new streets and roads shall be
classified according to their function and the projected average daily traffic
(ADT) count. Average daily traffic counts shall include all traffic projected
to result from the complete development of land served by the subject street,
including both internal and external trips. The trip generation rates contained
in the most recent edition of the Trip Generation Manual published by the
Institute of Transportation Engineers, shall be used to determine the projected
ADT although the plan-approving authority may accept projected generation rates
based upon documented historic local trip generation rates.
      (1)   Traffic volume classification and description. New streets shall be
classified according to the total traffic projected for the street at full
development, including full development of adjoining properties which
reasonably may be expected to produce or attract traffic which will utilize the
street. This is depicted below.
Traffic Volume-Based Street Classifications
Classification Minimum ADT Maximum ADT
Traffic Volume-Based Street Classifications
Classification  Minimum ADT Maximum ADT
Access          -           250
Major arterial  -           Over 8,000
Major collector 1,001       4,000
Minor arterial  4,001       8,000
Minor collector 401         1,000
Subcollector    251         400
 
      (2)   Design categories.
         (a)   Access street. Carry only the volume of traffic generated on the
street itself.
         (b)   Subcollector street. May carry the volume of at least one access
street in addition to its own volume.
         (c)   Collector street. Unsuitable for providing direct residential
lot access, however, occasionally no suitable alternative exists.
         (d)   Arterial street. Direct residential lot access is prohibited and
commercial or industrial lot access is controlled and limited.
      (3)   Existing streets. Where existing streets which are not otherwise
classified by the Comprehensive Plan abut or affect the design of a proposed
development, such existing streets shall be classified in accordance with the
functional and traffic volume descriptions contained in this section.
   (E)   Alignment and layout.
      (1)   Coordination of proposed road with existing roads. In accordance
with VA Code § 15.1-466(c), all proposed streets shall be designed to
coordinate with other existing or planned streets contiguous to or within the
general area of the proposed development or within existing or future adjacent
developments as to location, width, grades, and drainage. Connections, when
required, with existing or platted streets, shall be continuous without offset.
      (2)   Stub streets. The plan-approving authority may require that
adequate rights-of-way are platted to the boundary line(s) of any development
in order to afford desirable street access to adjoining properties and to
facilitate the development of an effective and efficient circulation system.
      (3)   Conditions whereby stub streets are permanently terminated. Where a
street right-of-way in an existing development has been platted to the boundary
line of a proposed development, it shall be extended and continued into an
adjacent proposed development unless exempted from this requirement by the
plan-approving authority upon the recommendation of the Department of
Transportation or upon the plan-approving authority making one of the following
findings.
         (a)   Such an extension would cause or contribute to a demonstrable
safety deficiency which could not be corrected in a practical or economically
efficient manner. In such cases, the developer shall be responsible for
providing sufficient right-of-way and constructing a permanent circular or “T”
turnaround in accordance with the standards of the Department of
Transportation.
         (b)   The street right-of-way in the existing development, although
platted, has not had a street constructed within it, is not contained within
the Comprehensive Plan, and it is unlikely that, in the foreseeable future,
such a street will be constructed. In such case, the developer shall not be
responsible for providing a turnaround.
      (4)   Intersection geometries. Streets shall intersect at a 90-degree
angle plus or minus five degrees for a minimum of 50 feet from the
intersection. No intersection shall have more than four street approaches.
   (F)   Rights-of-way.
      (1)   Dedication. Where a development abuts an existing public right-of-
way which has a width deficiency created either because it is less than 50 feet
in width or because adopted plans show that a greater width will be necessary
to accommodate those plans, the developer shall be required to dedicate
additional rights-of-way as follows:
         (a)   Where the development abuts one side of the right-of-way, the
developer shall dedicate one-half of the right-of-way deficiency along the
frontage of the development; and
         (b)   Where the development abuts both sides of the right-of-way, the
developer shall dedicate all of the right-of-way deficiency along the frontages
of the development.
      (2)   Minimum right-of-way widths. The minimum right-of-way width shall
be in accordance with the State Department of Transportation standards. For
private roads, the plan-approving authority may approve right-of-way widths
based upon the anticipated function and traffic load of the street.
   (G)   Geometric standards.
      (1)   Continuity of design. All streets shall have a continuity of design
throughout their entire length. Multiple or step-down designs shall not be
permitted except that a transition may be permitted at a four-way intersection
or other major traffic generator which would constitute a clear demarcation of
said change.
      (2)   Right-of-way widths. Right-of-way widths shall conform with the
State Department of Transportation standards unless otherwise approved by the
county for private roads.
   (H)   Construction standards.
      (1)   Compliance with Department of Transportation standards. Unless
otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, all streets shall be in
conformance with Department of Transportation requirements.
      (2)   Base and pavement. Base and pavement design shall be based on the
load-bearing capacities of soils located within proposed street rights-of-way
as detailed in a subsurface soils report, certified by a geotechnical engineer.
The plan-approving authority may, however, upon the recommendation of the
Department of Transportation, waive or modify this requirement when there is
sufficient cause to believe that such a report is unnecessary.
      (3)   Plans require Department of Transportation approval. Street
construction plans shall be submitted to and approved by both the Department of
Transportation and the county as a part of the review process required by this
chapter.
      (4)   Construction guarantees. Street construction guarantees shall not
be fully released until street(s) have been accepted into the State Secondary
System.
   (I)   Curb and gutter streets. Curb and gutter streets shall be provided
when required by the plan-approving authority or the State Department of
Transportation.
   (J)   Cul-de-sac streets.
      (1)   Length of cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 1,500
feet in length, or serve more than 35 dwellings whichever is the less
restrictive. The length shall be measured from the end of the cul-de-sac to the
closest intersection which provides a means of egress from the development,
either directly or indirectly. Where the plan-approving authority determines
that the topography, property configuration, or other physical constraints are
such that a cul-de-sac of greater length is required or desirable for the
effective and efficient development of the property, the plan-approving
authority may authorize cul-de-sacs which exceed 1,500 feet in length.
      (2)   Dead end street signs. A sign shall be posted at the entrance to
any cul-de-sac indicating it is a dead end street if the end of the cul-de-sac
is not clearly visible from the entrance.
      (3)   Cul-de-sac turnaround design. Cul-de-sac streets shall be
terminated by a turnaround having a minimum right-of-way radius of 50 feet and
a minimum pavement radius of 35 feet.
   (K)   Service alleys. In certain situations, the use of service alleys may
be a desirable alternative to the more traditional type of development. When
alleys are proposed, the following conditions shall apply.
      (1)   Frontage. Frontage on an alley shall not be construed to satisfy
any lot frontage requirements of §§
157.035 through
157.047.
      (2)   Maintenance of alleys. Service alleys shall only be created if they
are proposed to be maintained by a property owners’ association with the
capacity to maintain the service alleys. Notations to this effect shall be
clearly indicated on the approved plan and other applicable documents recorded
in the courthouse.
      (3)   Alley design. Service alleys shall have a minimum right-of-way
width of 14 feet, a minimum pavement width of ten feet, and a maximum
uninterrupted length of 500 feet.
      (4)   Alleys not to be designed to handle through traffic. Transportation
system design shall be such that alleys are not used by vehicular through
traffic desiring to bypass roads more suitable for their passage.
      (5)   Dead end alleys. Where alleys are proposed to terminate in a cul-
de-sac, either a circular or a “T” turnaround shall be provided.
   (L)   Regulatory and traffic signs.
      (1)   Developer responsible for providing signs. The developer shall be
responsible for the provision of all regulatory and traffic signs required to
maintain and ensure traffic safety during and after construction of
improvements. This shall include the provision of temporary or permanent
regulatory and traffic signs during construction, if required by the plan-
approving authority after consultation with the Department of Transportation.
      (2)   Signs erected prior to the issuance of building permits. All
intersections of development streets with existing public roadways shall be
provided with appropriate stop or yield signs, as determined by the Department
of Transportation, prior to the issuance of any building permits for any
structure on a lot contained within said development accessed directly or
indirectly through such intersection.
      (3)   Signs erected prior to building occupancy. All required regulatory
and traffic signs within any development shall be installed prior to occupancy
of any structure within the development.
   (M)   Sight triangles.
      (1)   Sight triangle area defined. A SIGHT TRIANGLE AREA is a triangular-
shaped portion of land established at street intersections and entrances onto
streets in which nothing is permitted to be erected, placed, planted, or
allowed to grow in a manner that limits or obstructs the sight distance of
motorists, bicyclists, or pedestrians traversing or using the intersection or
entrance. The protected sight distance area is the triangle with legs that are
the intersecting flow lines of two streets or an entrance/exit and a street at
an intersection.
      (2)   Sight triangle area requirements. Where local streets meet (or
entrance/exit with a local street), the legs of the triangle shall extend 35
feet away from the intersection of the flow lines. Where the intersection is
with a collector or arterial street, the legs of the triangle shall be 45 feet
from the intersection or the flow lines.
      (3)   Sight triangle area clearance. Signs, plantings, structures, and
other obstructions which would obscure or impede sight lines between three feet
and seven feet in height above grade shall be prohibited within the sight
triangle area.
      (4)   Sight triangle area indicated on the plan of development. The sight
triangle shall be clearly shown and its purposes noted on the final approved
plan of development.
   (N)   Private roads. Developments which contain private roads as permitted
must, at a minimum, meet each of the requirements set forth under either Type I
or Type II below.
      (1)   Type I. Type I private roads must meet or exceed each of the
following requirements.
         (a)   The private roads must connect directly to a state-maintained,
hard-surfaced road at one location and not connect to any other road. All roads
in the proposed development shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with the most current edition of State Department of Transportation subdivision
street requirements, as well as other applicable regulations of the Department
of Transportation, except that the road need not be hard surfaced.
         (b)   No more than 24 lots shall be within the development.
         (c)   1.   Prior to the sale of any lots, the developer shall erect,
within 25 feet of the point where the primary access road to the development
joins a state-maintained road, a permanent sign, clearly visible from the state
maintained road, containing the following statement in block letters no less
than three inches high: “THE UNPAVED ROADS IN THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL NOT BE
PAVED OR MAINTAINED AT PUBLIC EXPENSE.”
            2.   Such sign shall be maintained by the developer and the
organization established pursuant to division (N)(1)(h), in clearly visible
condition, so long as the developer owns any lot in the development.
         (d)   Each private road shall be clearly marked as such on the final
plat and other applicable documents of any development recorded in the
courthouse. The developer shall have boldly printed upon the final plat, the
real estate sales/land contract, and as a covenant in each deed for a lot in
the development, the following statements:
 
“THE PRIVATE ROADS IN THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL NOT BE PAVED OR MAINTAINED WITH FUNDS
FROM RICHMOND COUNTY OR FUNDS ADMINISTERED BY THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION. IN ADDITION, RICHMOND COUNTY SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION POLICIES WILL
NOT ALLOW SCHOOL BUSES TO TRAVEL AND PICK UP CHILDREN ON PRIVATE ROADS. IN THE
EVENT THAT OWNERS OF LOTS IN THIS DEVELOPMENT SUBSEQUENTLY DESIRE THE ADDITION OF
SUCH PRIVATE ROADS TO THE SECONDARY SYSTEM OF STATE HIGHWAYS FOR MAINTENANCE, THE
COST TO UPGRADE IT TO PRESCRIBED STANDARDS MUST BE PROVIDED FROM FUNDS OTHER THAN
THOSE ADMINISTERED BY THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OR RICHMOND COUNTY.
PRIVATE ROADS IN THIS DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT DEDICATED AND ARE OWNED BY (trust,
corporation, property owners’ association).”
 
         (e)   Except where required by the plan-approving authority to serve a
specified public purpose, such private road shall not be designed to serve
through traffic nor to intersect the state highway system in more than one
location.
         (f)   Any private road shall be adequate to carry the traffic volume
which may be reasonably expected to be generated by the subdivision.
         (g)   The fee simple ownership of private road is to be owned by a
private membership corporation, property owners’ association, or a trust

         (i)   The initial funding of the Road Maintenance Fund of the trust,
corporation, or association shall be provided by the developer depositing to
the credit of such trust, corporation, or association 5% of the gross sales
price for each lot sold in the development or a minimum of $500 per lot,
whichever is greater. This percentage of the gross sales price shall be paid
upon closing of each and every lot in the development. Gross sales price as
used herein shall mean the selling price to a bona fide third-party purchase,
and in the event of a sale which is not at arm’s-length, the gross selling
price shall be deemed to be the actual market value of the lot as determined by
the trustees, corporation, or association to be established, or the assessed
value of the lot for real estate tax purposes, whichever is less.
      (2)   Type II. Type II private roads must meet or exceed each of the
following requirements.
         (a)   The private road must connect directly to a state-maintained,
hard-surfaced road at one location and not connect to any other road.
         (b)   The applicable design and construction standards shall be
provided by the developer and must demonstrate to the plan-approving authority
the adequacy of the design and construction standards. The plan-approving
authority may consult with the Department of Transportation for suggestions on
the design. If a design is used that does not meet Department of Transportation
standards with regard to alignment, sight distances, and right-of-way widths,
the private road shall be precluded from being brought into the state system of
secondary highways. Any requests, by the developer or subsequent owners of lots
within the development, for acceptance of the private road into the state
system shall be not be considered until the road is constructed by the
developer or lot owners to all current State Department of Transportation
standards, including hard surfacing.
         (c)   Each private road shall be clearly marked as such on the final

§ 157.096  DRAINAGE.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of these regulations
to ensure that developments shall be provided with such storm drains, culverts,
drainageways, or other works as are necessary to collect and dispose of surface
and stormwater originating on or flowing across the development, in order to
prevent inundation and damage to streets, lots, and buildings, and to improve
the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.
   (B)   Plan of development submittal requirements.
      (1)   Compliance with requirements of this section. Plan of development
proposals shall include the submission of sufficient evidence in the form of
plans and attachments which establish that the plan complies with the
requirements of this section.
      (2)   Stormwater management plan. The preliminary submission of a plan of
development shall be accompanied by a stormwater management plan, if and as
required by the Land Use Administrator, showing sufficient information to
enable a determination to be made relative to the improvements necessary for
controlling stormwater runoff, including drainage plans and flood control
devices. This plan shall show natural drainage patterns and any proposal
drainage improvements, including pipe sizes and types, stormwater detention and
retention facilities, drainage easements and any other means for transporting
drainage waters to a well-defined open stream. Areas subject to periodic
flooding (100-year flood) shall be delineated on preliminary and final plans of
development.
      (3)   Continuing management plan. A continuing management plan, including
a property owners’ association or other appropriate maintenance entity as if
necessary, shall be submitted for all elements of the drainage and flood
control system which will not be the explicit maintenance responsibility of the
county or the State Department of Transportation. The developer shall provide
assurance that all facilities are in good repair and properly functioning when
the development has been completed and prior to the responsibility for
continuing maintenance and ownership of drainage systems being conveyed to the
designated maintenance entity.
   (C)   General requirements.
      (1)   Provision of drainage and stormwater management facilities.
         (a)   Drainage and stormwater management facilities shall be provided,
either on-site or off-site, to reduce drainage flows, pollutants, and sediment
loading from the development to a level not exceeding the conditions prior to
development, or to a lesser level, if deemed necessary to comply with the
provisions governing pollutant and sediment discharges associated with §
157.047.
         (b)   The plan-approving authority shall approve, or approve with
modifications, only those stormwater management facilities which comply with
the intent of this chapter or with adopted overall drainage plans and policies,
if any. In this regard, the plan-approving authority shall not generally
approve, except as a temporary measure, on-site stormwater management
facilities as an alternative to contributing to planned regional stormwater
management systems, if and when such a management system is in effect.
         (c)   All management facilities shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with §
157.097 as supplemented by the latest editions of the Virginia Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook and the Department of Transportation Drainage Manual
as well as regulations, or policies adopted by the state or the county pursuant
to §
157.047.
      (2)   Drainage easements. Where a development is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a
drainage easement of sufficient area and width to protect and preserve the
aforementioned feature. Drainage easements shall be designed and drainage
structures constructed in such a manner as to reduce the burden of maintenance,
yet provide adequate access for necessary maintenance.
      (3)   Drainage of rights-of-way. All public rights-of-way shall be
drained in accordance with the requirements of the State Department of
Transportation.
      (4)   Appropriate grading considerations.
         (a)   No stormwater runoff or drainage water shall be so diverted as
to overload existing drainage systems or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on other private properties or public lands
without proper and approved provisions being made for taking care of these
conditions.
         (b)   Lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage away from
buildings and prevent the ponding of stormwater unless within an approved
retention or detention basin and/or in a manner as intended by §
157.047.
         (c)   No grading shall occur within 100 feet of any perennial
watercourse or wetland except as provided for specific waterfront erosion
control, or water-dependent facilities or for necessary utilities and public
street construction.
      (5)   Maintenance of existing drainage patterns. In general, the design
of a development shall be such as to minimize grading and disturbance of
natural vegetation. Natural contours and stormwater channels shall be respected
and retained where possible.
      (6)   Minimize impervious surface areas.
         (a)   A stormwater management plan shall preserve natural drainageways
and wetlands, maximize infiltration of stormwater and minimize off-site
discharge of stormwater.
         (b)   In general, impervious surfaces near waterfronts and wetlands
shall be avoided; grass swales shall be utilized and curb and gutter and paved
ditches shall be avoided except where necessary to prevent erosion in
accordance with the standards of the State Department of Transportation.
   (D)   Stormwater management area design considerations. Stormwater
management areas include retention and detention basins, drainage ditches and
swales, and wetlands areas. Sensitively designed basins and swales can benefit
the health, safety, and welfare of county residents. The integration of these
areas as desirable landscape features, naturalized wetland areas, or active and
passive recreation areas, in addition to their stormwater management function
is strongly encouraged whenever possible.
      (1)   Stormwater detention areas.
         (a)   One of the following landscape concepts for stormwater detention
areas, or an alternative concept complying with the general statement set forth
above, shall be used.
         (b)   Reforestation: this landscape treatment is most appropriate for
detention basins and drainage areas that are adjacent to areas of mature
woodlands or wetlands. It reverts the disturbed area to a revegetated, stable,
low maintenance, natural landscape asset over time.
            1.   The area shall be graded to blend into the surrounding
landscape and imitate a natural depression with an irregular edge. This shall
include gentle berming. Linear, geometric basins are unacceptable.
            2.   The quantity of trees to be planted on the interior of the
basins shall be equal to the number of trees that would be necessary to provide
canopy cover of the entire area to the high water line or outflow elevation.
Plantings shall not be located within 20 feet of low-flow channels to allow for
channel maintenance. All woody and herbaceous plants shall be species
indigenous to the area and/or tolerant to typical wet/dry floodplain
conditions.
            3.   The perimeter area (slopes above the high water line) shall
include shade trees, evergreen trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, and groundcover
that results in screening that is as maintenance free as possible.
            4.   Provisions for emergency access as well as general maintenance
of the basins shall be provided. Plantings shall be designed to disguise yet
not hinder vehicular access.
            5.   Tree plantings are not permitted upon any dikes associated
with a detention basin.
      (2)   Stormwater retention areas; open space/recreation features. This
landscape treatment can take on a variety of landscape forms, from formal
reflecting pools, fountain features to natural park-like lakes and ravines.
         (a)   Water fountains/features are encouraged in the design of
developments.
         (b)   The waters edge shall be easily maintained and stable. Possible
treatments might include riprap, stone walls, natural plantings, decking, and
bulkheads.
         (c)   The planting of the perimeter of the feature shall integrate
pedestrian paths, sitting areas, and other passive uses.
         (d)   Plants with pervasive root systems shall not be located where
they may cause damage to drainage pipes or other underground utilities.
         (e)   All engineered basin structures shall be designed to blend into
the landscape in terms of construction materials, color, grading, and planting.
   (E)   Stream and lake sampling.
      (1)   Predevelopment sampling.
         (a)   All major plans of development abutting lakes and streams shall
submit, at the time application is made, water sample results with test and
sample for:
            1.   Temperature;
            2.   Nitrogen, total kjeldahl;
            3.   Dissolved oxygen;
            4.   Chloride;
            5.   pH;
            6.   Phosphorous;
            7.   Alkalinity; and
            8.   Fecal coliform.
         (b)   These tests shall undertaken at the time of major preliminary
plan of development submission and the date of the test shall be so noted.
         (c)   Samples shall be taken and tested in accordance with generally
accepted procedures by or under the jurisdiction of a qualified testing
laboratory.
         (d)   Tests shall be taken at the intersection of any tract boundary
and the inflowing streams, and at the outfall points where the watercourse
leaves the tract.
      (2)   Post-development sampling. If the major plan of development is
approved and constructed, a second set of tests shall be taken by the developer
at the discretion of and at a time decided by the Land Use Administrator, but
not after performance and maintenance guarantees have been released. All
results and comparisons shall be given to the Land Use Administrator for review
and analysis. Performance and maintenance guarantees may be applied to correct
any degraded water-quality conditions, which in the opinion of the Land Use
Administrator, are as a result of the implementation and construction of the
plan of development.
   (F)   Off-site drainage costs.
      (1)   Applicability. The developer shall be required to pay a pro rata
share of the cost of providing reasonable and necessary drainage improvements
located outside of the property limits of land owned or controlled by him or
her whenever all of the following conditions exist:
         (a)   The plan-approving authority determines that such off-site
improvements are necessitated at least in part by the construction or
improvement of the development;
         (b)   The county has established a general drainage improvement
program for an area having related and common drainage conditions. The
developer’s property is located within the designated area covered by this
program;
         (c)   The estimated cost of the total drainage improvement program has
been determined; and
         (d)   The estimated stormwater runoff has been established for the
designated area served by such program.
      (2)   Cost determination. The developer’s share of the estimated cost of
improvements shall be limited to the proportion of such estimated cost which
the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff to be caused by his or her
development bears to the total estimated volume and velocity of runoff from
such area in its fully developed state.
      (3)   Payment provisions. Any cash payment received by the county shall
be expended only for construction of those facilities identified in the
established drainage facilities improvement program and until so expended,
shall be held in a separate account for the individual improvement program.

         (k)   Emergency work and repairs to protect life, limb, or property,
however, if the land-disturbing activity would have required an approved
erosion and sediment control plan, or the activity were not an emergency, then
the land area disturbed shall be shaped and stabilized in accordance with the
requirements of the Land Use Administrator.
      (3)   Criteria, standards, and specifications for the preparation of an
erosion and sediment control plan. Persons submitting plans in accordance with
this section shall be governed by the criteria, standards and specifications
established in Chapter 6 of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
In the case of a land-disturbing activity for the construction of a single-
family dwelling, the Land Use Administrator may waive the requirement for a
full erosion and sediment control plan as set forth in this chapter. When an
agreement in lieu of an erosion and sediment control plan is signed by the
applicant and approved by the Land Use Administrator. This agreement shall
constitute authorization under this chapter to conduct land-disturbing activity
allowed by the agreement. Such agreement shall set forth all conservation
measures to be carried out and maintained, shall grant right-of-entry to the
Land Use Administrator and his or her designees in order to make the project
subject to all review, inspection, and enforcement provisions of this chapter
as well as to facilitate the installation or maintenance of erosion and
sediment control measures in the event the applicant fails to comply with the
approved plan.
      (4)   Plan review.
         (a)   The Land Use Administrator has been designated as the plan-
approving authority for the county. The Northern Neck Soil and Water
Conservation District may be called on to conduct a nonbinding review of any
plan. In reviewing plans, the Land Use Administrator may also seek or receive
recommendations or comments from the State Department of Transportation, the
Health Department and such other agencies that are deemed to have some
responsibility in this area.
         (b)   The Land Use Administrator shall, within 45 days, approve any
erosion and sediment control plan submitted to him or her if he or she
determines that the plan meets the conservation standards of the local control
program and if the person responsible for carrying out the plan certifies that
he or she will properly perform the erosion and sediment control measures
included in the plan and will comply with the provisions of this chapter.
         (c)   When a plan is determined to be inadequate, the Land Use
Administrator, within 45 days of receipt, shall give written notice of
disapproval stating the specific reasons for his or her disapproval. The Land
Use Administrator shall specify such modifications, terms, and conditions as
will permit approval of the plan and shall communicate these requirements to
the applicant. If no action is taken by the Land Use Administrator within the
time specified above, the plan shall be deemed approved and the person shall be
authorized to proceed with the proposed activity.
         (d)   An approved plan may be changed by the Land Use Administrator in
the following cases:
            1.   Where inspection has revealed the inadequacy of the plan to
accomplish the erosion and sediment control objectives of this chapter, plan
changes can be required without approval of the person responsible for carrying
out the plan in order to comply with the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook, which is assumed to be an integral part of every plan; or
            2.   Where the person responsible for carrying out the approved
plan finds that because of changed circumstances or for other reasons, the
approved plan cannot be effectively carried out, and the proposed amendments to
the plan, consistent with the requirements of this chapter, are agreed to by
the Land Use Administrator and the person responsible for carrying out the
plan.
      (5)   Issuance of grading, building, or other permits.
         (a)   The Building Official or any other agency authorized under any
other law to issue building or other permits for land-disturbing activities

disturbing activities involve lands under the jurisdiction of the county and
one or more other localities may, at the option of the applicant, be submitted
to the State Division of Soil and Water Conservation for review and approval,
rather than submission to each jurisdiction concerned. However, if the
applicant chooses to submit his or her plans to the State Division of Soil and
Water Conservation rather than the local jurisdiction, he or she shall notify,
by certified mail, the Land Use Administrator of his or her intention at the
same time of submittal.)
            4.   A performance bond has been submitted to and accepted by the
county (single-family dwellings constructed with an approved plan are exempt
from this requirement).
         (b)   When the Land Use Administrator does not have documentation in
hand that the person responsible for carrying out the plan has certified that
he or she will properly perform the control measures included in the plan, the

         (a)   Generally. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces
proposed with proper access from a public right-of-way or driveway shall be
included in the plan of development for all uses. The plan-approving authority
shall be guided by the number of persons to be employed in said building or by
the use; the number of persons expected to reside in, visit, or patronize the
building or use, and the need for safe and convenient loading space for
visitors, patrons, and goods.
         (b)   Shared parking. The required parking space for any number of
separate uses may be combined in one facility. The number of spaces required in
such a shared facility shall be determined by the plan-approving authority
after review of a parking study submitted by the applicant.
      (2)   Size of spaces. Parking spaces shall be sized in accordance with
generally accepted standards.
      (3)   Design of parking spaces for the physically handicapped. Parking
spaces for the physically handicapped shall be designed in accordance with the

      (2)   The dimensions of driveways shall be designed to adequately
accommodate the volume and character of vehicles anticipated to be attracted
daily.
   (E)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   Location and design. In addition to all required parking spaces and
driveways, pedestrian sidewalks shall be provided in off-street parking areas
for pedestrian safety. Sidewalks shall be protected from vehicular encroachment
by wheel stops, curbs, or other methods approved by the plan-approving
authority. Sidewalks shall be a minimum width of four feet. Parked vehicles
shall not overhang or extend over sidewalk areas, unless an additional sidewalk
width of three feet is provided to accommodate such overhang.
      (2)   Separation of sidewalk areas from parking spaces. All parking
spaces shall be separated from sidewalks, roads, and landscaped areas by wheel
stops, curbs, or other method approved by the plan-approving authority.
   (F)   Off-street loading; applicability. Whenever the normal operation of
any development requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely
delivered to or shipped from that development, sufficient off-street loading

§ 157.101  LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The regulations established herein are intended to
maintain the vegetated environment of the county, thereby preserving the
county’s rural qualities and incorporating vegetation in the form of
landscaping and buffering within plans of development.
   (B)   Plan of development submittal requirements. Every plan of development
shall include a landscape plan. This plan shall include the following.
      (1)   Existing vegetation. Location and identification by size and name
all mature or significant trees in open areas on the site. In wooded areas the
average size, and predominant species of trees shall be shown.
      (2)   Buffering details. Location, dimensions, and area of all proposed
buffer areas including areas proposed to be fenced, walled, or screened through
the use of architectural or any other landscape method.
      (3)   Landscaping details. Location, size, type, and name of all new
landscaping materials, as well as materials to be retained on site.
      (4)   Vegetation protection. Details and notes pertaining to the methods
to be utilized to protect trees and plant materials to remain on site from
damage, both during and after development of the site.
      (5)   Maintenance notations. Appropriate notations regarding
responsibility for the perpetuation and maintenance of all landscape plant
materials or other landscape features to be preserved or installed on the site.
      (6)   Waiver of submittal requirements. The plan-approving authority may
waive all or a part of the submittal requirements if an application can be
thoroughly and responsibly evaluated despite the absence of waived submittal
data.
   (C)   General requirements.
      (1)   Maximize the value of vegetated material. Trees, shrubs, ground
cover, and other landscaping shall be located so as to utilize effectively the
natural capacities of plant materials to intercept and absorb airborne and
runoff-related pollutants and to reduce runoff volume, velocity, and peak flow
increases caused by development.
      (2)   Existing trees to be preserved. Existing viable and mature trees
shall be preserved and protected as a part of the overall landscaping plan.
      (3)   Landscaping to suit the site. Landscape materials and designs shall
be appropriate for the specific characteristics of the site.
      (4)   Landscaping to buffer development impacts. Landscaping of buffer
areas shall be designed to reduce, as much as possible, the impacts of
development on adjacent natural areas, the scenic rural character of the
county, and on adjacent landowners who might be adversely impacted by the
proposed development.
      (5)   Preserve existing natural buffers. In all cases, the preservation
of natural buffers is encouraged.
      (6)   Design of buffers. Plant material screens and structural elements
used as buffers shall be designed in a staggered or undulating manner to create
a more natural looking buffer.
      (7)   Landscaping areas devoid of trees. All land development areas
devoid of major trees, including the areas along the roads of the development
where natural woods are not present, and where due to construction, the entire
right-of-way is cleared, the following provisions shall apply.
         (a)   Trees shall be planted along both sides of all streets as
approved by the plan-approving authority.
         (b)   Trees shall be planted at 40- to 50-foot intervals.
      (8)   Buffering objectionable site features. Objectionable features
including dumpsters, outside storage areas, and large parking areas (ten
vehicles or greater) as well as loading areas shall be visually buffered by
landscaping and structural elements.
   (D)   Landscape preservation. The preservation of existing vegetation on a
development site has distinct advantages since this vegetation is well
established and tolerant of existing conditions, and can be readily employed to
fulfill the intent and purpose of this section. Incorporating natural features
into plan of development proposals not only improves the quality of the
project, but also reduces construction problems and increases the value of the
development. Soil erosion and sedimentation control costs are reduced. The
existing vegetation holds soil in place and breaks the impact of falling rain.
Forest soils are porous and function like a sponge soaking up stormwater. The
value of homes is increased when trees are retained and the resultant
appearance is one of an established community. The following provisions are
intended to facilitate the preservation and beneficial use of existing
vegetation during development.
      (1)   Construction footprint. The construction footprint shall not exceed
60% of the site.
      (2)   Which trees shall be preserved. In determining which trees and
shrubs shall be preserved during the development process, consideration shall
be given to preserving those which exhibit some or all of the following
characteristics:
         (a)   Are significant trees;
         (b)   Can tolerate environmental changes caused by development;
         (c)   Are disease and insect resistant;
         (d)   Exist in natural groupings including islands of trees; and
         (e)   Do not conflict with necessary utility, structure, parking area,
and roadway placements.
      (3)   Protecting trees during construction. Trees which are to be
preserved on-site shall be protected before, during, and after the development
process utilizing accepted practices. At a minimum, the most recent edition of
the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook shall be utilized.
      (4)   Protecting woodland groups. In woodland areas, groups of trees
shall be selected for preservation rather than single trees wherever possible.
      (5)   Tree clearing limits marked and approved.
         (a)   The Land Use Administrator shall approve the marked limits of
clearing in the field prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities
to ensure that the limits of clearing as marked conform to the plans approved
as part of the plan of development approval process.
         (b)   Trees to be saved shall be marked by red ribbon.
         (c)   Trees to be removed shall be marked by blue ribbon.
         (d)   In heavily wooded areas, the Land Use Administrator may give
permission to mark large groups of trees to be removed or saved with
appropriately colored ribbon along the perimeter of the area.
      (6)   Areas of development sites to remain undisturbed. Natural
vegetation existing on slopes of 25% or greater, in wetlands, within 100 feet
of a perennial watercourse or wetland, or any other feature of a resource
protection area shall be left undisturbed as a buffer area during development,
provided however that:
         (a)   Access paths and view corridors or sight lines may be cleared
along waterways, lakes, or wetlands. In general, trees larger than ten inches
d.b.h. shall not be removed; and
         (b)   Where natural vegetation is removed, it shall be replaced with
other vegetation equally effective in retarding erosion and preserving natural
appearance.
   (E)   Site landscaping standards. The following standards apply to all
development except single-family dwellings built on individual lots.
      (1)   Landscape areas adjacent to buildings. A landscape area which is a
minimum of ten-feet wide shall be provided adjacent to buildings. This area
shall contain a number of trees and shrubs equal to at least one ornamental
tree or five shrubs per 200 square feet of planting area provided.
      (2)   Landscape areas along rights-of-way.
         (a)   The landscape area along rights-of-way shall be designed to
maintain continuous natural corridors along existing and proposed rights-of-
way. This landscaped area shall be a minimum of 30 feet in depth from the edge
of the right-of-way to off-street parking areas.
         (b)   The 30-foot buffer area between the right-of-way and an on-site
parking area may be selectively thinned if fully wooded or shall be planted
with shade trees 40 to 50 feet apart along the right-of-way if void of
vegetation.
      (3)   Landscape areas within parking lots. Five percent of the interior
of any parking, loading, or other vehicular use area shall be landscaped. The
location of such landscaping is at the option of the developer; provided,
however, the following standards shall apply.
         (a)   Shade trees within parking areas shall be provided at a minimum
rate of one tree per ten parking spaces. Shrubs shall be planted at a rate of
two shrubs per ten parking spaces.
         (b)   No more than ten parking spaces shall be permitted in a
continuous row without being interrupted by a landscaped island of not less
than six feet in width. Such landscape island shall be planted with one shade
tree.
         (c)   Each parking row shall terminate in a landscape island of not
less than ten feet in width. Such landscaped island shall be planted with one
shade tree.
         (d)   Parked vehicles may overhang a landscaped median strip no more
than three feet, provided curbing or other wheel stops are installed to ensure
no greater overhang or penetration of the median strip.
         (e)   Landscaped islands and median strips shall be planted in grass
or any year-round ground cover and/or mulched.
      (4)   Exemption from division (E)(3) above. The provisions of division
(E)(3) above shall not be applicable in the following situations:
         (a)   Where any off-street parking, loading, or other vehicular use
area will be entirely screened from the public view and from abutting property
by a building or structure; or
         (b)   Where the total parking area contains less than ten parking
spaces.
   (F)   Buffer areas.
      (1)   Function. The function of buffer areas is to provide visual and
noise barriers between adjacent land uses, or between a land use and a public
road which block out both visual nuisances, such as glare from lights, and
shield the source of noise from view, thereby reducing its perceived impacts.
Additionally, buffers may serve as a protective or safety barrier, by blocking
physical passage. The provision of buffer areas enables land uses of varying
intensities to be approximate to each other, thereby accommodating the needs
and values of both the developer and adjacent landowners.
      (2)   Buffer design. The design of buffer areas shall utilize distance,
vegetative material, and structural elements such as fences, privacy walls,
berms, or other approved elements. One or more of these features shall be
required depending on adjacent existing or proposed uses.
   (G)   Standards relating to plant materials selected for installation.
      (1)   Plant selection. Plants selected for use must be shown to be
tolerant to the climatic conditions of the county. It is recommended that
predominately indigenous plant species be used which would enable newly
installed plants to blend in with natural vegetated conditions. Foliage type,
light conditions, rate of growth, ultimate size, and primary uses shall also be
considered when selecting plant species.
      (2)   Size standards. All landscaping required within this section shall
conform with the following minimum size standards.
Minimum Plant Size at Planting
Plant Material Type Minimum Size Minimum Branch Spread

      (3)   Quality standards. All plant materials installed on a site shall be
of high quality and in excellent condition at planting. The Land Use
Administrator may withhold the release of required guarantees until plants
which are deemed to be undersized, inappropriate, in poor condition, or
improperly planted are satisfactorily replaced or repositioned.
   (H)   Maintenance of landscaping and buffering. The property owner, or his
or her successors, shall be responsible for the perpetuation and maintenance of
all landscaping, fencing, and buffering materials required by this chapter as
shown on an approved landscape plan. Failure to maintain such landscaping,
fencing, and buffering shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
      (1)   Vegetation maintenance. All plant material required by this chapter
or as shown on the plan shall be tended and maintained in a healthy growing
condition, replaced when necessary, and kept free of refuse, litter, and
debris.
      (2)   Buffer maintenance. All fences, walls, and buffering required by
this chapter or shown on the plan shall be maintained in good repair and kept
free of refuse, litter, and debris.
      (3)   Replacement vegetation to conform to approved plan. All landscaping
material shown on the plan which may subsequently be replaced on the site shall
conform with the original approved landscape plan with respect to size and
characteristics of the plantings. In meeting the terms of this section, the
replacement of mature trees on site shall require the installation of trees of
a similar species.

preserves, buffer areas, and ancillary recreational amenities such as playlots,
playgrounds, swimming pools, tennis courts, and golf courses.
      (2)   Location.
         (a)   An effective open space system should tie together a number of
diverse recreational activity areas with adequate pedestrian pathways and auto/
bicycle access for those it is intended to serve. As many homes as possible
should have direct access to the open space of a development.
         (b)   Active recreation should be visibly close but shall not
interfere with the privacy of adjacent residents. These areas should be
designed to accommodate the recreational needs of the project’s intended age
groups.
         (c)   Wherever feasible, the common open space shall connect into
existing county parks, recreation lands, historic sites, or lands proposed for
park, recreation, or conservation in the Comprehensive Plan, or lands in
adjacent developments that are set aside, or proposed to be set aside, for
common open space.
   (D)   Preservation open space and recreational open space. As a landscape
feature and asset, permanently protected open space is encouraged in all
developments, even when not required. The objectives of open space preservation
is to provide the opportunity and space for active and passive recreation in
all areas of human activity and residence, to protect and enhance the county’s
natural amenities such as wooded areas, waterbodies, streams, greenbelts, and

enclosure and separation from parking areas, and protection from sun and wind.
Sitting areas with benches or seat walls shall be provided.
   (G)   Recreational facilities.
      (1)   Bike/hike paths. Bike/hike paths should be used to connect open
spaces between recreational facilities and between residential buildings and
other uses. Vehicular conflicts with open space pathways are discouraged.
Depending on use and location, bike/hike paths shall be asphalt, concrete,
gravel, soil, cement, stabilized earth, or wood planking and be of a width
suitable for the projected use.
      (2)   Play lots. Play lots shall be a minimum of 2,000 square feet for
toddlers and up to 5,000 square feet for older children. They are primarily
used by preschool age children. Facilities include swings, slides, play
sculptures, and benches for parents. One play lot for the first 50 dwellings
and one additional play lot for each of the next 100 dwellings shall be
provided.
      (3)   Playgrounds. Playgrounds are designed for a variety of uses and the
equipment selected should reflect anticipated patronage. Sandboxes and play
sculptures should be provided for young children and basketball courts/
backboards and tennis courts for active participants of all ages. The size of

development containing 200-plus dwelling units. A series of smaller pools
relating to individual housing groups should be considered instead of a
centrally located, large pool. Wading pools should be provided where the
anticipated child population indicates that they will be used.
      (6)   Community buildings. In developments of over 150 dwelling units,
consideration shall be given toward a recreation center/community multipurpose
building. Such facilities should be within walking or easy biking distance of
the majority of residents it is intended to serve.
      (7)   Other amenities. Jogging trails and exercise stations, benches and
sitting areas, and community garden plots are other amenities which may warrant
consideration.
      (8)   Waiving provisions. The provision of recreational facilities may be
waived in whole or in part by the plan-approving authority given the nature of
the development and the demographic profile of its anticipated residents.
   (H)   Completion of improvements prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy. Recreational and open space facilities and improvements shall be
completed and available for use prior to the issuance of any certificates of
occupancy for dwelling units in the development. The plan-approving authority
may, however, approve a phased development schedule for recreational facilities
which generally corresponds to the overall phasing of the development itself.
   (I)   Ownership and maintenance of common open space.
      (1)   Ownership methods. The type of ownership of land dedicated for open

homeowners’ association or a similar entity approved by the authority which
assumes full responsibility for its maintenance.
         (c)   Deed-restricted private ownership which shall prevent
development and/or subsequent subdivision of the common open space land and
provide for the maintenance responsibility of the deed restriction.
      (2)   May not be dissolved. Ownership organizations shall not be
dissolved and shall not dispose of any open space, by sale or otherwise, except
to an organization conceived and established to own and maintain common open
space for the benefit of the development.
      (3)   Property owners’ association. If the open space is owned and
maintained by a homeowner or condominium association, the developer shall
submit a declaration of covenants and restrictions that will govern the
association, with the application for the preliminary approval. The provisions
shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
         (a)   The homeowners’ association must be established before the homes
are sold;
         (b)   Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any
successive buyer;
         (c)   The open space restrictions must be permanent, not just for a
period of years;
         (d)   The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities;
         (e)   Homeowners must pay their annual pro rata share of the cost; the
assessment levied by the association may become a lien on the property if
provided for in the master deed establishing the homeowners’ association; and
         (f)   The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
      (4)   County acceptance or acquisition of common open space.
         (a)   Any lands offered to the county shall be located and of a size
that will best suit the purposes for which the lands are intended, and be
conveyed by deed at the time final approval is granted subject to approval by
the plan-approving authority (and the Board of Supervisors where lands are
offered to the county).
         (b)   Where a proposed park, public waterway, and/or waterfront access
site, playground, school, refuse container site, public safety facility, or
other public facility or public use as shown on the Comprehensive Plan is
located in whole or in part on land within a development, the land shall be
dedicated or reserved for purchase by the county or other appropriate agency.
         (c)   Land reserved for public purchase shall be shown on recorded
plats as lots by means of dashed lines and numbers on the preliminary and final
plats and may be sold as such without filing an amended plat. If public action
to acquire the land has not been initiated within 18 months of recording the
final plat, the owners of said lots may obtain permits for the development
given the county’s relinquishment of rights to purchase.

         (b)   Measuring methodology. For the purpose of measuring the
intensity or frequency of sound, a sound level meter, octave band analyzer, and
an impact noise analyzer shall be employed. The “C” network and the “slow”
meter response of the sound level meter shall be used. Sounds of short
duration, which cannot be measured accurately with the sound level meter, shall
be measured with an impact noise analyzer to determine the peak value of the
impact. For sounds so measured, the sound pressure levels set forth above in
division (C)(1)(a) above may be increased by six decibels. Sounds produced by
the operation of motor vehicles or other transportation facilities shall not be
included in determining the maximum permitted decibel levels unless associated
with a mining activity.

adjoining residence; and
               b.   Five-hundredths when measured at a lot line adjacent to the
vibrating activity.
            2.   Impact vibrations may be at twice the maximum for steady-state
vibration.
         (b)   Measuring methodology. Steady-state vibrations (discrete pulses
that occur more frequently than 60 times per minute), impact vibrations (earth-
borne oscillations occurring in discrete pulses at or less than 60 pulses per
minute), and vibration frequency (number of oscillations per second) shall be
measured with a three-component measuring system. The displacement shall be the
maximum instantaneous vector sum of the amplitude in the three directions.
      (3)   Air pollution. The rules and regulations of the State Air Pollution
Control Board shall apply to the emission of air contaminants from any source
associated with any land use activity.

      (9)   Toxic matter. The emission of chemicals, gases, components, or
elements listed as being toxic matter by the Environmental Protection Agency or
any state regulatory boards, including the State Water Control Board and State
Air Pollution Control Board, shall only be permitted if the emissions comply
with regulatory standards. An entity emitting toxic matter shall advise local
emergency service (fire and rescue) facilities of such so that emergency
service personnel will be able to respond knowledgeably and effectively in the
event emergency services must be administered.
      (10)   Odor. No odor shall be emitted that is detectable by the human
sense at or beyond an adjacent lot line so as to be detrimental or injurious to
the life, health, safety, comfort, or welfare of adjacent occupants or
residents. There is hereby established as a guide in determining such
quantities of offensive odors, Table III (Odor Thresholds) in Chapter 5 of the

completed or in the process of being completed on the date a completed
application for a intensive agricultural facility is received by the Land Use
Administrator.
      INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL FACILITY. Those intensive agricultural operations
commonly known as confinement operations, where large numbers of animals are
confined to a relatively small space and therefore tend to produce odors,
flies, rats, and noise and may contaminate ground and surface waters and which
include such operations as hog, veal, and poultry pens and houses, feedlots for
beef, sheep, and other animals, and dairy operations. For the purpose of this
section, any enclosure, pen, or building for the concentrated confinement of
livestock or fowl wherein more than 100 veal animals, slaughter or feeder
cattle, 200 mature dairy cattle, 750 swine, 150 horses, 3,000 sheep, lambs,
goats, or similar animals, 16,500 turkeys or 30,000 laying hens or broilers are
confined or housed shall constitute intensive agriculture. Occasional
confinement that does not exceed 90 days in a given 365-day period shall not be
considered INTENSIVE.
      LIVESTOCK RAISER, DAIRY OPERATOR, POULTRY GROWER. The owner of the
livestock, dairy or poultry facility, or the land on which the facility is
located.
   (C)   Minimum acreage requirements. The minimum number of acres on which an

      (2)   Intensive poultry facility. Twenty acres or the number of acres
required by an approved nutrient management plan, whichever is greater. All
parcels of land which comprise the facility must be contiguous, however, the
area used for the nutrient management need not be contiguous. The operator
shall provide evidence acceptable to the Land Use Administrator of the right of
use or proof of ownership of any noncontiguous parcels associated with the
nutrient management plan.
      (3)   Nonconforming uses. Existing livestock, dairy, or poultry
facilities in existence and in operation on the effective date of this section
as determined by the Land Use Administrator that do not meet the minimum
acreage requirement, shall be considered nonconforming uses and may continue or
be expanded as provided in §

it remains in effect, the planned facilities shall be obligated to meet
setbacks only from those dwelling and uses existing at the time the development
plan is approved. The Land Use Administrator shall approve the development plan
within 45 days of receipt if such development plan meets the requirements of
this section. However, if the development plan does not meet the requirements
of this section, the Land Use Administrator shall return the development plan
to the person who submitted it, together with a written description of the
portions of the development plan that did not comply with this section.
      (2)   The development plan shall be based upon the requirements of this
section and shall be accompanied by a plat or similar documentation acceptable
to the Land Use Administrator verifying the accuracy of the distances shown in
the development plan and containing all the data required as specified pursuant
to this section.
      (3)   The development plan shall remain in force only so long as the
facilities proposed are constructed in accordance with the development plan and
the provisions of this section. Any variation from the development plan will
cause the plan to be null and void and the operator out of compliance with this
section.
      (4)   At least one-third of the number of head of livestock or dairy
animals, subject to this section or one poultry facility indicated in the
development plan must be placed into service within two years of the date in
which the development plan is approved by the Land Use Administrator, unless at
least one-third of the number of livestock, dairy, or one such poultry facility
is already in service on the subject parcel or parcels at the time the
development plan is filed. Zoning approval for any subsequent facilities
indicated in the development plan may be obtained if no more than five years
have passed since the date on which the development plan was approved by the
Land Use Administrator. Otherwise, a new development plan shall be filed and
approved by the Land Use Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this
section then in effect.
      (5)   The operator shall notify the Land Use Administrator in writing a
minimum of 30 days prior to placement into service any facilities indicated in
the development plan.
      (6)   In the event an operator fails to build the proposed facility or
have in place this minimum number of animals required or fails to obtain zoning
approval for any of the facilities indicated in the development plan within the
applicable time, the Land Use Administrator shall revoke the development plan.
All future development plans for facilities on the subject parcel or parcels
shall conform to the requirements of this section in effect at the time such
future plan is submitted for approval.
      (7)   Each parcel for which a development plan has been approved shall
display at its entrance, within 15 days of said approval, a sign not less than
two square feet or larger than four square feet, clearly visible from the

and containing the words “Certified Agricultural Development Site”.
Fabrication, installation, maintenance, and all costs of the signs shall be the
responsibility of the operator.
      (8)   Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit an operator or a
potential operator from submitting amendments to the original development plan
or to submitting revised development plans for approval.
   (G)   Nutrient management plan.
      (1)   On or after the effective date of this amendment to this chapter,
no intensive agricultural facility shall commence operation until a nutrient
management plan for the proposed facility has been reviewed and approved by the
State Department of Conservation and Recreation or by State Cooperative
Extension Service or by a person certified or employed by the county as a
nutrient management specialist.
      (2)   If off-site disposal for dry waste is part of the nutrient
management plan and is otherwise permitted under the provisions of this
section, the operator shall provide, as part of that nutrient management plan,
written documentation of an agreement with the receiver of the waste produced
at the operator’s facility or an affidavit, sworn and subscribed before a
notary public, that states the intention to dispose of the waste through sale
in retail establishments or otherwise to consumers. Documentation shall specify
the duration of the agreement and the nature of the application or use of the
waste. A nutrient management plan containing such an agreement shall be valid
only as long as the agreement remains in force and shall be reviewed whenever
such an agreement expires or is terminated by either party. The operator shall
notify the Land Use Administrator in writing at least 30 days before the
expiration of any such agreement or within five days after any such agreement
is terminated before its stated expiration date.
      (3)   The nutrient management plan shall also provide for a site, with a
permanent structure, for the storage of animal wastes which shall meet all
applicable requirements and standards of the state or any department or
political division thereof. If an operator is unable to locate a site on the
same parcel because of insufficient acreage or topographical hardship, then the
Land Use Administrator, after consultation with the operator’s engineer, may
permit the storage site to be located on land owned by the operator adjacent to
the facility; or, if there is a valid agreement for off-site disposal as
provided by this section, the Land Use Administrator may permit the storage
site to be located on a parcel specified in the agreement for such off-site
disposal.
      (4)   The nutrient management plan unless sooner required by the
provisions of this section, or by the state or any department or division or by
the county, shall be reviewed and updated every ten years by an agent of the
State Department of Conservation and Recreation or by the State Cooperative
Extension Service or by a person certified or employed by the state or the
county as a nutrient management specialist.

above, then a detailed explanation must be provided as to why a site of a
higher priority was not selected. The person seeking such an exception must
satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be
granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the
applicant if the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
      (3)   An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating the
site presented is the only site leased or selected. An application shall
address collocation as an option and if such option is not proposed, the
applicant must explain why collocation is commercially or otherwise
impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting
collocation, shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial
impracticability or hardship.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the above, the Board may approve any site located
within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the Board finds
that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety, and
welfare of the county and its inhabitants.
      (5)   The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant’s review of the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating

pre-application meeting and the county will maintain a separate escrow account
for all such funds. The county’s consultants/experts shall bill or invoice the
county no more frequently than monthly for its services in reviewing the
application and performing its duties. If at any time during the review process
this escrow account has a balance less than $2,500, the applicant shall
immediately, upon notification by the county, replenish said escrow account so
that it has a balance of at least $5,000. Such additional escrow funds shall be
deposited with the county before any further action or consideration is taken
on the application. In the event that the amount held in escrow by the county
is more than the amount of the actual billing or invoicing at the conclusion of
the project, the difference shall be promptly refunded to the applicant.
      (3)   The total amount of the funds set forth in division (L)(2) above
may vary with the scope and complexity of the project, the completeness of the

§ 157.109  SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS.
   (A)   Findings of fact. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community, presented by the
public and in reports made available to the Board, and on findings incorporated
in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatre, Inc. 475 U.S. 41 (1986);
Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theatre,
Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 120 S. Ft. 1382 (2000);
and Steakhouse, Inc. v. City of Raleigh, 166 F.3d 634 (4th Cir. 1999), cert.
denied, 70 U.S.L.W. 3460 (2002), and on studies in other communities including
Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Austin,
Texas; and also on findings from the report of the Attorney General’s workgroup
on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses (June 6, 1989, State of
Minnesota), the Board of Supervisors of the county makes the following
findings.
      (1)   Sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful
sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual
nature, as well as the sale, use, and/or display of obscene materials and
obscenity.
      (2)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of the county, which demands reasonable regulation of sexually
oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of the
citizens.
      (3)   There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented
businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around
them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased
crime and blight and the downgrading of property values and the quality of life
in the adjacent area.
      (4)   At least one court of competent jurisdiction has ruled that the
visual display of the human sex act and/or other prohibited sex acts are
obscene.
      (5)   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities and/or obscenity.
      (6)   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses engage in a
higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of
other establishments.
      (7)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
sexually oriented businesses. Offering or providing such space encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
      (8)   Persons frequent sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of
engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses.
      (9)   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including syphilis, gonorrhea, human
immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non
A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections.
      (10)   Since 1981 to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) in the United States.
      (11)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his or her report of
October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may
be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood components, and from an infected mother to the newborn.
      (12)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (13)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because of the activities conducted there are unhealthy
and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the
failure of the owners of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and
maintain those facilities.
      (14)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view films depicting
specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.
   (B)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   It is the purpose and intent of this section to establish content-
neutral regulations that address the secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses detailed in division (A) above.
      (2)   It is the desire of the Board of Supervisors to minimize and
control the secondary effects listed in division (A) above and thereby protect
the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county, protect the
citizens from increased crime, preserve the quality of life within the county,
preserve the property values and character of residential areas, and prevent
obscenity and the spreading of blight within the county.
      (3)   It is not the intent of the Board of Supervisors or this chapter to
suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution or the state’s Constitution.

specified in division (B) below, shall be deemed a misdemeanor and shall be
punishable by a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $1,000. Each day such
violation exists shall constitute a separate offense.
