assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be 1%
per month, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.
   (B)   Late filing and payment penalties. If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty, of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return
shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall be
imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.
(Ord. O-16-25, passed 12-13-2016)
§ 35.140 ABATEMENT.
   The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any
late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the

§ 35.141 INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.
   The city may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any Installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14 day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,
the installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the
taxpayer.
(Ord. O-16-25, passed 12-13-2016)
§ 35.142 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   The city, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns

owing. The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving notice of the reviewed
tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still due and
owing.
   (A)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the city,
the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations shall
be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which return for the
applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was filed.
   (C)   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax return
was filed by the taxpayer.

§ 35.143 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before
the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.

standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the City
Clerk's Office.
(Ord. O-16-25, passed 12-13-16)
§ 35.145 INTERNAL REVIEW.
   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   (B)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(Ord. O-16-25, passed 12-13-16)
§ 35.146 APPLICATION.

conflict with or inconsistent with this subchapter, this subchapter shall be
controlling.

POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 36.80 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VI of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the City of Galena to prohibit harassment of
any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All
municipalofficials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal
agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person,
regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. O.18.16, passed 9-24-18)
§ 36.81 DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   This policy adopts the definition of SEXUAL HARASSMENT as stated in
the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an Individual’s employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual Is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
Interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature. Non-verbal: suggestive or
insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive
bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing” noises.
         (b)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (c)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (d)     Textual/electronic: “sexting” (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
   (B)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
(Ord. O.18.16, passed 9-24-18)
§ 36.82 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, Including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel. 
         (a)   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or In the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the city administrator, or the mayor.
         (a)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaintowith
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Ord. O.18.16, passed 9-24-18)
§ 36.83 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (D)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs
in retallatlon for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;

conducting an investigation. hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee; or
      (3)   Assists or pa rticipates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, § 15(a)), an
employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a
court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or
committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a State or federal
law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an
employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,
where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation (ILCS Ch.
740, Act 174, § 15(b)).
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act 5, § 6-
101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which
he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a tower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of
the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. O.18.16, passed 9-24-18)
§ 36.84 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or
the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 565,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
(Ord. O.18.16, passed 9-24-18)
§ 36.85 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   (A)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
   (B)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
State’s Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

residential living units shall pay a garbage collection fee to be set by the
City Council from time to time per unit per month, payable monthly in advance.
      (2)   Licensed bed and breakfast units shall pay an amount equal to two
times the regular residential unit fee and shall be allowed twice the amount of
containers as authorized for regular residential units.
      (3)   Owners of real estate shall be jointly and severally liable for all
garbage collection fees of tenants residing in rental units of such owner.
      (4)   Each occupied rental unit shall be charged a separate residential
unit garbage collection fee per month.
         (a)   Prior to September 1, 2009, each such residential unit shall be
allowed two 30-gallon containers for delivery of garbage and refuse to the
collector per week for the above garbage collection fee.
         (b)   Beginning on September 1, 2009, each such residential unit shall
be allowed one 45-gallon container for delivery of garbage and refuse to the
collector per week for the above garbage collection fee.
      (5)   All additional 45-gallon containers or other similar containers
having a total weight not exceeding 40 pounds, shall have attached to them, in
and at a location easily visible to the collector, a tag provided by the
collector and available at City Hall and other locations as the city may
determine. Such tags may be purchased at a rate to be set from time to time by
the City Council. Each tag purchased shall permit an additional container not
exceeding 45 gallons or an additional 40-pound bag per pick-up. Not more than
two tags may be used per pick-up date. As an alternative to purchasing a tag, a
resident may pay a fee to be set by the city from time to time by ordinance or
resolution for weekly pick-up of one additional garbage container not exceeding
45 gallons or 40 pounds.
   (B)   Residential rental units or unoccupied residences.
      (1)   All owners of residential rental units shall notify city staff when
a unit is rented and when a unit is vacant. Failure to so notify city staff
when a unit is occupied shall cause the owner to be required to pay all garbage
collection fees from the time the unit is rented. When a rental unit becomes
unoccupied and is not immediately rented to another tenant, the owner of a
rental unit shall be required to pay the monthly garbage collection fee. When a
rental unit has been unoccupied for not less than two consecutive complete
months, the owner may request discontinuation of garbage collection fees from
the time of application until the unit is again occupied or water use at the
unit exceeds 1,000 gallons, whichever occurs first. Once the unit is occupied
or water usage exceeds 1,000 gallons in such residence, garbage collection fees
shall be reinstated in full.
      (2)   Any owner who intends to leave and not occupy their primary
residence for a period of not less than two consecutive months, or any owner no
longer occupying but actively attempting to sell what was their primary
residence, may request discontinuation of garbage collection fees for the
period of the absence or until the property is sold. Garbage collection fees
shall only be discontinued for those months where there is no occupancy for the
entire month and when the owner notifies the city prior to the absence. Garbage
collection fees shall not be reinstated until such time as said residence is
again occupied or water use at the residence exceeds 1,000 gallons, whichever
occurs first.
   (C)   When due and payable. All bills for service shall be rendered as of
the first day of the monthly period for which the service is billed and shall
be payable not later than the close of business on the fifteenth day from the
date of the bill.
   (D)   Monthly penalty charge. If payment of the full amount of the bills is
not made within said period, then a penalty charge of 10% of the portion of the
bill not timely paid shall be added thereto on a monthly basis until paid in
full.
   (E)   Lien. In the event that such charges are not paid within 30 days after
rendition of the bill for such service, such charges shall be deemed and hereby
are declared to be delinquent and, thereafter, such delinquencies shall
constitute liens upon the real estate upon or for which service is supplied.
The city shall send to the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as
referenced by the taxpayer’s identification number, (i) a copy of each
delinquency notice sent to the person who is delinquent in paying the charges
or rates or other notice sufficient to inform the owner or owners of record, as
referenced by the taxpayer’s identification number, that the charges or rates
have become delinquent and (ii) a notice that unpaid charges or rates may
create a lien on the real estate under this section. Such lien shall be subject
to the rights of any purchaser, mortgagee, judgment creditor, or other lien
holder arising prior to the filing of the notice of such a lien in the office
of the recorder of deeds of Jo Daviess County. This notice shall consist of a
sworn statement setting out (1) a description of such real estate sufficient
for the identification thereof, (2) the amount of money due for such service,
and (3) the date when such amount became delinquent. The City Clerk shall send
a copy of the notice of the lien to the owner or owners of record of the real
estate, as referenced by the taxpayer’s identification number by registered
mail, return receipt requested. The city may foreclose this lien in the same
manner and with the same effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real
estate. The city may, from time to time, sue the owner of record or occupant or
user of the real estate in a civil action to recover the money due for services
rendered, plus a reasonable attorney’s fee, to be fixed by the court. Whenever
a judgment is entered in such a civil action the foregoing provisions in this
section with respect to filing sworn statements of such delinquencies in the
office of the recorder and creating a lien against the real estate shall not be
effective thereafter as to charges sued upon and no lien shall exist thereafter
against the real estate for the delinquency. Judgment in such a civil action
operates as a release and waiver of the lien for the amount of the judgment.

§ 51.012 DELINQUENT CHARGES; DISCONTINUATION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Lien. In the event that such charges are not paid within 30 days after
the date of the bill for such service, such charges shall be deemed and hereby
are declared to be delinquent and, thereafter, such delinquencies shall
constitute liens upon the real estate for which service is supplied. The city
shall send to the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as referenced
by the taxpayer’s identification number: (i) a delinquency notice sufficient to
inform the owner or owners of record, as referenced by the taxpayer’s
identification number, that the charges or rates have become delinquent and are
due in full to prevent disconnection of service by the city, and (ii) a notice
that failure to pay all unpaid account charges or rates may create a lien on
the real estate under this section. Such lien shall be subject to the rights of
any purchaser, mortgagee, judgment creditor, or other lien holder arising prior
to the filing of the notice of such a lien in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds of Jo Daviess County. This notice shall consist of a sworn statement
setting out (1) a description of such real estate sufficient for the
identification thereof, (2) the amount of money due for such service, and (3)
the date when such amount became delinquent. The City Clerk shall send a copy
of the notice of the lien to the owner or owners of record of the real estate,
as referenced by the taxpayer’s identification number by registered mail,
return receipt requested. The city may foreclose this lien in the same manner
and with the same effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate. The
city may, from time to time, sue the owner of record or occupant or user of the
real estate in a civil action to recover the money due for services rendered,
plus a reasonable attorney’s fee, to be fixed by the court. Whenever a judgment
is entered in such a civil action the foregoing provisions in this section with
respect to filing sworn statements of such delinquencies in the office of the
Recorder and creating a lien against the real estate shall not be effective
thereafter as to charges sued upon and no lien shall exist thereafter against
the real estate for the delinquency. Judgment in such a civil action operates
as a release and waiver of the lien for the amount of the judgment.
   (B)   Repayment contract. Users who become delinquent with payments and
cannot make the payment in full, may at the city’s sole discretion enter into a
repayment contract with the city. Said agreement shall set forth the terms of
the repayment of delinquent charges as well as penalties to be charged therein.
The city shall consider the financial status of the use, frequency of
delinquencies and the amount of charges due the city in determining whether to
offer a repayment contract to the user. In no case shall the repayment term
exceed six months. Users failure to abide by the agreement shall void the
contract, accelerate amounts due and subject the user to a water shutoff
without further notice.
   (C)   Deposits required. The city may require a cash deposit as set by the
city of those consumers who are frequently delinquent with their payments. For
the purposes of this division, FREQUENTLY DELINQUENT means not being current
with service charges for three billing periods in any fiscal year.
   (D)   Hearing procedure.
      (1)   It is the policy of the city to discontinue utility service to
customers by reason of nonpayment of bills only after notice and a meaningful
opportunity to be heard on disputed bills. The city’s form for application for
utility service and all bills shall contain, in addition to the title, address,
room number, and telephone number of the official in charge of billing, clearly
visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
         (a)   That all bills are due and payable on or before the date set
forth on the bill;
         (b)   That if any bill is not paid by or before that date, service
will be discontinued; and
         (c)   That any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill
shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.
      (3)   When it becomes necessary for the city to discontinue utility
service to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only
after all bills for service then due have been paid, along with a turn-on
charge in an amount to be set by the City Council from time to time by
resolution or ordinance.

vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the
intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering
the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
shown.
      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and the city
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one- way street, after stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2)
of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways. The driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)   After stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this
section, the driver of a motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal
which fails to change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not
less than 120 seconds because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has
failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle’s
size or weight, shall have the right to proceed, after yielding the right of
way to oncoming traffic facing a green signal, subject to the rules applicable
after making a stop at a stop sign as required by §
70.61.
      (5)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in §
70.52, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall
not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made; or, in the absence of
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

SPEED RESTRICTIONS
§ 71.001 SPEED LIMITS.
   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this city at a speed
which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.
Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person
or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and
the duty of all persons to use due care.
   (A-5)   For purposes of this section, URBAN DISTRICT does not include any
interstate highway as defined by ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 1-133.1 of this Code
which includes all highways under the jurisdiction of the Illinois State Toll
Highway Authority.
   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which is
greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
divisions (C) and (D) below, by §
71.002, or by a regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.
   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in an urban district (as defined in §
70.01) for all vehicles is:
      (1)   Thirty miles per hour; and
      (2)   Fifteen miles per hour in an alley.
   (D)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for any vehicle is 65 miles
per hour for all or part of highways that are designated by the Department,
have at least four lanes of traffic, and have a separation between the roadways
moving in opposite directions and 55 miles per hour for all other highways,
roads, and streets.

   (B)   On a school day when school children are present and so close thereto
that a potential hazard exists because of the close proximity of the motorized
traffic, no person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in excess of 20 miles
per hour while passing a school zone or while traveling on a local, county, or
state roadway on public school property or upon any public thoroughfare where
children pass going to and from school.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, a school day begins at 6:30 a.m. and
concludes at 4:00 p.m.
   (D)   This section shall not be applicable unless appropriate signs are
posted upon streets and highways under their respective jurisdiction and
maintained by the department, township, county, park district, city, village or
incorporated town wherein the school zone is located. With regard to the
special speed limit while passing schools, such signs shall give proper due
warning that a school zone is being approached and shall indicate the school
zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when school
children are present.
   (E)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of electronic speed-
detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special school speed zone
indicating such zone, as defined in this section, nor shall evidence obtained
thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding provided the use of
such device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in such
special school speed zone.
   (F)   Except as provided in division (G) of this section, a person who
violates this section is guilty of a petty offense. Violations of this section
are punishable with a minimum fine of $150 for the first violation, a minimum
fine of $300 for the second or subsequent violation, and community service in
an amount determined by the court.

entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then
at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of
approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the
intersection. After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to
any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another roadway, or which
is approaching so closely on the roadway as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when the driver is moving across or within the intersection,
but the driver, having so yielded, may proceed as soon as a safe interval
occurs.
   (C)   The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall, in obedience
to the sign, slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions, and,
if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but

§ 71.066 OPERATION OF VEHICLES ON APPROACH OF AUTHORIZED EMERGENCY VEHICLES.
   (A)   Upon the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle making
use of audible and visual signals meeting the requirements of this chapter, or
a police vehicle properly and lawfully making use of an audible or visual
signal, the driver of every other vehicle shall yield the right-of-way and
shall immediately drive to a position parallel to, and as close as possible to,
the right-hand edge or curb of the highway clear of any intersection, and
shall, if necessary to permit the safe passage of the emergency vehicle, stop
and remain in that position until the authorized emergency vehicle has passed,
unless otherwise directed by a police officer.
   (B)   This section shall not operate to relieve the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all
persons using the highway.
   (C)   Upon approaching a stationary authorized emergency vehicle that is
giving a signal by displaying alternately flashing red, red and white, blue, or
red and blue lights or amber or yellow warning lights, a person who drives an
approaching vehicle shall:
      (1)   Proceeding with due caution, yield the right-of-way by making a
lane change into a lane not adjacent to that of the authorized emergency
vehicle, if possible with due regard to safety and traffic conditions, if on a
highway having at least four lanes with not less than two lanes proceeding in
the same direction as the approaching vehicle; or
      (2)   If changing lanes would be impossible or unsafe, proceeding with
due caution, reduce the speed of the vehicle, maintaining a safe speed for road
conditions and leaving a safe distance until safely past the stationary
vehicle.
      (3)   The visual signal specified under this division (C) given by an
authorized emergency vehicle is an indication to drivers of approaching
vehicles that a hazardous condition is present when circumstances are not
immediately clear. Drivers of vehicles approaching a stationary emergency
vehicle in any lane shall heed the warning of the signal, reduce the speed of
the vehicle, proceed with due caution, maintain a safe speed for road
conditions, be prepared to stop, and leave a safe distance until safely passed
the stationary emergency vehicle.
      (4)   As used herein, AUTHORIZED EMERGENCY VEHICLE includes any vehicle
authorized by law to be equipped with oscillating, rotating, or flashing lights
under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5,§ 12-215, while its owner or operator is engaged in
his or her official duties.
   (D)   Penalty for violation of division (C).
       (1)   A person who violates division (C) commits a business offense
punishable by a fine of not less than $250 or more than $10,000 for a first
violation, and a fine of not less than $750 or more than $10,000 for a second
or subsequent violation. It is a factor in aggravation if the person committed
the offense while in violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 11-501, 12-610.1, or
12-610.2. Imposition of the penalties authorized by this division for a
violation of division (C) of this section that results in the death of another
person does not preclude imposition of appropriate additional civil or criminal
penalties. A person who violates division (C) and the violation results in
damage to another vehicle commits a Class A misdemeanor. A person who violates
division (C) and the violation results in the injury or death of another person
commits a Class 4 felony.
      (2)   If a violation of division (C) results in damage to the property of
another person, in addition to any other penalty imposed, the person's driving
privileges shall be suspended for a fixed period of not less than 90 days and
not more than one year.
      (3)   If a violation of division (C) results in injury to another person,
in addition to any other penalty imposed, the person's driving privileges shall
be suspended for a fixed period of not less than 180 days and not more than two
years.
      (4)   If a violation of division (C) results in the death of another
person, in addition to any other penalty imposed, the person's driving
privileges shall be suspended for two years.

flashing amber light which may be used only when such vehicle is used as a lead
vehicle in such procession. Vehicles comprising a funeral procession may
utilize funeral pennants or flags or windshield stickers or flashing hazard
warning signal flashers to identify the individual vehicles in such a
procession.
   (F)   In the absence of law enforcement traffic control assistance for a
funeral procession, a funeral director or his or her designee may direct
traffic during a funeral procession.

SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED
§ 71.080 OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN OR RAILROAD TRACK
EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet
from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until the tracks
are clear and he or she can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall
apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and such railroad train or railroad track
equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an immediate
hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
   (A-1)   Whenever any person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined
in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where the
driver is not always required to stop, the person must exercise due care and
caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of
danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver
shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of
the railroad and shall not proceed until the tracks are clear and he or she can
do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and such railroad train or railroad track
equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an immediate
hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
   (A-5)   Whenever a person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined in
ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where the
driver is not always required to stop but must slow down, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall slow down within 50 feet but not less than 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she checks that the tracks are clear of an approaching train or railroad track
equipment.
   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while such gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (C)   The department, and local authorities with the approval of the
department, are hereby authorized to designate particularly dangerous highway
grade crossings of railroads and to erect stop signs thereat. When such stop
signs are erected the driver of any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not
less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of such railroad and shall proceed only
upon exercising due care.
   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs,
without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates, or a
human flagman giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad
track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly
marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not less than 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment
after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference
is prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.
   (D-1)   No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to
negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient
undercarriage clearance.
   (E)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section.
      (1)   A violation of this section is a petty offense for which a fine of
$500 shall be imposed for a first violation, and a fine of $1,000 shall be
imposed for a second or subsequent violation. The court may impose 25 hours of
community service in place of the $500 fine for the first violation.

suspend the driving privileges of the offender for a minimum of six months.
   (F)   Corporate authorities of municipal corporations regulating operators
of vehicles that fail to obey signals indicating the presence, approach,
passage, or departure of a train or railroad track equipment shall impose fines
as established in division (E) of this section.

   INOPERABLE MOTOR VEHICLE.  
      (1)   Shall mean any motor vehicle from which, for a period of at least
seven days, the engine, wheels, or other parts have been removed, or on which

parts which are detached and separated from a motor vehicle and which remained
on public or private property for a period of at least seven days.
      (3)   Shall not include a motor vehicle which has been rendered
temporarily incapable of being driven under its own power in order to perform

of a local ordinance is likely, upon release, to commit a subsequent violation
of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501 or a similar provision of a local ordinance,
the arresting officer shall have the vehicle which the person was operating at
the time of the arrest impounded for a period of 12 hours after the time of
arrest. However, such vehicle may be released by the arresting law enforcement
agency prior to the end of the impoundment period if:
      (1)   The vehicle was not owned by the person under arrest, and the
lawful owner requesting such release possesses a valid operator’s license,
proof of ownership, and would not, as determined by the arresting law
enforcement agency, indicate a lack of ability to operate a motor vehicle in a
safe manner, or who would otherwise, by operating such motor vehicle, be in
violation of this ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5; or
      (2)   The vehicle is owned by the person under arrest, and the person
under arrest gives permission to another person to operate such vehicle,
provided however, that the other person possesses a valid operator’s license
and would not, as determined by the arresting law enforcement agency, indicate
a lack of ability to operate a motor vehicle in a safe manner or who would

625, Act 5.
   (F)   (1)   Whenever a registered owner of a vehicle is taken into custody
for operating the vehicle in violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-501 or a
similar provision of a local ordinance or ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 6-303, a law
enforcement officer may have the vehicle immediately impounded for a period not
less than:
         (a)   Twenty-four hours for a second violation of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5,
§ 11-501 or a similar provision of a local ordinance or ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §

      (2)   The vehicle may be released sooner if the vehicle is owned by the
person under arrest and the person under arrest gives permission to another
person to operate the vehicle and that other person possesses a valid
operator's license and would not, as determined by the arresting law
enforcement agency, indicate a lack of ability to operate a motor vehicle in a
safe manner or would otherwise, by operating the motor vehicle, be in violation
of this code.
   (G)   Except as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 18a, the owner or lessor
of privately owned real property within this city, or any person authorized by
such owner or lessor, or the police department in the case of publicly owned
real property may cause any motor vehicle abandoned or left unattended upon
such property without permission to be removed by a towing service without
liability for the costs of removal, transportation, or storage or damage caused
by such removal, transportation, or storage. The towing or removal of any
vehicle from private property without the consent of the registered owner or
other legally authorized person in control of the vehicle is subject to
compliance with the following conditions and restrictions:
      (1)   Any towed or removed vehicle must be stored at the site of the
towing service's place of business. The site must be open during business
hours, and for the purpose of redemption of vehicles, during the time that the
person or firm towing such vehicle is open for towing purposes.
      (2)   The towing service shall within 30 minutes of completion of such
towing or removal, notify the police department of such towing or removal, and
the make, model, color, and license plate number of the vehicle, and shall
obtain and record the name of the person at the police department.
      (3)   If the registered owner or legally authorized person entitled to
possession of the vehicle shall arrive at the scene prior to actual removal or
towing of the vehicle, the vehicle shall be disconnected from the tow truck and
that person shall be allowed to remove the vehicle without interference, upon
the payment of a reasonable service fee of not more than one- half the posted
rate of the towing service as provided in division (6) below, for which a
receipt shall be given.
      (4)   The rebate or payment of money or any other valuable consideration
from the towing service or its owners, managers, or employees to the owners or
operators of the premises from which the vehicles are towed or removed, for the
privilege of removing or towing those vehicles, is prohibited. Any individual
who violates this division (4) shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
      (5)   Except for property appurtenant to and obviously a part of a
single- family residence, and except for instances where notice is personally
given to the owner or other legally authorized person in control of the vehicle
that the area in which that vehicle is parked is reserved or otherwise
unavailable to unauthorized vehicles and they are subject to being removed at
the owner or operator's expense, any property owner or lessor, prior to towing
or removing any vehicle from private property without the consent of the owner
or other legally authorized person in control of that vehicle, must post a
notice meeting the following requirements:
         (a)   1.   Except as provided in division (G)(5)(b) below, the notice
must be prominently placed at each driveway access or curb cut allowing
vehicular access to the property within five feet from the public right-of-way
line. If there are no curbs or access barriers, the sign must be posted not
less than one sign each 100 feet of lot frontage.
            2.   As an alternative to the requirement of division (G)(5)(a)
above, the notice for a parking lot contained within property used solely for a
two-family, three- family, or four-family residence may be prominently placed
at the perimeter of the parking lot, in a position where the notice is visible
to the occupants of vehicles entering the lot.
         (b)   The notice must indicate clearly, in not less than two-inch high
light- reflective letters on a contrasting background, that unauthorized
vehicles will be towed away at the owner's expense.
         (c)   The notice must also provide the name and current telephone
number of the towing service towing or removing the vehicle.
         (d)   The sign structure containing the required notices must be
permanently installed with the bottom of the sign not less than four feet above
ground level, and must be continuously maintained on the property for not less
than 24 hours prior to the towing or removing of any vehicle.
      (6)   Any towing service that tows or removes vehicles and proposes to
require the owner, operator, or person in control of the vehicle to pay the
costs of towing and storage prior to redemption of the vehicle must file and
keep on record with the police department a complete copy of the current rates
to be charged for such services, and post at the storage site an identical rate
schedule and any written contracts with property owners, lessors, or persons in
control of property which authorize them to remove vehicles as provided in this
section. The towing and storage charges, however, shall not exceed the maximum
allowed by the Illinois Commerce Commission under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 18a-
200.
      (7)   No person shall engage in the removal of vehicles from private
property as described in this section without filing a notice of intent in the

towing.
      (8)   No removal of a vehicle from private property shall be done except
upon express written instructions of the owners or persons in charge of the
private property upon which the vehicle is said to be trespassing.
      (9)   Vehicle entry for the purpose of removal shall be allowed with
reasonable care on the part of the person or firm towing the vehicle. Such
person or firm shall be liable for any damages occasioned to the vehicle if
such entry is not in accordance with the standards of reasonable care.
      (10)   Except as authorized by a law enforcement officer, no towing
service shall engage in the removal of a commercial motor vehicle that requires
a commercial driver’s license to operate by operating the vehicle under its own
power on a highway.
      (11)   When a vehicle has been towed or removed pursuant to this section,
it must be released to its owner, custodian, agent, or lienholder within one-
half hour after requested, if such request is made during business hours. Any
vehicle owner, custodian, agent, or lienholder shall have the right to inspect
the vehicle before accepting its return, and no release or waiver of any kind
which would release the towing service from liability for damages incurred
during the towing and storage may be required from any vehicle owner or other
legally authorized person as a condition of release of the vehicle. A detailed,
signed receipt showing the legal name of the towing service must be given to
the person paying towing or storage charges at the time of payment, whether
requested or not.
         (a)   This section shall not apply to law enforcement, firefighting,
rescue, ambulance, or other emergency vehicles which are marked as such or to
property owned by any governmental entity.
         (b)   When an authorized person improperly causes a motor vehicle to
be removed, such person shall be liable to the owner or lessee of the vehicle
for the cost of removal, transportation, and storage, any damages resulting
from the removal, transportation, and storage, attorney’s fee, and court costs.
         (c)   Any towing or storage charges accrued shall be payable in cash
or by cashier’s check, certified check, debit card, credit card, or wire
transfer, at the option of the party taking possession of the vehicle.
      (12)   Towing companies shall also provide insurance coverage for areas
where vehicles towed under the provisions of this chapter will be impounded or
otherwise stored, and shall adequately cover loss by fire, theft, or other
risks.
      (13)   Any person who fails to comply with the conditions or restrictions
of this division shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor and shall be fined
not less than $100 nor more than $500.
   (H)   (1)   When a vehicle is determined to be a hazardous dilapidated motor
vehicle pursuant to ILCS h. 65, Act 5, § 11-40-3.1 or § 5-12002.1 of the
Counties Code, its removal and impoundment by a towing service may be
authorized by the Police Department.
      (2)   When a vehicle removal from either public or private property is
authorized by a law enforcement agency, the owner of the vehicle shall be
responsible for all towing and storage charges.
      (3)   Vehicles removed from public or private property and stored by a
commercial vehicle relocator or any other towing service authorized by a law
enforcement agency in compliance with this section and §§
90.01 and
90.03, or at the request of the vehicle owner or operator, shall be subject to
a possessor lien for services pursuant to the Labor and Storage Lien (Small
Amount) Act. The provisions of Section 1 of that Act relating to notice and
implied consent shall be deemed satisfied by compliance with ILCS Ch. 625, Act
5, § 18a-302 and subsection (6) of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 18a-300. In no event
shall such lien be greater than the rate or rates established in accordance
with subsection (6) of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 18a-200. In no event shall such
lien be increased or altered to reflect any charge for services or materials
rendered in addition to those authorized by this chapter. Every such lien shall
be payable in cash or by cashier's check, certified check, debit card, credit
card, or wire transfer, at the option of the party taking possession of the
vehicle.
      (4)   Any personal property belonging to the vehicle owner in a vehicle
subject to a lien under this division (H) shall likewise be subject to that
lien, excepting only: child restraint systems as defined in Section 4 of the
Child Passenger Protection Act and other child booster seats; eyeglasses; food;
medicine; perishable property; any operator's licenses; any cash, credit cards,
or checks or checkbooks; any wallet, purse, or other property containing any
operator's license or other identifying documents or materials, cash, credit
cards, checks, or checkbooks; and any personal property belonging to a person
other than the vehicle owner if that person provides adequate proof that the
personal property belongs to that person. The spouse, child, mother, father,
brother, or sister of the vehicle owner may claim personal property excepted
under this division (4) if the person claiming the personal property provides
the commercial vehicle relocator or towing service with the authorization of
the vehicle owner.
      (5)   This division (5) applies only in the case of a vehicle that is
towed as a result of being involved in a crash. In addition to the personal
property excepted under division (H)(4) of this section, all other personal
property in a vehicle subject to a lien under this division (H) is exempt from
that lien and may be claimed by the vehicle owner if the vehicle owner provides
the commercial vehicle relocator or towing service with proof that the vehicle
owner has an insurance policy covering towing and storage fees. The spouse,
child, mother, father, brother, or sister of the vehicle owner may claim
personal property in a vehicle subject to a lien under this division (H) if the
person claiming the personal property provides the commercial vehicle relocator
or towing service with the authorization of the vehicle owner and proof that
the vehicle owner has an insurance policy covering towing and storage fees. The
regulation of liens on personal property and exceptions to those liens in the
case of vehicles towed as a result of being involved in a crash are exclusive
powers and functions of the state. A home rule unit may not regulate liens on
personal property and exceptions to those liens in the case of vehicles towed
as a result of being involved in a crash. This division (5) is a denial and
limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection (h) of Section 6
of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.
      (6)   No lien under this division (H) shall: exceed $2,000 in its total
amount; or be increased or altered to reflect any charge for services or
materials rendered in addition to those authorized by this chapter.
(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 4-203(a) - (g))
   (I)   When an abandoned, lost, stolen, or unclaimed vehicle comes into the
temporary possession or custody of a person in this city not the owner of the
vehicle, that person shall immediately notify the Police Department. Upon
receipt of such notification, the police will authorize a towing service to
remove and take possession of the abandoned, lost, stolen, or unclaimed
vehicle. The towing service will safely keep the towed vehicle and its
contents, and maintain a record of the tow as set forth in division (I) below
until the vehicle is claimed by the owner or other person legally entitled to
possession thereof or until it is disposed of as provided in this chapter.
(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 4-202)
   (J)   When a vehicle is authorized to be towed away as provided in this
section:
      (1)   The authorization, any hold order, and any release shall be in
writing, or confirmed in writing, with a copy given to the towing service.
      (2)   The Police Department shall keep and maintain a record of the
vehicle towed, listing the color, year of manufacture, manufacturer’s trade
name, manufacturer’s series name, body style, vehicle identification number,
license plate or digital license plate year and number, and registration
sticker or digital registration sticker year and number displayed on the
vehicle. The record shall also include the date and hour of tow, location towed
from, location towed to, reason for towing, and the name of the officer
authorizing the tow.
      (3)   The owner, operator, or other legally entitled person shall be
responsible to the towing service for payment of applicable removal, towing,
storage, and processing charges and collection costs associated with a vehicle
towed or held under order or authorization of the police department. If a
vehicle towed or held under order or authorization of the police department is
seized by the police department or any other law enforcement or governmental
agency and sold, any unpaid removal, towing, storage, and processing charges
and collection costs shall be paid to the towing service from the proceeds of
the sale. If applicable law provides that the proceeds are to be paid into the
treasury of the appropriate civil jurisdiction, then any unpaid removal,
towing, storage, and processing charges and collection costs shall be paid to
the towing service from the treasury of the civil jurisdiction. That payment
shall not, however, exceed the amount of proceeds from the sale, with the
balance to be paid by the owner, operator, or other legally entitled person.
      (4)   Upon delivery of a written release order to the towing service, a
vehicle subject to a hold order shall be released to the owner, operator, or
other legally entitled person upon proof of ownership or other entitlement and
upon payment of applicable removal, towing, storage, and processing charges and
collection costs.

   Impoundment of vehicle driven by person arrested for driving under the
influence of alcohol, drugs or the like, see ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
§ 90.04 NOTICE TO BE GIVEN TO REGISTERED OWNER, STATE POLICE.
   (A)   (1)   When the police department authorizing the impounding of a

vehicle, provided that if the police department is unable to determine the
identity of the registered owner, lienholder, or other person legally-entitled
to ownership of the impounded vehicle within a ten-day business period after
impoundment, then notification shall be sent no later than two days after the
date the identity of the registered owner, lienholder, or other person legally
entitled to ownership of the impounded vehicle is determined. Exceptions to a

service, by facsimile transmission, or by other means the Secretary of State
deems acceptable.

reinstatement of the person's driving privileges until the fine, charge or cost
has been paid in full. The Clerk shall provide notice to the driver at the
driver's last known address as shown on the court's records, stating that the
action will be effective on the forty-sixth day following the date of the above
notice if payment is not received in full by the court of venue.
   (D)   Following receipt of the report from the Clerk, the Secretary of State
shall make the proper notation to the driver's file to prohibit the renewal,
reissue or reinstatement of the driver's driving privileges. The notation shall
not be removed from the driver's record until the driver satisfies the
outstanding fine, charge or cost and an appropriate notice on a form prescribed
by the Secretary is received by the Secretary from the court of venue, stating
that the fine, charge or cost has been paid in full. Upon payment in full of a
fine, charge or court cost which has previously been reported under this
section as unpaid, the Clerk of the Court shall present the driver with a
signed receipt containing the seal of the court indicating that the fine,
charge or cost has been paid in full and shall forward immediately to the
Secretary of State a notice stating that the fine, charge or cost has been paid
in full.
   (E)   Nothing in this section is intended to place any responsibility upon
the City Clerk to provide any independent notice to the driver of any potential
action to disallow the renewal, reissue or reinstatement of the driver's
driving privileges.

employed to drive off vicious or trespassing animals;
         (b)   By any means to make accessible to any animal, with the intent

owner; in the event the owner cannot be ascertained and located, such operator
shall at once report the accident to the Police Department or to the local
humane society.
   (B)   Exceptions. Nothing in division (A) of this section shall:

§ 91.05 PROCEDURES FOR CRUELTY TO ANIMALS; FINES.
   (A)   Any public health officer, law enforcement officer, licensed
veterinarian or officer or agent may take into custody any animal, upon either
private or public property, which clearly shows evidence of cruelty to animals,
as defined by §
91.04; provided that entry upon private property shall only be accomplished
with the assistance of a law enforcement officer. Such officer, agent or
veterinarian may inspect, care for, or treat such animal or place such animal
in the care of a licensed veterinarian for treatment, boarding or other care
or, if such veterinarian determines that the animal appears to be diseased or
disabled beyond recovery for any useful purpose, for humane destruction.
   (B)   The owner or keeper of an animal destroyed pursuant to division (A) of
this section shall not be entitled to recover damages for the destruction of
such animal unless the owner proves that such destruction was unreasonable and
unwarranted.
   (C)   Expenses incurred for the care, treatment or boarding of any animal
taken into custody pursuant to division (A) of this section pending prosecution
of the owner or keeper of such animal for the crime of cruelty to animals as
defined in §
91.04 shall be assessed to the owner or keeper as a cost of the case if the
owner or keeper is adjudicated guilty of such crime.
   (D)   If a person is adjudicated guilty of the crime of cruelty to animals
as defined in §
91.04 and the court determines that such animal owned or possessed by such
person would be in the future subject to any cruelty to animals, such animal
shall not be returned to or remain with such person. Such animal may be turned
over to a duly incorporated humane society or licensed veterinarian for sale,
adoption or other disposition.
   (E)   Unless the animal obtained pursuant to this section is the evidentiary
subject of a pending prosecution, the owner or keeper of the animal shall have
a maximum of five days after the animal is taken into custody to obtain the
animal from the Jo Daviess County Animal Control (or the Humane Society
facility with which animal control may contract) having custody of the animal.
The Jo Daviess County Animal Control shall notify the owner or keeper of the
animal, if known or reasonably ascertainable. The failure of the owner or
keeper to obtain custody of the animal in the time provided shall provide the
authority for the animal to be disposed of by the Jo Daviess County Animal
Control (or the Humane Society facility with which animal control may contract)
by adoption or destruction. All costs for care of the animal until returned to
the owner or keeper shall be paid by the owner or keeper at the time the animal
is picked up.
   (F)   Violation of §
91.04 shall be a municipal offense and upon conviction, the defendant shall be
fined a minimum fine of $100 and a maximum fine of $750 per offense.
(Ord. O-10-20, passed 6-14-10)
§ 91.06 PICKETING OF DOGS.

designed for that purpose and made from a material that prevents injury to the
animal.
(Ord. O-10-20, passed 6-14-10)
§ 91.07 ANIMAL NUISANCES.
   It shall be unlawful to own any animal, including a dog or cat, in a
residentially-zoned district, which by frequent or long continued noise shall
disturb the comfort or repose of any person within the vicinity of such animal;
or shall by the nature of their maintenance or by the numbers of the same shall
create an offensive odor so as to be objectionable to surrounding residences.
All dogs and cats, in heat, shall be confined in a secure and sufficiently
enclosed area. No person shall own on their premises five or more dogs or cats,
ten weeks in age or older, unless such premises is licensed as a commercial
kennel.
(Ord. O-10-20, passed 6-14-10)
§ 91.08 ANIMAL OWNER RESPONSIBILITY FOR REMOVAL OF ANIMAL EXCREMENT.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to appear with an animal upon the
public right-of-way, within public places or upon the property of another,
absent that person's consent, without some means for removal of excrement that
may be deposited by the animal.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person who is an owner or possessor of an
animal in their care to fail to remove any excrement deposited by the animal
upon any public or private property, other than the property of the owner of
the animal.
   (C)   The provisions of this division shall not apply to persons who have a
physical disability or visual impairment, who are using service dogs, and can

times. Owners of cats and ferrets may retain proof of current rabies
vaccination on their person or premises.

§ 91.21 ANIMALS PROHIBITED TO RUN AT LARGE.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to own or keep a dog or cat or
other animal which runs at large in the city. Knowledge or acquiescence by the

      (1)   The animal is firmly attached to a leash or chain under the
physical control of its owner or keeper;

DANGEROUS DOGS
§ 91.40 DEFINITIONS.
   DANGEROUS DOG, as used in this chapter, shall mean:
      (1)   Any dog with a known propensity, tendency or disposition to attack,
to cause injury, or otherwise threaten the safety of human beings or domestic
animals;
      (2)   Any dog which in a vicious or threatening manner, approaches any
person in apparent attack upon the person while on the streets, sidewalks, or
any public grounds or places; or on private property;
(Ord. 7796)
      (3)   Any dog which attacks or bites, or has attacked or bitten a human
being or domestic animal; or
      (4)   Any dog owned or harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of
dog fighting, or any dog trained for dog fighting. Notwithstanding the
definition of a dangerous dog above, no dog may be declared dangerous if any
injury or damage is sustained by a person or animal who at the time such injury
or damage was sustained, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon
premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the dog, or was teasing,
tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog or was committing or attempting to
commit a crime. No dog may be declared dangerous if an injury or damage was
sustained by a domestic animal which at the time such injury or damage was
sustained was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog. No dog may be
declared dangerous if the dog was protecting or defending a human being within
the immediate vicinity of the dog from an unjustified attack or assault. No dog
may be declared dangerous if the injury or damage was sustained by a chicken or
duck that was not in a fenced or enclosed area on its owner's premises. Nothing
in this subchapter shall be deemed to regulate or prohibit the lawful
maintenance of dogs by law enforcement agencies.
   ENCLOSURE means a fence or structure of at least six feet in height (this is
further limited by the fence height requirements in the Galena Zoning
Ordinance), forming or causing an enclosure suitable to prevent the entry of
young children and suitable to confine a dangerous dog. An enclosure shall be
securely enclosed and locked and designed to prevent the animal from escaping
from the enclosure. An enclosure shall have a secure top suitable to confine a
dangerous dog. If such enclosure has no bottom secured to the sides, the sides
must be embedded into the ground no less than one foot.
   OWNER means an individual who has lawful title to a dog, including the
keeper or harborer of the dog. A parent or legal guardian shall be deemed to be
an owner of dogs owned or maintained by children upon their premises.
(Ord. O-10-20, passed 6-14-10)
§ 91.41 PROCEDURE FOR THE DETERMINATION OF A DANGEROUS DOG.
   In the event that an animal control officer or law enforcement officer has
probable cause to believe that a dog is dangerous, as defined by §
91.40, the Court shall be empowered to convene a hearing for the purpose of
determining whether or not the dog in question should be declared dangerous as
defined by §
91.40. The animal control officer or law enforcement officer may order the dog
to be impounded at a licensed veterinary clinic or humane society pending the
determination of whether the dog is dangerous. The owner or keeper of the dog
shall be liable for the costs of keeping such dog. The animal control officer
or law enforcement officer shall notify the owner or keeper of the dog that the
hearing will be held, at which time evidence will be presented that the dog is
dangerous and at which time the owner or keeper of the dog may present evidence
to rebut evidence presented by the city and present such other evidence as may
be relevant. The failure of the owner or keeper to attend or participate in the
hearing shall not keep the court from making the appropriate determination
concerning the dog. The hearing shall be held promptly within no less than five
nor more than 20 days after service of notice upon the owner or keeper of the
dog. The city shall have the burden of proof to show that the dog is dangerous
pursuant to §
91.40. After the hearing, the owner or keeper of the dog shall be notified in
writing of the determination. If a determination is made that the dog is
dangerous, the owner or keeper shall comply with the provisions of this chapter
within 15 days. If the owner fails to comply with the provisions of this
chapter within the time provided, the dog shall be destroyed. If the owner or
keeper of the dog contests the determination, he or she may appeal within ten
days to the court pursuant to law.
(Ord. O-10-20, passed 6-14-10)
§ 91.42 CONTROL OF DANGEROUS DOG; REGISTRATION AND CONFINEMENT.
   If the court determines that a dog is dangerous pursuant to this chapter,
the owner or keeper of the dangerous dog shall be required to comply with the
following:
   (A)   Registration. The owner or keeper shall annually register the
dangerous dog with the city, on such forms designated by the City Clerk, and
shall have a microchip inserted into the dog by the Humane Society. The
microchip shall detail the dangerous dog registration and such other
information as may be appropriate to determine the ownership of the dog. The
owner or keeper shall pay an annual registration fee to be set by the City
Council from time to time and shall pay all costs associated with the microchip
procedure and registration of the dog. The owner or keeper shall be responsible
for maintaining with the City Clerk the address of the owner or keeper and the
dangerous dog. The owner or keeper shall notify the City Clerk within seven
days of a change in address for the owner or keeper and dangerous dog.
   (B)   Confinement. All dangerous dogs shall be confined in an enclosure. It
shall be unlawful for any owner or keeper to maintain a dangerous dog upon any
premises that does not have a locked enclosure. It shall be unlawful for any
owner or keeper to allow a dangerous dog to be outside of the dwelling of the
owner or keeper or outside the enclosure unless it is necessary for the owner
or keeper to obtain veterinary care for the dangerous dog or for the limited
purposes of allowing said dangerous dog to urinate or defecate or to sell or
give away the dangerous dog or respond to such orders of law enforcement
officials as may be required. In such event, the dangerous dog shall be
securely muzzled and restrained with a leash not exceeding four feet in length,
and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the owner or keeper of
the dangerous dog. The muzzle shall be made and used in a manner that will not
cause injury to the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration, but shall
prevent it from biting any human or animal.
(Ord. O-10-20, passed 6-14-10)
§ 91.43 DOGS; THREATS TO PUBLIC SAFETY.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary and
irrespective of whether the dog has been declared dangerous pursuant to this
chapter, the court may order any dog destroyed if the judge determines that the
dog is an immediate threat to public health and safety and that confinement and
registration of the dog by the owner or keeper of the dog as provided in this
chapter will not adequately protect public health and safety. No person shall
harbor, own, or possess a dog that is an immediate threat to public health and
safety. In making such determination the court may consider the severity of the
attack and such other relevant information.
(Ord. O-10-20, passed 6-14-10)
BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS
§ 91.60 SHOOTING OR MOLESTING BIRDS, SQUIRRELS.

and his surety. A bond may be given under this provision which shall remain in
force for two years conditioned as above, in the amount specified above and in
other respects as specified above, but applicable as to all excavation work in
streets by the principal in such bond during the term of said bond.

property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of
taking appropriate protective measures the permittee shall obtain a license
from the owner of such private property for such purpose and if he cannot
obtain a license from such owner the City Engineer may authorize him to enter
the private premises solely for the purpose of making the property safe. The
permittee shall, at its own expense shore up and protect all buildings, walls,
fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the
excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private
property or highways resulting from its failure properly to protect and carry
out said work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through
any lawn area, the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after
ditches have been back-filled as required in this subchapter. All construction
and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn
area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that
which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove even
temporarily any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas or easements

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 97.37 CARE OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
   All material excavated from trenches and piles adjacent to the trench or in
any street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger
those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that
as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and
adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the City Engineer shall have the authority
to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and
then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the
permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all
necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites.

street but shall use all proper measures to provide for the free passage of
surface water. The permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus
water, muck, silt, slickings or other runoff pumped from excavations or
resulting from sluicing or other operations and shall be responsible for any
damage resulting from its failure to so provide.
('69 Code, § 18-52)
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 97.42 BREAKING THROUGH PAVEMENT; TUNNELS.
   (A)   Whenever it is necessary to break through existing pavement for
excavation purposes and where trenches are to be four feet or over in depth,
the pavement in the base shall be removed to at least six inches beyond the
outer limits of the sub-grade that is to be disturbed in order to prevent
settlement, and a six-inch shoulder of undisturbed material shall be provided
in each side of the excavated trench. The face of the remaining pavement shall
be approximately vertical. A power-driven concrete saw shall be used so as to
permit complete breakage of concrete pavement or base without ragged edges.
Asphalt paving shall be scored or otherwise cut in a straight line. No pile
driver may be used in breaking up the pavement.
('69 Code, § 18-53)

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 97.43 BACKFILLING.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The permittee shall give the City Engineer notice before commencing
any back-filling at an excavation site. If any backfilling is commenced prior
to the time the City Engineer is notified and given an opportunity to inspect
the site, the permittee may be required to remove any or all of said
backfilling if the City Engineer so requires him to do so. When construction
permits are obtained from other regulatory agencies, the City Engineer shall
enforce the prescribed specification stipulated as part of conditions for such
permit in addition to the provisions of this subchapter. In case of conflict
between technical specifications, the City Engineer's decisions shall be final.
      (2)   Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an
excavation permit issued hereunder shall be compacted to a degree equivalent to
that of the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. Compacting shall be
done by the mechanical tappers or vibrators, by rolling in layers, or by water
settling, as required by the soil in question and sound engineering practices
generally recognized in the construction industry. The decision as to whether a
trench shall be backfilled by water-settling shall be based upon such
engineering practices and shall be made by the City Engineer. When water is
taken from a fire hydrant the permittee shall assign one man to operate the
hydrant and shall make certain that said man had been instructed by the Water
Department in the operation of the hydrant. The Water Department shall likewise
be notified at both the beginning and end of the job so that the condition of
the fire hydrants can be checked on both occasions. Any damage done to the
hydrant during the excavation shall be the responsibility of the permittee.
Water shall be paid for by the permittee on the terms agreed upon with the
Water Department.
('69 Code, § 18-55) (Ord. 0-74-3, passed 2-11-74; Am. Ord. 0-78-3, passed 4-10-
78)
   (B)   Backfilling by water settling. When backfilling is done by water
settling, excavated materials above utility installations shall be deposited
uniformly in layers of not more than five feet in thickness and shall be
thoroughly flooded. During the flooding the water shall be allowed to flow
slowly to the trench from high points and shall be worked down to the full
depth of the layer of backfill with bars. All bars used shall be long enough to
extend entirely through the layer being filled and shall be forced down through
the loose backfill material. As the bars are withdrawn the water shall be
allowed to flow downward around the bar. The channel or hole formed by the bar
shall be kept open and the water kept running into it until the fill has
settled. All work shall be done in such manner as to obtain a relative
compaction through the entire depth of the backfill of not less than that
existing adjacent to the excavation.
('69 Code, § 18-56)
   (C)   Dry backfilling. Backfilling up to the first 18 inches above the top
of the utility pipes or similar installations shall be done with thin layers.
Each layer is to be tamped by manual or mechanical means. Layers that are hand
tamped shall not exceed four inches in thickness. Layers that are power tamped
shall not exceed six inches in thickness. The same requirements shall apply to
the remainder of the backfilling if tamping is the method used for backfilling.
Backfilling of all pipes of over 24 inches in diameter shall be carried up to
the spring line of the pipe in three-inch layers, with each layer moistened and
thoroughly tamped with suitable mechanical equipment. The backfill around all
pipes 24 inches or less in diameter shall be flooded or tamped as specified
above to a depth of 18 inches above the top of the pipe before any additional
backfilling is placed thereon.

application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a
new utility pole, the city may propose that the small wireless facility be
collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure
within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept
if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
      (2)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this division.
   (H)   Height limitations.
      (1)   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the
small wireless facility is collocated.
      (2)   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on
which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
         (b)   Forty-five (45) feet above ground level.
   (I)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for
a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which
the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall
apply for a variance in writing with the City Engineer in conformance with
procedures, terms and conditions set forth in §
98.21 of the Galena, Illinois Code of Ordinances.
   (J)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to

granting of such exceptions or variances.
   (L)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
   (M)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.

installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the parkways that characterize
the city's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-

telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and Federal laws, in the event that applicable

(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)
§ 98.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   City review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the City Engineer
within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to
the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations,
the City Engineer shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons
therefor, if the City Engineer is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to
the requirements of this chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the City Engineer shall issue a permit therefor as soon as
practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, that the construction
proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to the Telephone Company Act, ILCS Ch. 220, Act 65, § 4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it intends to commence
work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the city not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work
requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of
work requiring excavation. The City Engineer shall specify the portion of the
right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the City Engineer fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either ten
days after service of notice to the city by the telecommunications retailer in
the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or 25 days after
service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
98.04 the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city an application
for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of division (A) of this section.
   (C)   Additional city review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45 days after
submission to the city, unless otherwise acted upon by the city, provided the
holder has compiled with applicable city codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)
§ 98.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)
§ 98.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
98.21. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall
either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that
it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)
§ 98.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents,
and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in divisions (1)
and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as “X,” “C,” and “U” coverages) and products completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for
each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
   (B)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (C)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (D)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefor from the city.
   (E)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. 
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the city by
registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice addressed to the City Administrator of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no
event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (F)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C), and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self-insurer” under
the Workers Compensation Act.
   (G)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (H)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois
(all insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-” or better
and of a class size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company).
(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)
§ 98.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)
§ 98.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the City Engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities
in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the City Engineer may, in the
exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the
permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal
to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of
this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14-day notice
period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee
shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division (C) of this
section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)

for the revocation or suspension;
         (b)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the city, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the city within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
         (c)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-
of-way to the satisfaction of the city providing written proof of such removal
to the city within ten days after receipt of the written notice of revocation.
      (2)   The city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the
time periods provided in this division.
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of this
section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) of this section, the city or its
designee may, at the option of the city: correct the deficiencies; upon not
less than 20 days notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or
equipment; or after not less than 30 days notice to the permittee of failure to
cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the city. The
permittee shall be liable in all events to the city for all costs of removal.
(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)
§ 98.12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the city no less than
30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-of-way
or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or the
facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former
owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and facilities in
the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the city's right-of-
way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
(Ord. O-17-03, passed 3-14-17)
§ 98.13 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards and principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall
be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,

§ 98.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements, in addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division.
      (1)   No interference with city facilities. No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the City Engineer determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the city's
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the city's utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.

employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their

located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or city approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the city. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

   (B)   Other utilities - tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The city will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis far determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.

necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
city improvement in or upon, or the operations of the city in or upon, the
rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the city, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility's expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way; the utility shad take immediate steps to provide ail necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
City Engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
city police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the city a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after
an emergency repair.
   (D)   Graffiti removal. The utility shall be solely responsible for the cost
of the removal of all graffiti from all of its cable cabinets and other
equipment. If graffiti is not removed after ten days written notice from the
city to the utility, then the city may, but is not obligated, to so remove the
said graffiti. Upon demand by the city to the utility, the city shall be
reimbursed for all costs incurred by the city for said graffiti removal.
   (E)   Reduction in size of cable cabinets. If and when the availability of
the size of the cable cabinets are reduced in size, the utility shall be
required at its sole cost and expense to immediately replace all of its
oversized installed cabinets with a reduced size cabinet.

§ 98.21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the City Engineer as
a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of
this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance
should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The City Engineer shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The City Engineer may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach,
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the City Engineer may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal, any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the City
Engineer under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to
the City Board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The
application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City Clerk within
30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or determination.
The City Board shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the Board's
next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days after the filing
of the appeal. The City Board shall timely decide the appeal.

interest. The City of Galena also recognizes that street performers seek to and
do draw crowds to their performances. This can create safety problems by
impacting the ability of pedestrians to move safely on sidewalks and through
crosswalks and impeding the response time of safety personnel. It can also
impact access to and egress from businesses. This section imposes reasonable
time, place, and manner restrictions on street performers to the extent
necessary to ensure the safety of performers, their audience, and the general
public and to prevent unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of peace and
quiet by residents in their homes or the ability of businesses to operate and
conduct their business.

sidewalk. No performer shall perform on any street or in any public parking
space.
      (3)   To prevent congestion on sidewalks, no performer shall perform less

portion of the crowd that is blocking or obstructing the passage of the public.

a fee for a performance. Voluntary donations may be accepted by performers.
Selling of any items or services is prohibited.
      (9)   Each performer may display a sign at the performance location not
to exceed 12 inches by 18 inches. Signs shall not be located in the street or
in a location to obstruct or block the passage of the public. A sign may
display not more than the name of the performer and the type of performance.
Any street performer sign approved by the city prior to January 1, 2016 shall
be considered grandfathered, but shall not be changed or structurally altered
to prolong the life of the sign. Signs in the National Register Historic

§ 114.01 INTENT
   It is the intent of the City Council to allow vehicle and horse drawn
carriage tours of the community, but to regulate such tours and tour businesses
in a manner that will protect the livability and attractiveness of the
community. The tour business restrictions found herein are necessary for the
following reasons:
   (A)   To recognize that tours and sightseeing-type businesses have a
positive effect on the economic development of the city and help to further
promote the tourism industry;
   (B)   To protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city
by limiting the number of tour vehicles and horse drawn carriages, thereby
easing pollution and assuring adequate pure air, avoiding congestion in the
public streets, and lessening ambient noise levels;
   (C)   To preserve the desirability and livability of residential
neighborhoods by limiting tours through the residential areas of the city;
   (D)   To preserve the property values and protect the health and safety of
the residents of those neighborhoods by limiting tour-related traffic through
the residential areas of the city;
   (E)   To preserve and protect residential streets that were not constructed
or intended for the vehicle loads or additional traffic created by tour
vehicles;
   (F)   To protect the city's investment in pedestrian oriented improvements
by encouraging exploration of the city on foot;
   (G)   To protect pedestrian safety by regulating loading and parking, and
attempting to avoid further traffic congestion in the downtown area; and
   (H)   To protect the historic integrity of an historically important

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 117.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate adult uses to protect the city
from the many types of criminal activity and deleterious effects frequently
associated with such uses. The city recognizes that such regulation cannot in
effect prohibit adult uses. This chapter has balanced the competing interest of
the community in reducing criminal activity, protecting property values and
protecting the unique character of the city versus the rights of the owners,
operators, employees and patrons of adult uses.

§ 130.03 KNOWLEDGE.
   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:

   A person is reckless or acts recklessly, when that person consciously

Penalty, see § 133.99
§ 133.07 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect's escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk,
street, curb, cross-walk, walkway area, mall, or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any
thoroughfare or place open to the public for the purpose of inducing, enticing,
soliciting, or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such action is
consistent with the intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to
commit an act of prostitution are that the person is a known prostitute or
panderer and repeatedly beckons, in the attempt to stop or engage male or
female passersby in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor
vehicles by engaging their operators by hailing, waving of arms, or other
bodily gestures. The violator's conduct must be such as to demonstrate a
specific intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act
of prostitution. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this division
unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain
his or her conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this division if
it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful
purpose.
   (D)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles

      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or

circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the

or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:

§ 151.21 STANDARDS.
   (A)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site
and environment or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.
   (B)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature shall
be prohibited.
   (C)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural features from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
   (D)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its
environment. Those changes that have acquired significance in their own right
shall be retained.
   (E)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
   (F)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of an
architectural feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and where possible materials. Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (G)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting, grinding or other cleaning methods that
will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (H)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigating
measures shall be undertaken.
   (I)   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall
not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy
significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is
compatible with size, color, scale, material, and character of the property,
neighborhood and environment.
   (J)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (K)   The quality of materials and craftsmanship used in a rehabilitation
project must be commensurate with the quality of materials and craftsmanship of
the historic building in question. Certain treatments, if improperly applied,
or certain materials by their physical properties, may cause or accelerate
physical deterioration of historic buildings. Inappropriate physical treatments
include but are not limited to: improper tuckpointing techniques; improper
exterior masonry cleaning methods; or improper introduction of insulation if
damage to historic fabric would result. In almost all situations, use of these
materials and treatments will result in denial of certification. Similarly,
exterior additions that duplicate the form material and detailing of the
structure to the extent that they compromise the historic character of the
structure will result in denial of certification. For further information on
appropriate and inappropriate rehabilitation treatments, owners are to consult
the Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings published by the National
Park Service or contact the City Building Department. 'Preservation Briefs' and
additional technical information to help property owners formulate plans for
the rehabilitation, preservation and continued use of historic properties
consistent with the intent of the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation are
available from the State Historic Preservation Officer, the National Park
Service regional offices and the City Building Department. Owners are
responsible for procuring this material as part of property planning for a
certified rehabilitation.

demolition should be compatible with its original architectural style and
character.

§ 152.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the Storm Water
Detention Regulations of the City of Galena, Illinois.
('69 Code, § 5-18(a)) (Ord. O-83-1, passed 5-9-83)
§ 152.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to eliminate the transportation or movement
of excess storm water and reduce the damage to property and injury to persons
occasioned thereby. Further, it is intended to require that each development
shall provide for the on-site or off-site detention of excess storm water
runoff resulting from that development. For the purpose of this chapter,
“excessive storm water runoff” shall include all increases in storm water
resulting from: an increase in the impervious surface of the site, including
all additions of buildings, roads and parking lots; changes in soil absorption
caused by compaction during development; modifications in contours, including
the filling or draining of small depressional areas, alterations of
drainageways, or regrading of slopes; destruction of forest, alteration of
drainageways or installation of collection systems to intercept street flows or
to replace swales or other drainageways; or, the alteration of subsurface
flows, including any groundwater dewatering or diversion practices such as
curtain drains, compared with the site in its natural state.
('69 Code, § 5-18(b)(1)) (Ord. O-83-1, passed 5-9-83)
§ 152.03 LIMITATION ON STORM WATER RUNOFF.
   No development shall cause downstream property owners, watercourses,
channels or conduits to receive storm water runoff from proposed developments
at a higher peak flow rate than would have resulted from the same storm event
occurring over the site of the proposed development with the land in its
natural, undeveloped condition. For the purposes of this chapter, “undeveloped
condition” shall mean that all the natural retention areas and drainageways
plus existing farm drainage tiles and highway drainage structures shall be
included in the flow calculations. For the purposes of the following
calculation, all ground covers shall be considered to be a meadow or grassland,
with the exception that forested areas shall be treated as woodlands. “Channel”
or “drainage channel” shall mean the channels used to convey the 100-year
drainage flows between successive retention facilities or to retention
facilities or from the property.
('69 Code, § 5-18(b)(2)) (Ord. O-83-1, passed 5-9-83)
§ 152.04 STORAGE CAPACITY.
   All storm water storage facilities shall be designed with sufficient
capacity to accommodate all runoff caused by the development in excess of the
runoff which would have resulted from the site if left in its natural,
undeveloped condition. The storage capacity of all storage facilities shall be
sufficient to store 115% of the excess flow, in each water shed, which would
result from the 100-year storm of 24-hour duration.
('69 Code, § 5-18(b)(3)) (Ord. O-83-1, passed 5-9-83)
§ 152.05 DETENTION STORAGE CALCULATION.
   The following formula shall be used to calculate the volume of detention
required by this chapter:
   V = Rd - Rn - Ros - S - GW
   V = the change in volume (in cubic feet per second) from the site. This is
the base volume of excess storm water flows that would result from the
development.
   Rd = the volume of storm water runoff (in cubic feet per second) flowing
from the site after its development. This determination shall include runoff
from pervious and impervious surfaces, changes in areas of forest, changes in
soils due to compaction, and changes in the time of concentration, for a 100-
year storm of 24-hour duration.
   Rn = the volume of storm water runoff (in cubic feet per second) flowing
from the site in its natural state. This determination shall include runoff
from the site with its natural cover, grassland or woodland for a 100-year
storm of 24-hour duration. Farm fields shall be calculated as grassland.
   Ros = the volume of storm water runoff (in cubic feet per second) flowing
onto the site from upstream properties in their present state of development
for a 100-year flood of 24-hour duration.
   S = the change in capacity (in cubic feet per second) of the natural on-site
detention areas of the site. This indicates any drainageways, small
depressional areas or other areas which would naturally retain water during a
100-year storm of 24-hour duration. (This calculation may carry either a plus
or minus value.)
   GW = the change in subsurface flows due to dewatering techniques which would
add to the total surface water runoff during a 100-year storm of 24-hour
duration. Included here are dewatering devices such as drain tiles, curtain
drains or sump pumps. (This calculation may carry either a plus or minus
value.)
('69 Code, § 5-18(b)(4)) (Ord. O-83-1, passed 5-9-83)
§ 152.06 DESIGN REGULATIONS.
   All detention facilities and improvements required by this chapter shall
comply with the following regulations:
   (A)   Storage volumes. Storage may be provided by wet or dry bottom basins
or reservoirs or roof top storage facilities.
   (B)   Maximum depth. The maximum planned depth of storm water stored shall
not exceed five feet unless natural ground conditions lend themselves to
greater depth.
   (C)   Outlet control structures. Outlet control structures shall be designed
as simply as possible and shall operate automatically. They will be designed to
limit discharges into existing or planned downstream channels or conduits so as
not to exceed existing flow of the site in its natural condition. Perforated
risers of concrete, heavy gauge plastic, or other approved materials shall be
incorporated on inlet piping for the discharge from all storm water detention
basins to allow more gradual discharge of storm water from detention
structures. Stone rip-rap shall be placed at the outlet discharge to break the
force and dissipate the flow. Perforated risers and rip-rap flow reducing
structures shall be designed in accordance with the Illinois Urban Design
Manual.
   (D)   (1)   Spillway. Emergency overflow facilities shall be provided unless
inflow is controlled to divert flows when the basin is at capacity.
      (2)   Buffer space.  All storm water detention basins shall be designed
to provide area downstream of the outlet and alongside the structure to allow
for proper maintenance of the sides and bottom of the berm. There shall be at
least 15 feet of space around the basin to allow a vehicle to reach all parts
of the structure, including the outlet discharge, without encroaching on the
neighboring property.
   (E)   Dry bottom basins. For basins designed without permanent pools.
      (1)   Interior drainage. Provisions must be made to facilitate interior
drainage, to include the provisions of natural grades to outlet structures,
longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage facilities, or the
installation of subsurface drains.
      (2)   Multi-purpose features. These may be designed to serve secondary
purposes for recreation, open space or other types of use which will not be
adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding.
      (3)   Cleaning. The basins shall be designed for periodic cleaning and
removal of sediments, which shall be removed from the site or otherwise
disposed of in an appropriate manner.
   (F)   Wet basins. For basins designed with permanent pools.
      (1)   Depth for fish. If fish are used to help keep the basin clean, at
least one quarter of the area of the permanent pool must have a minimum depth
of ten feet.
      (2)   Facilities for emptying. For emergency purposes, cleaning or
shoreline maintenance, facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for the
use of auxiliary equipment to permit emptying and drainage.
      (3)   Pollution abatement. Aeration facilities may be required when the
quality of the influent and detention time would result in a lowering of
dissolved oxygen content in the basin.
      (4)   Slopes. Approach slopes shall be at least 6:1, but not more than 3:
1 and shall be at least four feet to six feet wide and slope gently toward the
basin. The side slopes shall be of nonerosive material with a slope of 1:1 or
flatter. The ledge shall be four feet to six feet wide and slope gently toward
the shore to prevent people or objects from sliding into deep water. There
shall be a freeboard of 12 inches to 18 inches above the high water elevation
on all retention basins. Alternate designs for side slopes may be considered
under special circumstances where good engineering practice is demonstrated.
      (5)   Cleaning. The basins shall be designed to include sediment traps in
all inlets. Sediment traps shall be designed to permit periodic cleaning and
maintenance. A basin maintenance plan shall be developed to insure that the
design depths of the basin will remain over time.
   (G)   Building regulations.
      (1)   Roof top storage. Detention storage requirements may be met either
in total or in part by detention on flat roofs. Design specifications of such
detention shall be a part of the application for a building permit. These
specifications shall include the depth and volume of storage, design of outlet
devices and down drains, elevation of over-flow scuppers, design loadings for
the roof structure, and emergency over-flow provisions. Roof top storage shall
not be permitted to drain directly into sanitary sewers or streets.
      (2)   Parking lot storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide
temporary detention storage of storm water on a portion of their surfaces not
to exceed 25%. Outlets shall be designed to empty the stored waters slowly and
depths of storage must be limited so as to prevent damage to parked vehicles.
Storage areas shall be posted with warning signs and shall be designed to fill
to maximum depth in not less than two hours.
      (3)   Detention storage. All or a portion of the detention storage may
also be provided in underground detention facilities.
   (H)   Any development which is adjacent to a ravine or ravine buffer and
which has in excess of 3,200 square feet of impervious surface shall provide
evaporative storage to control for a one-inch rainfall on those surfaces.
   (I)   Any development which is adjacent to a ravine or a ravine buffer and
which has an impervious surface ratio in excess of one half shall provide
evaporative or other storage to control for a two-inch rainfall on those
surfaces.
   (J)   Retention in flood plains shall be permitted only in depressional
flood plain areas. Retention will not be permitted in riverine flood plains.
('69 Code, § 5-18(b)(5)) (Ord. O-83-1, passed 5-9-83; Am. Ord. O-03-43, passed
12-8-03)
§ 152.07 EROSION CONTROL.
   (A)   The facilities for the control of storm water runoff shall be
constructed prior to, if possible, the start of any construction or during the
earliest possible stage of construction on the site of the project. All costs
of construction, including the restoring, temporary seeding, and permanent
erosion control measures, shall be borne by the person/persons responsible
therefor. The Building Official shall approve the erosion control measures and
the timing of their installation prior to their accomplishment.
   (B)   The entire storm water storage area shall be designed and constructed
to fully protect the public health, safety and welfare. If a condition occurs
in the storm water storage area which is hazardous to the public health, safety
or welfare, the persons responsible for the condition will be required to
provide approved corrective measures. In the event these measures are not
provided, the city may eliminate the hazard at the expense of the person
responsible.
('69 Code, § 5-18(b)(6),(7)) (Ord. O-83-1, passed 5-9-83)
§ 152.08 SUPERVISION AND INSPECTION.
   (A)   The construction of the storm water storage area and/or storm water
passageway shall be under the supervision of an Illinois registered
professional engineer. He shall be responsible for all construction in
accordance with approved plans.
   (B)   In addition, a registered engineer employed by the city may inspect
all drainage facilities while under construction. When facilities are not
constructed according to approved plans, the city has the explicit authority to
compel compliance and require correction of any situations which are not

redivided or in any manner utilized for the purpose of erecting more than one
principal building or use on such lot or tract of land without subdividing in
accordance with this chapter or by submitting same as a planned unit

recreation facilities, transportation facilities, natural areas and open space,
and related improvements.
   (D)   The City Council, upon recommendation of the Planning Department, may
waive the requirements set forth herein in cases where the subdivision lies

plat and site plans, and make a recommendation to the City Council to approve,
approve with conditions, or deny the preliminary plat. Then the preliminary
plat approval process shall move to the City Council for action in the same
manner as the zoning application.
      (2)   If no zoning action is necessary, the City Council shall hold a
public hearing and provide public notice on the preliminary plat in the same
manner as a zoning application, except that the public hearing shall be held by
the City Council.
      (3)   The City Council shall review and hear all public testimony
regarding the preliminary plat and site plans and move to action at the next
City Council meeting.
   (F)   City Council review and approval.
      (1)   Following review and recommendation by the Zoning Board, or review
of the public hearing held by the City Council, the City Council shall, within
30 days of the Zoning Board action or a public hearing before the Council,
review the preliminary plat and site plans. The City Council shall advise the
applicant of any changes and/or additions to the preliminary plat and
construction plans necessary for approval. The City Council shall then, without
further public hearing, approve, approve with conditions or deny the
preliminary plat. Approval of the application shall authorize the applicant to
prepare and submit the final subdivision plat with corrections and conditions,
if any, required for preliminary plat approval. If the preliminary subdivision
is denied, the City Council shall state specific reasons for denial, and the
applicant shall be provided 60 days to re-submit a revised application without
paying additional fees. In no way is preliminary subdivision approval to serve
as final subdivision approval.
      (2)   Upon Planning Department recommendation, the Council may request to
hold public hearings involving commercial, industrial, mixed-use, and major
subdivision applications jointly with the Zoning Board of Appeals.

be in such amount as is commensurate with the section or sections of the plat
to be filed and may defer the remaining required performance bond principal
amount until the remaining sections of the plat are offered for filing. The
developer may also file irrevocable offers to dedicate streets and public
improvements in the sections offered to be filed and defer filing offers of
dedication for the remaining sections until such sections, subject to any
conditions imposed by the City Council, shall be granted concurrently with
final approval of the plat. In the event of approval of sectionalizing, the
entire approved subdivision plat including all sections shall be filed within
90 days after the date of final approval with the City Clerk and such sections
as have been authorized by the City Council shall be filed with the County
Recorder of Deeds. Such sections shall contain at least 10% of the total number

(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.005 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is adopted for the following general purposes, to:
   (A)   Divide the city and such adjacent unincorporated areas as permitted by
statute into zoning districts and regulating within these the location,
erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, and use of buildings,
structures, and land;
   (B)   Regulate the intensity of the use of lot areas and to control the
areas of open space around such buildings or structures so as to provide
adequate light, air, privacy, convenience of access, and the protection of the
public health;
   (C)   Protect and preserve the character, value, and stability of the
residential, business, industrial, agricultural, and public areas within the
city and such adjacent unincorporated areas as may be permitted by state
statutes, and to promote the orderly and beneficial development of such areas;
   (D)   Prohibit uses, buildings, or structures incompatible with, or
deleterious to the character of development or intended uses within specified
zoning districts;
   (E)   Prevent additions to, and alterations and remodeling of, existing
buildings or structures in such a way as to avoid the restrictions and
limitations lawfully imposed hereunder;
   (F)   Limit congestion of public streets and protect public health, safety,
pedestrian rights, convenience and general welfare by regulating vehicular
parking areas and loading areas;
   (G)   Provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses of land,
building, and structures which are adversely affecting the character, the
intended use, or the value of desirable development as specified for each
district;
   (H)   Designate public areas and land for aesthetic, cultural, and
recreational purposes for the health, welfare, comfort, safety, and enjoyment
of people, conveniently located and easily accessible to residents of all ages;
   (I)   Secure safety from fire, explosives, noxious fumes, panic, and other
dangers in the interest of public health, safety, comfort, and general welfare;
   (J)   Conserve the taxable value of land and buildings throughout the city;
   (K)   Provide penalties for violation of this chapter as may be permitted by
state statutes;
   (L)   Define and limit the powers and duties of the administrative officers
and bodies as provided herein so as to insure the rights of equal treatment,
due process, and the public interest and in accordance with state statutes;
   (M)   Accommodate change while insuring the continuation of the city's
historical character, identity, diversity, and authenticity;
   (N)   Attain the objectives established by the Comprehensive Plan for the
future development of the city;
   (O)   Control flood plain uses such as fill, dumping, storage of materials,
structures, buildings, and any other works which acting alone or in combination
with other existing or future uses will cause damaging flood heights and
velocities by obstructing flows and reducing valley storage;
   (P)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in combination
with similar development, cause flood losses if public streets, sewer, water,
and other utilities must be extended below the flood level to serve the
development;
   (Q)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in combination
with similar development, create an additional burden to the public to pay the
costs of rescue, relief, emergency preparedness measures, sandbagging, pumping,
and temporary dikes or levees; and
   (R)   To insure and facilitate the preservation of sites, areas and
structures of historical, architectural and aesthetic importance.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.006 SEPARABILITY AND NON-LIABILITY.
   It is hereby declared to be the intention of the City Council that the
several provisions of this code are separable in accordance with the following:
   (A)   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge any provision of
this code to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect any other provisions of
this code not specifically included in said judgment.
   (B)   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the
application of any portion of this code to a particular property, water body,
building, or structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said
provision to any other property, water body, building, or structure not
specifically included in said judgment.
   (C)   If any requirement or limitation attached to an authorization given
under this code is found invalid, it shall be presumed that the authorization
would not have been granted without the requirement or limitation and,
therefore, said authorization also shall be invalid.
   (D)   The city does not guarantee, warrant, or represent that only those
areas designated as floodlands will be subject to periodic inundation and
hereby asserts that there is no liability on the part of the city, its
officers, employees, agents, or representatives for any flood damages,
sanitation problems, drainage problems or damages, or structural damages.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.007 ABROGATION.
   It is not intended that this code abrogate or interfere with any
constitutionally protected vested right. It is also not intended that this code
abrogate, repeal, annul, impair or interfere with any existing easements,
covenants, deed restrictions, agreements, rules, regulations or permits
previously adopted or issued pursuant to law.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.008 RULES OF INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this code
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of public
health, safety, morals and welfare, and shall be liberally construed in favor
of the city and shall not be construed to be a limitation or repeal of any
other power now or hereafter possessed by the city.
   (B)   Where property is affected by the regulation imposed by any provision
of this code and by any other governmental regulations, the regulations which
are the most restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements shall
prevail. Regardless of any other provision of this code, no land shall be
developed or used, and no structure erected or maintained in violation of any
state or federal regulations.
   (C)   No structure, land, water or air shall hereafter be used and no
structure or part thereof shall hereafter be located, erected, moved,
reconstructed, extended, enlarged, converted or structurally altered without a
building permit except those specifically exempted by the Building Code and
without full compliance with the provisions of this code and all other
applicable local, county and state requirements.
   (D)   Nothing herein contained shall require any changes in plans,
construction, size or designated use of any building or part thereof, for which
a zoning certificate or building permit has been issued before the effective
date of this code and the construction of which shall have been started within
six months from the date of such permit.
   (E)   Except as provided in §
154.106, under provisions for nonconforming uses, §
154.107 under provisions for nonconforming sites and structures, and §

development or premises shall be hereinafter used or occupied and no applicable
permit granted, that does not conform to the requirements of this code.
   (F)   In cases of mixed-occupancy or mixed-use, the regulations for each
land use shall apply to the portion of the structure or land so occupied or so
used.
   (G)   Except for outlots authorized under
Chapter 153, the city Subdivision Ordinance, to contain permanently protected
green space area, no yard or other open space shall be considered as providing
a yard or open space for a building or structure on any other lot.

§ 154.010 RE-ENACTMENT AND REPEAL.

provisions of the regulations governing zoning and related matters, being
previously known collectively as the "Galena Zoning Ordinance,"
Chapter 154 of the Code of Ordinances for the City of Galena, adopted prior to
the effective date of this code. It is not the intention of this code to
repeal, but rather to re-enact and continue in force such existing provisions
so that all obligations and responsibilities that have accrued thereunder are
preserved and may be enforced, unless explicitly surrendered by specific
provisions of this code or altered by the official zoning map.
   (B)   All provisions of
Chapter 154 which are not re-enacted herein are hereby repealed.
   (C)   The adoption of this code shall not adversely affect the city's right

violation occurred while the ordinance was in effect.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.011 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   All plans approved under previous zoning regulations shall be valid and may
be used to obtain permits for a period of not more that one year after the
effective date of this code, except where subject to the provisions of an
executed development agreement. This code shall become effective upon passage
and publication according to law, following the date of repeal and re-enactment
of the official zoning map.

portion thereof shall automatically be classified in the same zoning district
as the property to which it attaches.

§ 154.105 NONCONFORMING LOT REGULATIONS.
   If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage under common ownership were of record at the time of
passage of this code, and if all of the lots do not meet the requirements
established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to
be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this code, and no portion of said
parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot
width and area requirements established by this code, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this code, except in the following situations:
   (A)   One vacant, nonconforming lot of record, adjacent to and held in
common ownership with a lot occupied by a permitted use, may be used for a
permitted use, not withstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
code, provided that the vacant lot is not more than 10% smaller in area or
width than the average lot size of all developed lots within the block in which
it is located. This provision is intended to apply to single nonconforming lots
located on both sides of a developed lot (a maximum of three contiguous lots).
   (B)   Two vacant lots under the same ownership with continuous frontage
which were of record at the time of passage of this code, and which,
individually, do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area,
may be used individually provided each lot is not less than 90% of the average
width and area of the lots within the block.
   (C)   Any single lot or parcel of land that does not adjoin another lot held
in common ownership, which was of record at the time of adoption of this code,
that does not meet the requirements for minimum lot width and area may be
utilized for a permitted use. With the approval of the Zoning Administrator,
one or more of the bulk standards of the district may be reduced by an amount
proportional to the lot's failure to comply with the minimum width or area
requirements; provided however, that no bulk standard shall be reduced by more
than 25%.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.106 NONCONFORMING USE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Definition. A NONCONFORMING USE is an active and actual use of land or
structures, or both, legally established prior to the effective date of this
code or subsequent applicable amendment thereto that has continued the same use
to the present and that would not be permitted under the current terms of this
code.
   (B)   Continuation. A lawful use made nonconforming by the adoption of this
code of ordinances of the city may continue only for so long as such use
continues unabated subject to the requirements of this section. This section
shall not prohibit normal maintenance or minor repair of any nonconforming use.
   (C)   Non-residential uses. Nonconforming non-residential uses shall be
regulated in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Maintenance.  The normal maintenance of a structure or land
containing or related to a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary
repairs and incidental alterations which do not exacerbate the adverse impacts
of the nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of this code. In no
instance shall said repairs exceed over the life of the structure, 50% of the
present assessed market value of said structure or property prior to said
repairs.
      (2)   Expansion. In all Nonresidential/ Resource Districts, expansion of
up to 20% of the total existing floor area or 20% of any outdoor operations/
storage area may be permitted with an approved site plan review in any
continuous five-year period, provided all other provisions of this code are
met. Expansion of a non-residential use in a Residential District shall be
limited to no more than 10% and only with the approval of a special use permit.
      (3)   Change of use. Any nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use upon. the approval of the Zoning Administrator, provided
that:
         (a)   The proposed use is equally or more appropriate and less
intensive than the existing use, but may not thereafter be returned to the
previous nonconforming use or changed to any more intensive use;
         (b)   The change will not increase congestion in the streets;
         (c)   The change will not endanger the health, safety, morals, or
general welfare of the district in which it is located;
         (d)   The amount of land devoted to the nonconforming use shall not be
increased;
         (e)   The Zoning Administrator may require whatever conditions and
safeguards deemed necessary in granting the change.
         (f)   Any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a
nonconforming use which is changed to or replaced by a use conforming to the
provisions of this code shall not thereafter be used or occupied by a
nonconforming use.
      (4)   Abandonment. A nonconforming use that has been discontinued for a
continuous period of 12 months, for whatever reason, shall be considered to be
abandoned and shall not be re-established. Any further use on the property
shall be in conformance with all applicable provisions of this code. Evidence
of intent to abandon the nonconforming use is not required.
      (5)   Destruction. A nonconforming use damaged to less than 50% of its
fair market value, based on the valuation of the township assessor or a market
appraisal performed by a certified appraiser, may be restored provided that:
all portions of the structure being restored are not and were not on or over a
property line; all construction is in compliance with current construction
codes, such as the Fire and Building Codes; a building permit is obtained
within six months from the date of the damage; and the certificate of occupancy
(or other final inspection) is issued within one year of the issuance of the
building permit. If damage exceeds 50% or more of the fair market value,
restoration or improvement shall not be permitted unless the restoration
results in a use conforming to all applicable provisions of this code.
   (D)   Residential uses.  Nonconforming residential uses shall be regulated
in accordance with the following provisions. As used in this paragraph,
nonconforming residential uses are those uses which are nonconforming due to
the number of dwelling units they contain or their location in a zoning
district that does not permit residential uses.
      (1)   Maintenance. The normal maintenance of a structure or land
containing or related to a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary
repairs and incidental alterations which do not exacerbate the adverse impacts
of the nonconforming use in relation to the purpose of this code.
      (2)   Expansion. In all zoning districts, nonconforming single-family
homes may expand by the greater of either 20% of the existing gross floor area
or 20% of the value of the existing structure, based on the valuation of the
township assessor or a market appraisal performed by a certified appraiser, in
any continuous five-year period provided that: an addition of up to 150 square
feet shall be permitted regardless of existing size or value of the structure;
no additional dwelling units are created; and all other provisions of this code
are met. Expansion of residential structures other than single family homes
shall be strictly limited to common areas only and limited to 300 square feet
in any continuous five-year period.
      (3)   Abandonment. A nonconforming residential use, other than a single-
family home, that has not been occupied for a continuous period of 12 months,
for whatever reason, shall be considered to be abandoned and shall not be
reoccupied. Any further use on the property shall be in conformance with all
applicable provisions of this code. Evidence of intent to abandon the
nonconforming use is not required.
         (a)   A nonconforming single-family home that has not been occupied
for a continuous period 12 months or longer shall not be considered to be
abandoned and may be reoccupied at any time provided the structure has not been
changed, legally or illegally, to a non-residential use or multiple-unit
residential use.
         (b)   Removal of a nonconforming mobile home or manufactured home not
in a mobile home park from its foundation or pad for a continuous period of 12
months shall constitute abandonment of the use and placement of a new unit must
comply with the provisions of this code. Evidence of intent to abandon the
nonconforming mobile home or manufactured home use is not required.
         (c)   Failure to correct code violations that have been adjudicated
and so ordered in the manner and time frame so ordered shall constitute intent
to abandon a nonconforming residential use.
      (4)   Destruction. Nonconforming residential uses that are damaged may be
rebuilt in accordance with the following:
         (a)   A structure damaged to less than 50% of its fair market value,
based on the valuation of the township assessor or a market appraisal performed
by a certified appraiser, may be restored provided that: all portions of the
structure being restored are not and were not on or over a property line; the
number of dwelling units does not increase; all construction is in compliance
with current construction codes, such as the Fire and Building Codes; a
building permit is obtained within six months from the date of the damage; and
the certificate of occupancy (or other final inspection) is issued within one
year of the issuance of the building permit.
         (b)   A structure damaged to 50% or greater of its fair market value,
based on the valuation of the township assessor or a market appraisal performed
by a certified appraiser, may be rebuilt to its existing number of units
provided that: the units were legally created at the time they were built; all
portions of the structure being restored are not and were not on or over a
property line; the number of dwelling units does not increase; the structure
and property are in compliance with all other regulations of this code, other
than the number of units; all construction is in compliance with current
construction codes, such as the Fire and Building Codes; a building permit is
obtained within six months from the date of the damage; and the certificate of
occupancy (or other final inspection) is issued within one year of the issuance
of the building permit.
      (5)   Density acceptance. Owners who are unable to prove to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator that the density (number of units) on
their property was legally established may appeal to the Zoning Board of
Appeals to be granted rebuilding rights under this section. In deciding such
appeals, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing and consider
the following: any and all documentation available regarding the development
history of the property, both permitted and unpermitted; the number, type and
disposition of code violations and criminal infractions on the property; the
length of time the current owner has had the property and whether the density
or violations preceded that ownership; the degree of nonconformity of density;
the number and extent of any site nonconformities; and the potential impact
granting indefinite rebuilding rights would have on surrounding properties and
the neighborhood in general. Notice of the hearing shall be provided in the
same manner as required for a variance before the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (6)   Rebuilding. All structures damaged to 50% or greater of their fair
market value that are reconstructed, shall comply with all provisions of this
code, other than density, including, but not limited to: setbacks, building
height, parking, landscaping and open space. Although the property shall retain
the right to re-establish the same number of dwelling units, changes may be
required to the size and type of units and the configuration of the structure
(s) in order to meet other code requirements. If the property does not conform
to all requirements of this code, other than density, approval of a special use
permit shall be required in order to vary from the requirements. In addition to
complying with the special use permit criteria, the applicant shall demonstrate
that the proposed redevelopment of the property complies with the code
requirements to the maximum extent practical given that it is the intent of
this code that the property is permitted to retain its density and remain
viable.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.107 NONCONFORMING SITES AND STRUCTURES REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Definition. NONCONFORMING SITES AND STRUCTURES are those that do not
meet one or more of the bulk standards applicable to the site or structure, or
one or more of the site improvement and performance standards contained in §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713.
   (B)   Continuation. A lawfully created structure or parcel of land existing
as of the effective date of this code that is nonconforming due solely to
failure to meet the bulk standards of the zoning district or the site
improvement and performance standards of §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713 may be used for any purposes permitted in the zoning district so long
as the use is in conformance with the provisions of this section.
   (C)   Maintenance and restoration. In any continuous 12-month period,
interior and exterior  remodeling of a nonconforming structure that requires a
building permit shall require correction of existing on-site improvements that
do not conform to the requirements of §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713, in accordance with this section. The cost of the remodeling shall be
as shown on the approved building permit application and the current fair
market value of the existing structure shall be based on a market appraisal
performed by a certified appraiser or as determined by the township assessor.
      (1)   Remodeling projects that cost 25% or less of the current fair
market value of the structure shall not require any correction of existing
conditions that fail to meet the requirements of §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713, other than as may be required by Fire and Building Codes.
      (2)   Remodeling projects that cost more than 25%, but less than 75% of
the current fair market value of the structure shall require a corresponding
percentage increase in compliance with the requirements of §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713, until the site achieves 100% compliance.
(For example, if a site has only 2,000 sq. ft. of the 3,000 sq. ft. of required
landscape area and the cost of the remodeling is 30% of the value of the
building, then 30% of the required landscape area shall be added, or 900 sq.
ft.)
      (3)   Remodeling projects that cost 75% or greater of the current fair
market value of the structure shall require 100% compliance with the
requirements of §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713.
      (4)   Remodeling projects of any size shall not require changes in the
number of parking spaces, except as provided in §
154.601.
      (5)   Properties that are physically constrained from complying with
these provisions shall comply to the maximum extent practicable as determined
by the Zoning Administrator.
      (D)   Expansion. In any continuous five-year period, additions to
structures on nonconforming sites shall require correction of existing on-site
improvements that do not conform to the requirements of §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713.
      (1)   Expansions that would result in less than a 35% increase of the
total gross square footage of the existing structure(s) shall require a
corresponding percentage increase in compliance with the requirements of §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713 until the site achieves 100% compliance. The same requirements also
shall apply to the addition of new or increased areas for outdoor operations/
storage. (For example, if the addition is 20% of the size of the existing
building and the site contains only 50% of the required landscaping, 20% of the
required landscaping for the entire site must be provided thereby bringing the
site to 70% of the total required.)
      (2)   Complete replacement of existing structures or expansions that
result in a 35% or greater increase of the total gross square footage of the
existing structure(s) require the entire property to meet all of the
requirements of §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713. The same requirements also shall apply to the addition of new or
increased areas for outdoor operations/storage.
      (3)   Expansions that necessitate an increase in the number of parking
spaces shall be required to provide 100% of the required parking spaces for the
use in accordance with §§
154.601 through
154.605 and
154.701 through
154.713. The additional parking area shall comply with all associated
landscaping and drainage requirements of this code.
      (4)   Structures with wall lines that fail to meet the setbacks
established in this code may be expanded horizontally or vertically at the
existing setback dimension provided that the setback dimension is 75% or
greater of the required setback and all other applicable bulk standards are
met.
   (E)   Change of use. Changes of use that necessitate an increase in the
number of parking spaces shall be required to provide additional parking
spaces, as per §
154.601, where space on the lot is available.
   (F)   Destruction. A nonconforming structure which is damaged to 50% or less
of its fair market value, based on a valuation of the township assessor or a
market appraisal performed by a certified appraiser, may be restored within the
existing footprint provided that: all portions of the structure being restored
are not and were not on or over a property line; all construction is in
compliance with current construction codes, such as the Fire and Building
Codes; a building permit is obtained within six months from the date of the
damage; and the certificate of occupancy (or other final inspection) is issued
within one year of the issuance of the building permit. If damage exceeds 50%,
restoration or improvement shall not be permitted unless the restoration
results in a structure and site conforming to all applicable requirements of
this code.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.108 NONCONFORMING USE, SITES AND STRUCTURES TIME EXTENSIONS.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals may permit one extension of up to 12 additional
months to the time periods for abandonment, obtaining a building permit, and/or
completing construction provided the applicant can demonstrate circumstances
out of his control have prevented a good faith attempt to re-establish or
rebuild the nonconforming use and/or structure. Such circumstances may include
the health of the applicant, court proceedings, failure to reach an insurance
settlement, acts of God, or similar hardships.

§ 154.109 VARIANCES FOR NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, SITES AND STRUCTURES.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals may vary the provisions of this section.
Application and processing shall be in accordance with the provisions of §
154.925.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.110 NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, SITES AND STRUCTURES EVIDENCE OF STATUS.
   The nonconforming regulations of this subchapter apply only to legally
established, nonconforming lots, uses, sites or structures, and evidence of the
legal status of a nonconforming lot, use, site or structure shall be supplied
by the owner of the property upon request of the Zoning Administrator. Owners
who fail to present sufficient evidence that the lot, use, site, or structure
was legally established under a previous code may be denied the rights and
privileges granted by this subchapter and may be subjected to enforcement
proceedings by the city in order to obtain full compliance with this code.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
STANDARD ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 154.201 STANDARD ZONING DISTRICTS AND STANDARD ZONING DISTRICT CATEGORIES.
   For the purpose of this code, all areas within the jurisdiction of this code
are hereby divided into standard zoning districts, as shown in
Table 154.201.1. The categories are listed in increasing order of intensity.
Likewise, the districts within the categories are also listed in increasing
order of intensity.
   (A)   Conservation Districts.
      (1)   Limited Agricultural (LA) District. This district is intended to
permit development of a highly rural community character. The land use
standards for this district permit extremely low density single-family
residential development at a density of one dwelling unit for every 35 gross
acres, as well as a limited variety of agricultural and agricultural support
land uses. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to
ensure that development which requires even a minimum of urban services does
not occur until such services are available. As such, the Limited Agricultural
(LA) District shall either serve as a designation which preserves and protects
agricultural activities indefinitely, or as a "holding zone" which provides for
an interim land use (agriculture) that will easily permit further development
(with rezoning to another district) at the appropriate time.
      (2)   Floodway District. Refer to
Chapter 155, Floodplain Management Standards.
      (3)   Flood Fringe Overlay District.  Refer to § 155.004 regarding
regulating development in floodplain areas.
   (B)   Residential Districts.
      (1)   Countryside Residential (CSR) District. This district is intended
to permit development which has a countryside community character. Unlike the
case for the Limited Agricultural (LA) District, the land use standards for
this district permit primarily single-family detached residential development
and a variety of related institutional land uses, and are not oriented to a
wide range of agricultural activities. Density and intensity standards for this
district are designed with the assumption that urban services (particularly
sewer and water) will not be made available and that such facilities will be
provided on-site. The Countryside Residential (CSR) District shall serve as a
designation which preserves and protects the countryside community character of
its area while serving as a transition between highly rural agricultural areas
and more developed urban areas. A variety of residential development options
are available in this district, with a maximum gross density (MGD) of one
dwelling unit for every five gross acres for conventional development or one
dwelling unit for every two and one-half gross acres for cluster development.
This district is generally mapped in areas of low agricultural production/
potential but where the extension of urban services would be difficult and not
cost-effective.
      (2)   Low Density Residential (LDR) District. This district is intended
to permit development which primarily has a detached, single-family community
character. Density and intensity standards for this district are designed to
ensure that the Low Density Residential (LDR) District shall serve as a
designation which preserves and protects the residential community character of
its area. Residential development with a maximum gross density (MGD) of seven
dwelling units per gross acre is available within this district.
      (3)   Medium Density Residential (MDR) District. This district is
intended to permit development which has a medium density community character.
The land use standards for this district permit single-family detached homes,
twin-houses and duplexes by right and related institutional land uses. Density
and intensity standards for this district are designed to ensure that the
Medium Density Residential (MDR) District shall serve as a designation which
preserves and protects the community character of its area. A variety of
residential development options are available in this district, with a maximum
gross density (MGD) of nine and one-half dwelling units per gross acre.
      (4)   High Density Residential (HDR) District. This district is intended
to permit development which has a high density community character. The land
use standards for this district permit single-family detached homes, twin
houses, duplexes, two flats, townhouses, multiplexes, and apartments permitted
by right and related institutional land uses. Density and intensity standards
for this district are designed to ensure that the High Density Residential
(HDR) District shall serve as a designation which preserves and protects the
community character of its area. A variety of residential development options
are available in this district, with a maximum gross density (MGD) of 16
dwelling units per gross acre.
   (C)   Nonresidential Districts.
      (1)   Neighborhood Office (NO) District. This district is intended to
permit high quality office, institutional, and residential land uses at an
intensity compatible with the older portions of the city predominately
developed with large homes which are desirable to maintain, where traffic
volumes and adjacent land uses dictate the transition of these areas to certain
nonresidential uses. The desired neighborhood character of the development is
attained through landscape surface area ratio (LSR) requirements, and by
restricting the maximum building size (MBS).
      (2)   Planned Office (PO) District. This district is intended to permit
high quality office and institutional land uses at an intensity compatible with
the overall community character of the city. Significant areas of landscaping
are required in this district to ensure that this effect is achieved. In order
to ensure a minimum of disruption to adjacent residential development, no
development within this district shall take direct access to a local
residential street or a residential collector street.
      (3)   Neighborhood Commercial (NC) District. This district is intended to
permit small-scale commercial development which is compatible with the desired
overall neighborhood community character of the area in general, and with
adjacent residential development in particular. The desired neighborhood
community character of the development is attained through landscape surface
area ratio (LSR) requirements, and by restricting the maximum building size
(MBS). Significant areas of landscaping are required in this district to ensure
that this effect is achieved.
      (4)   Planned Commercial (PC) District.  This district is intended to
permit large- and small-scale commercial development which is compatible with
an overall high quality community character, particularly along the Highway 20
corridor. Accordingly, the district standards are crafted to work in
conjunction with the requirements of the Highway 20 Corridor Overlay District,
§
154.303. A wide range of office, retail, and service land uses are permitted
within this district, but with extremely limited outdoor activities and
operations. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to adjacent residential
development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a
local residential street or a residential collector street.
      (5)   General Commercial (GC) District. This district is intended to
permit both large- and small-scale commercial development at intensities which
provide significant incentives for infill and new development. To accomplish
this effect, the minimum required landscaped surface area ratio (LSR) is lower
than that required in the Planned Commercial District. A wide range of office,
retail, and entertainment land uses are permitted within this district,
including those with outdoor activities. In order to ensure a minimum of
disruption to adjacent residential development, no development within this
district shall take direct access to a local residential street or a
residential collector street.
      (6)   Downtown Commercial (DC) District. This district is intended to
permit both large- and small-scale downtown commercial development at an
intensity which provides significant incentives for infill development,
redevelopment, and the continued economic viability of existing development.
Accordingly, the district standards are crafted to work in conjunction with the
requirements of the Historic District set forth in
Chapter 151. A wide range of office, retail, and lodging land uses are
permitted within this district. Consistent with existing development patterns,
no requirements for on-site landscaping or parking are required in this
district for permitted uses. This district is strictly limited to the central
city.
      (7)   Planned Industrial (PI) District.  This district is intended to
permit both large- and small-scale industrial, research and development, and
office at an intensity which is consistent with the overall desired character
of the community. Beyond a relatively high minimum landscape area ratio (LSR),
the primary distinguishing feature of this district is that it is geared to
indoor activities which are not typically associated with high levels of noise,
soot, odors and other potential nuisances for adjoining properties. In order to
ensure a minimum of disruption to adjacent residential development, no
development within this district shall take direct access to a local
residential street or a residential collector street.
      (8)   Light Industrial (LI) District. This district is intended to permit
both large- and small-scale industrial and office development at an intensity
which is consistent with existing transition and urban intensity development.
The primary distinguishing feature of this district is that it is geared to
indoor industrial activities which are not typically associated with high
levels of noise, soot, odors and other potential nuisances for adjoining
properties. To ensure a minimum of disruption to adjacent residential
development, no development within this district shall take direct access to a
local residential street or a residential collector street.
      (9)   Heavy Industrial (HI) District. This district is intended to permit
both large- and small-scale industrial and office development at an intensity
which provides ample incentive for infill and new development. This district is
designed to permit a very wide variety of industrial uses which may occur both
indoors and outdoors, including certain land uses which are permitted in no
other zoning district because of their potential to create nuisances for
adjoining properties. In order to ensure a minimum of disruption to adjacent
residential development, no development within this district shall take direct
access to a local residential street or a residential collector street.

ALTERNATIVE ZONING DISTRICTS
§ 154.301 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zone applies to mixed-use
and unique single-use projects where design flexibility is desired and is not
available through applications of the standard zoning districts established in
§§
154.201 through
154.209. Planned unit development zoning should be used only when long-term
community benefits, which may be achieved through high quality planned
development, will be derived. Specific benefits that would support a PUD zoning
include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   More efficient infrastructure;
      (2)   Reduced traffic demands;
      (3)   A greater quality and quantity of public and/or private open space;
      (4)   Other recreational amenities;
      (5)   Needed housing types and/or mix;
      (6)   Innovative designs; and/or
      (7)   Protection and/or preservation of natural resources.
   (B)   Default standards. The use, bulk, development, improvement and other
standards for each planned unit development shall be derived from one or more
of the standard zoning districts which are most similar in terms of permitted
uses, density, and intensity to the proposed uses within the development. In a
planned unit development context, those standards shall be referred to as
default standards or default zone. The PUD shall be consistent with the default
zone upon which the planned unit development is based. Deviations from any of
the default standards may be approved only as provided in this section and
shall be explicitly stated in the zoning/rezoning ordinance. The planned unit
development ordinance shall contain a provision that if the planned unit
development approval expires or becomes invalid for any reason, the property
shall be fully subject to the default standards.
   (C)   Establishment of uses.
      (1)   Uses allowed. At the time of zoning a parcel to PUD, the City
Council shall determine the allowed uses. Only uses consistent in type and
density with the adopted Comprehensive Plan may be allowed within a PUD. The
type and density of allowed uses should generally be limited to uses allowed in
the default zoning, except as noted herein.
      (2)   Adoption and modification of authorized uses. The City Council, at
the time of establishing a PUD zone, shall list uses that are authorized by
right or by special use permit. All uses, whether by right or special use
permit, shall be subject to all applicable permit and approval processes
established in this code.
   (D)   Development standards. Planned unit developments shall minimally
comply with the development standards of the default zone and all other
applicable code provisions, except when the City Council specifically finds
that a standard or standards should not be applied.
      (1)   Residential density. Dwelling unit densities in a planned unit
development shall comply with the maximum densities of the Comprehensive Plan
or default zone.
      (2)   Nonresidential intensity. Nonresidential planned unit development
intensity shall be established as a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) and maximum
building size (MBS) at the time of planned unit development rezoning approval.
In determining the maximum FAR and MBS, the Zoning Board of Appeals and City
Council shall consider:
         (a)   The intensity of adjacent development;
         (b)   The demand for and/or mix of residential and nonresidential
development in the proposed PUD and in the vicinity of the proposed PUD;
         (c)   The availability of transportation facilities; including
streets, parking, transit facilities and bicycle/pedestrian facilities;
         (d)   The adequacy of utilities and public services; and
         (e)   The maximum FAR permitted in the default zone.
      (3)   Mixed use intensity.
         (a)   Mixed use developments in areas designated for residential
development in the adopted Comprehensive Plan shall not exceed the plan density
minus one dwelling unit per 1,000 square feet of nonresidential development or
portion thereof within the development. In mixed use developments, no more than
20% of the land area may be dedicated to nonresidential uses.
         (b)   The maximum residential densities within mixed use developments
designated for nonresidential development in the Comprehensive Plan shall not
exceed 20 dwelling units per acre, minus one dwelling unit per 2,000 square
feet of nonresidential development or portion thereof. In such developments,
residential uses shall not constitute more than 50% of total floor area.
      (4)   Development standards. A PUD shall meet the development standards
of the default zone or the following, whichever is more restrictive. Exceptions
may be allowed only in accordance with this section.
         (a)    Setback standards. Principal structure setbacks shall not be
less than the minimum setbacks for the default zone unless the applicant can
demonstrate that:
            1.   Buildings can be safely designed and that the design is
compatible with lesser setbacks. Compatibility shall be evaluated under the
city Building and Fire Codes and any other applicable life, health or safety
codes;
            2.   Reduced setbacks are offset by increased screening or primary
recreation facilities in private or common open space;
            3.   Reduction of setbacks is required for protection of natural
resources.
         (b)   Open space.  All residential planned developments shall comply
with the minimum open space and landscape surface area standards of the default
zone.
         (c)   Compatibility. Nonresidential construction shall be compatible
with adjacent residential development.
         (d)   Landscaping. Landscaping shall meet or exceed the requirements
of §§
154.601 through
154.605.
         (e)   Parking. Off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with
§§
154.601 through
154.605.
         (f)   Street development standards. Street, alleys and sidewalks shall
be designed and constructed in accordance with
Chapter 153, Subdivision Regulations, and other applicable city standards.
         (g)   Stormwater management. Stormwater within the PUD shall be
managed within the PUD according to the following principles and requirements:
            1.   Comply with all state regulations associated with stormwater
management, including the Illinois Administrative Code, and any city stormwater
management ordinance;
            2.   Comply with regional stormwater management plans adopted by
the city;
            3.   Minimize off-site stormwater runoff;
            4.   Promote on-site filtration;
            5.   Utilize natural stormwater management systems wherever
practical;
            6.   Utilize stormwater management Best Management Practices, as
articulated in the Illinois Administrative Code and other professional
publications;
            7.   Minimize the discharge of pollutants to ground and surface
water; and
            8.   Maintain and protect natural topography and existing land
cover to the extent reasonably practicable.
      (5)   Deviation from development default standards. The Zoning Board of
Appeals may recommend that the City Council deviate from the default district
standards subject to the provision of any of the community amenities listed
below. In order for the Zoning Board of Appeals to recommend, and the City
Council to approve, a deviation from the default district standards, the listed
amenities shall be provided in excess of what would otherwise be required by
this code. These amenities include:
         (a)   Transportation amenities including but not limited to: off-
street trails, bike and pedestrian amenities, or transit oriented improvements,
including school and transit bus shelters;
         (b)   Open space, agricultural land reservations, or land dedication
of 20% or greater;
         (c)   Community facilities or provision of public services beyond
those required for development within the PUD;
         (d)   The provision of affordable housing for moderate, low and very
low income households pursuant to HUD definitions for no less than 15 years;
         (e)   The provision of innovative infiltration or filtration
techniques such as permeable pavements, rain gardens, bioswales, French drains,
or other low impact development methods such as roof gardens, rainwater
harvesting systems, open water features, and vegetative buffers; and
         (f)   The provision of Green Building Code compliant structures or
improved efficiency site lighting; and
         (g)   Other amenities, in excess of the minimum standards required by
this code, that the City Council specifically finds provide sufficient
community benefit to offset the proposed deviation.
   (E)   PUD types. §
154.923 provides the procedures and review criteria for all PUD's. These apply
to the following types of planned unit developments:
      (1)   Planned Unit Development District. Under a planned unit development
district, a comprehensive set of development standards are approved that apply
to a lot or a subdivision, as opposed to a specific site plan showing building
footprints. In addition to including comparable standards to the default
district, the PUD district also includes standards for perimeter landscaping
and buffering, vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and other standards as
necessary to ensure that future development will be of an intensity and quality
as represented by the applicant and envisioned by the City Council. Typically,
planned unit development districts are approved for larger developments, which
include several different types of uses that are expected to be built over a
long period of time. A minimum of five acres shall be required for a planned
unit development unless the Zoning Board of Appeals recommends, and the City
Council finds, that a smaller site is appropriate for the development or
redevelopment as a PUD. In approving a planned unit development smaller than
five acres, the Zoning Board of Appeals and City Council shall find that the
proposed development:
         (a)   Cannot be developed under conventional zoning;
         (b)   Is adequately buffered from adjacent residential property;
         (c)   Mitigates adverse impacts on adjacent properties; and
         (d)   Is consistent with the goals and policies of the adopted
Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   Planned unit development site. Under a planned unit development
site, a detailed site plan showing building footprints, setbacks, parking areas
and other details is approved, with which all future development must comply.
At the time of planned unit development approval, standards for future building
additions or minor modifications may be included, but generally the approved
site plan controls all development on the lot indefinitely. Typically, planned
unit developments, which include a small number of buildings that are expected
to be built shortly after PUD approval.
   (F)   PUD stages. The two PUD types described in division (E) above, may be
approved in the following three stages:
      (1)   Outline development plan. An outline development plan (ODP) is an
optional but encouraged first step prior to an application for a preliminary
development plan for a parcel of at least 20 acres. The purpose of an ODP is to
demonstrate conformance with the adopted Comprehensive Plan, compatibility of
land use and coordination of improvements within and among individually platted
parcels, sections or phases of a development prior to the approval of a
preliminary plan. At ODP, the proposed zoning for the entire property or for
each pod designated for development on the plan is established. This step is
recommended for larger, more diverse projects that are expected to be developed
over a long period of time. Through this process, the general pattern of
development is established with a range of densities and intensities assigned
to individual pods that will be the subject of future, more detailed planning.
         (a)   Controlling document. All subsequent preliminary and final plans
and all future development on the property shall be consistent with the
approved ODP.
         (b)   Required information. Detailed application requirements for ODP
approval are provided in §
154.923. At a minimum, plans and information submitted at this stage shall
include:
            1.   A conceptual ("bubble") plan drawing of the general land use
layout and the general location of major public streets and/or private drives.
            2.   A general written description of the proposed PUD including:
               a.   General project themes and images;
               b.   The general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses;
               c.   Approximate residential densities and nonresidential
intensities as described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio, maximum
building size and impervious surface area ratio;
               d.   The underlying zoning district(s) for the PUD;
               e.   The general treatment of natural features;
               f.   The general relationship to nearby properties and public
streets;
               g.   The general relationship of the project to the adopted
Comprehensive Plan;
               h.   An initial draft of density and intensity, bulk,
landscaping, and parking and loading standards for the development.
               i.   A development phasing schedule.
      (2)   Preliminary plan.
         (a)   Approved ODP. If the property has an approved ODP, the purpose
of the preliminary development plan is to ensure consistency with the uses,
density/intensity, bulk, performance, and other standards of the approved ODP
and proposed PUD rezoning ordinance for the specific area included in the
preliminary plan. Unless specified otherwise with the ODP, the applicant shall
have the option of proposing either a planned unit development district or
planned unit development site. Typically, the PUD rezoning ordinance is acted
upon at this stage concurrent with action on the planned unit development
district or site. However, should the City Council find that a proposed
preliminary plan lacks sufficient detail to ensure that future development will
be of the intensity and quality proposed by the applicant and as envisioned by
the City Council, it may defer action on the PUD rezoning ordinance until the
final plan stage.
         (b)   No approved ODP.  If the property does not have an approved ODP,
the purpose of this stage is to answer the question, "Should this use, with
this specific intensity/density, designed in this particular manner, be
constructed on this site?" In designing the plan, the applicant shall have the
option of proposing either a planned unit development district or planned unit
development site. Typically, the PUD rezoning ordinance is acted upon at this
stage concurrent with action on the preliminary plan. However, should the City
Council find that a proposed planned unit development district or site lacks
sufficient detail to ensure that future development will be of the intensity
and quality proposed by the applicant and as envisioned by the City Council, it
may defer action on the PUD rezoning ordinance until the final plan stage.
         (c)   Controlling document. All subsequent final plans and all future
development on the property shall be consistent with the approved preliminary
plan.
         (d)   Required information. Detailed application requirements for
preliminary plan approval are provided in §
154.923. At a minimum, plans and information submitted at this stage shall
include:
            1.   A location map of the subject property and its vicinity, using
the city's proposed land use map from the adopted Comprehensive Plan as a base;
            2.   A site inventory and analysis map with topography at two foot
contours to identify site assets, resources, and constraints, including, but
not limited to, floodplains, wetlands, soils with limitations for building
development, utility easements, slopes greater than 12%, and existing trees
over eight inches in diameter or the edges of woodlands in which a majority of
trees meet this criteria;
            3.   A conceptual site plan or neighborhood development plan, at a
scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet, which indicates existing and
proposed major public streets, private drives, and paths; different land use
areas by proposed type and density; and proposed recreational, open space, and
generalized stormwater management areas and facilities;
            4.   An analysis or map showing the general locaiions of proposed
public utility connections, and anticipated upgrades to public utilities to
serve the planned development;
            5.   A conceptual landscape plan showing general locations and
types of proposed landscaping, including maintenance of existing vegetation
where appropriate;
            6.   A phasing plan, where applicable;
            7.   A conceptual stormwater management plan identifying the
proposed patterns of major stormwater run-off, locations of stormwater
infiltration areas, and other significant stormwater management features,
including relationships to and alignment with any regional stormwater
management plan adopted by the city;
            8.   Typical proposed building elevations identifying the
architectural style of each of the different use areas, along with a general
program for proposed signage;
            9.   A written report that provides general information about the
site conditions; project themes and images; development objectives; mix of uses
and dwelling unit types; approximate residential densities and non-residential
development intensities; and the relationship of the project to adjacent land
uses, the city's adopted Comprehensive Plan and other applicable adopted city
plans, and the purpose and criteria for PUDs included in this section.
      (3)   Final plan. The final development plan and final subdivision plat,
where applicable, act as the blueprint for development of a PUD project. The
plan and the plat ensure consistency with the approved preliminary development
plan and specific development and construction requirements of various adopted
city codes. The PUD rezoning ordinance is acted upon at this stage concurrent
with action on the final plan if it was not acted upon at the time of
preliminary plan approval. A final plan may include all or only a portion of
the area of the entire PUD, consistent with the development phasing schedule
approved with the preliminary plan.
         (a)   Required information. Detailed application requirements for
final plan approval are provided in §
154.923. At a minimum, plans and information submitted at this stage shall
include:
            1.   A final plan drawing of the proposed project showing at least
the following information in sufficient detail to make an evaluation against
the criteria for approval contained in §
154.923;
               a.   For a proposed planned unit development district, a final
site plan conforming to all the requirements of §
154.914;
               b.   For a proposed planned unit development site, a final
subdivision plan conforming to all the requirements of
Chapter 153, Subdivision Regulations;
               c.   Location of recreational and open space areas and
facilities, specifically describing those that are to be reserved or dedicated
for public acquisition and use;
               d.   Statistical data on minimum lot sizes in the development,
the precise areas of all development lots and pads, density/intensity of
various parts of the development, floor area ratio, maximum building size,
impervious surface area ratio and landscape surface area ratio of various land
uses, expected staging, and any other plans required by the Zoning Board of
Appeals or City Council; and
               e.   Notations relating the written information required in
division (F)(3)(a)5. below, to specific areas on the final plan drawing.
            2.   Where applicable, a landscaping plan for the subject property
specifying the location, species, and installed size of all trees and shrubs.
This plan shall also include a chart that provides a cumulative total for each
species, type and required location (perimeter, foundation, yard, street, paved
area or bufferyard) of all trees and shrubs.
            3.   Where applicable, a series of building elevations for the
entire exterior of all buildings in the PUD site, including detailed notes as
to the materials and colors proposed.
            4.   Where applicable, a general signage plan for the project,
including all project identification signs, concepts for public fixtures and
signs (such as street light fixtures and/or poles or street sign faces and/or
poles), and signage themes which are proposed to vary from city standards or
common practices.
             5.   A written description of the proposed final plan that
demonstrates the full consistency of the proposed final plan with the approved
preliminary plan.

§ 154.302 TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND) zoning
district is intended to allow desirable and innovative development activities
and variation in the relationship of uses, structures and open spaces in
developments conceived and implemented as cohesive, unified projects. This
alternative zoning district is intended to promote development and
redevelopment of land consistent with the following traditional neighborhood
design principles:
      (1)   An environment that promotes human interaction, a healthy civic
life, a sense of place, and a high-quality living environment;
      (2)   Compact and reflects the character of historic development patterns
in the city;
      (3)   Designed for the human scale (sizes of buildings in proportion to
sizes of people) and for walkability (comfort, ease, and quickness of moving on
foot from one point to another);
      (4)   Provides a mix of uses, including residential, commercial, civic,
and open space uses in close proximity to one another, along with a vertical
mixing of uses in multi-story buildings; .
      (5)   Provides a mix of housing styles, types, and sizes to accommodate
households of all ages, sizes, and incomes;
      (6)   Includes a minimum of five acres in gross land area to accommodate
a mix of uses;
      (6)   Incorporates a system of interconnected streets with sidewalks and
paths that offer multiple routes for motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists
within and through the neighborhood;
      (7)   Retains, to the extent reasonably practical, existing buildings
with historical or architectural features that enhance the visual character of
the community;
      (8)   Incorporates significant environmental features into the design;
and
      (9)   Consistent with the city's adopted Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Allowable uses. In a TND District, any use that is permitted by right
or as a special use, accessory use, or temporary use in any of the standard
zoning districts in this chapter, or mix of uses, may be permitted subject to
the criteria listed below. All traditional neighborhood development specific
implementation plans shall specify the range of proposed and approved uses in
that particular TND, and shall include a carefully planned and integrated mix
of residential use areas, a mixed-use area, and open space areas as provided
below:
      (1)   Two or more of the following residential use areas:
         (a)   Single-family detached dwellings.
         (b)   Single-family attached dwellings, including duplexes,
townhouses, and row houses.
         (c)   Multi-family dwellings, including senior housing.
         (d)   Special needs housing, including community living arrangements
and assisted living facilities.
      (2)   At least one mixed use area.  At least 90% of the residences within
the TND shall be within one-quarter mile from a mixed-use area within or
outside of the project. The total gross land area of nonresidential development
uses, including off-street parking areas, shall not exceed 25% of the area of
the entire TND. A mixed use area within the TND shall include a mix of two or
more of the following uses:
         (a)   Commercial uses, such as services, retail, restaurants, and
accommodations. Individual businesses shall not exceed 5,000 square feet each
in ground floor area.
         (b)   Attached residential dwellings, including single-family
attached, multi-family, second-story residential units, live/work units, and
special needs housing.
         (c)   Civic or institutional uses, such as municipal offices,
libraries, post offices, places of worship, day care centers, and educational
facilities.
      (3)   At least one common open space area. At least 15% of the gross land
area of the TND must remain as permanently protected common open space.
Permanently protected common open space areas include public parks,
environmental corridors, trails, protected natural areas, and private parks
that are permanently restricted from non-recreational development, but do not
include private yards or stormwater management basins or conveyance channels.
Small neighborhood parks, playgrounds, and squares should be integrated into
the development, while large outdoor recreation areas should generally be
located at the periphery. At least 90% of the residences within the TND shall
be within mile from a protected common open space area.
   (C)   Dimensional requirements. Any lot, building, yard, density, or other
dimensional requirements approved by the city as part of a TND preliminary or
final plan shall be construed to be and enforced as part of this chapter. Lot
area, width, and yard requirements shall also conform to the following
criteria:
      (1)   Minimum lot area and width. A variety of lot sizes shall be
provided to facilitate housing choice and meet the requirements of people with
different housing needs. Minimum lot areas and widths shall be as follows:
         (a)   Single-family detached dwellings:
            1. Front-loaded/side-loaded. Minimum lot area shall be 5,000 square
feet. Minimum lot width shall be 50 feet with an attached garage and 40 feet
with a detached garage.
            2.   Rear-loaded. Minimum lot area shall be 4,500 square feet.
Minimum lot width shall be 45 feet with an attached garage and 40 feet with a
detached garage.
            3.   A special use permit will be required if the total building
coverage of a new or remodeled single-family detached dwelling, including the
garage, exceeds 80% of the area of any individual lot within a TND District.
            4.   Dwellings within condominium developments shall be subject to
similar density standards.
         (b)   Single-family attached dwellings, including duplexes,
townhouses, and row houses:
            1.   Duplexes. Minimum lot area shall be 3,500 square feet per
dwelling unit. Minimum lot width shall be 30 feet per dwelling unit.
            2.   Row houses and townhomes. Minimum lot area shall be 2,200
square feet per dwelling unit. Minimum lot width shall be 22 feet per dwelling
unit.
            3.   Dwellings within condominium developments shall be subject to
similar density standards.
         (c)   Multi-family dwellings, including senior housing. Minimum lot
area shall be 700 square feet for each efficiency dwelling unit, with an
additional 300 square feet of lot area required for each additional bedroom in
the dwelling unit.
         (d)   Minimum lot areas and widths for all other uses shall be as
specified in the submitted TND project plans.
      (2)   Block size. Street layouts shall provide for perimeter blocks that
are a maximum of 400 feet deep and 800 feet long.
      (3)   Yard requirements and building setbacks. See
Table 154.302.1.
 
TABLE 154.302.1 BUILDING SETBACKS

Mixed Use Areas   15 feet (1)                10 feet (1)
Footnotes:
(1)   Minimum building separation standards shall substitute for required
side and rear lot setbacks.
 
   (D)   Circulation and parking requirements. The circulation system shall
allow for different modes of transportation, provide functional and visual
links among the residential areas, mixed-use area, and open space areas within
the TND; connect to existing and proposed development outside the TND; provide
adequate traffic capacity; provide connected pedestrian and bicycle routes
including off-street paths or bicycle lanes on streets; control through
traffic; limit direct lot access on streets with higher expected traffic
volumes; and promote safe and efficient mobility. More specific design
standards that shall be met are as follows:
      (1)   Pedestrian circulation. Convenient and continuous pedestrian
circulation systems, including walkways and paths, that minimize pedestrian-
motor vehicle conflicts shall be provided throughout the TND. Where feasible,
any existing pedestrian routes through the site shall be preserved, enhanced,
or relocated if necessary. All streets, except for alleys, shall be bordered by
sidewalks on both sides in accordance with the specifications listed in
Table 154.302.2. Clear and well-lighted walkways shall connect entrances for
multi-family residential and non-residential buildings to the adjacent public
sidewalk and to associated parking areas. Intersections of sidewalks with
streets shall be designed with clearly defined edges. Crosswalks shall be well
lit and clearly marked with contrasting paving materials at the edges, raised
pavement, or striping. Curb bulb-outs, median refuges, and other related
techniques should also be incorporated along collector streets and at key
intersections to shorten the pedestrian-crossing distance. Between-lot walkways
or paths may be required where necessary to maintain the continuity of the
pedestrian circulation system.
      (2)   Bicycle circulation. Facilities for bicycle travel shall be
included in the project, and may include off-street bicycle paths (generally
shared with pedestrians and other non-motorized users), separate striped,
bicycle lanes on streets per
Table 154.302.2, signed bicycle routes, or some combination. Any existing
bicycle routes through the site shall be preserved, enhanced, or relocated if
necessary. Selected bicycle routes and facilities shall implement the
recommendations in the city's comprehensive plan. All businesses, civic uses,
and multi-family residences shall provide adequate bicycle parking areas and
facilities.
      (3)   Motor vehicle circulation.  Motor vehicle circulation shall be
designed to efficiently move motor vehicle traffic via multiple routes and to
minimize conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Traffic calming features such
as curb extensions, traffic circles, medians, and on-street parking are
encouraged to slow traffic speeds. Arterial streets should generally not bisect
a TND. Collector streets within the TND are intended to carry traffic from
minor streets to arterial streets, include the principal entrance street to a
residential development component, and may be subject to access controls. Minor
streets are intended to be used primarily for access to abutting properties,
and are usually not subject to access controls. Alleys are special public ways
affording secondary access to the rear of abutting properties. Minimum street
design standards for a TND shall be in accordance with
Table 154.302.2, Figures
154.302.1 and
154.302.2.
      (4)   Street layout. The TND shall maintain the existing street grid,
where present, and restore any disrupted street grid where feasible. The
orientation of streets shall enhance the visual impact of common open spaces
and prominent buildings, create lots that facilitate passive solar design,
minimize street gradients, and minimize the use of double frontage lots. All
streets shall extend through the development or terminate at other streets,
except minor streets may temporarily "dead end" when such streets will connect
to future phases or other sites outside the TND and may permanently terminate
in a cul-de-sac only where necessary due to topography and where there will be
a through connection via a pedestrian way or bicycle path at the end.
      (5)   Parking and loading requirements.  All TNDs shall meet the parking
and loading requirements found in §§
154.601 through
154.605, except that the city may allow adjacent on-street parking within a TND
to apply toward the minimum parking requirements. For multi-family buildings
and in the required mixed-use area, shared use parking lots are encouraged,
off-street parking lots may not be adjacent to or opposite from a street
intersection, and parking lots shall be located to the rear or sides of
buildings. The edges of parking lots, "islands," and all other areas not used
for parking or vehicular circulation shall be landscaped and curbed,
particularly where the parking lot is located to the side of a building.
Parking lots containing more than 30 spaces shall be broken up into smaller
pods with not more than 30 spaces each, with the pods separated from another by
landscaped areas or buildings. Site plans shall provide a direct route to
service or loading dock areas, while minimizing the movement of loading
vehicles through parking areas. Reduction of impervious surfaces through the
use of pervious pavement and interlocking pavers is encouraged, particularly
for remote parking lots and parking areas for periodic uses.

two-sided parking. (bottom)
   (E)   Other site and neighborhood design requirements.
      (1)   Stormwater management.  Stormwater within the TND shall be managed
within the TND according to the following principles and requirements:
         (a)   Comply with all state regulations associated with stormwater
management, including the Illinois Administrative Code, and any city stormwater
management ordinance;
         (b)   Comply with regional stormwater management plans adopted by the
city;
         (c)   Minimize off-site stormwater runoff;
         (d)   Promote on-site filtration;
         (e)   Utilize natural stormwater management systems wherever
practical;
         (f)   Utilize stormwater management Best Management Practices, as
articulated in the Illinois Administrative Code and other professional
publications;
         (g)   Minimize the discharge of pollutants to ground and surface
water; and
         (h)   Maintain and protect natural topography and existing land cover
to the extent reasonably practicable.
      (2)   Exterior lighting and utilities. The styles of proposed street and
private lot lighting shall be compatible with one another. All exterior
lighting within the TND shall meet the technical lighting requirements of the
Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, or any city lighting
ordinance if more restrictive. Street lighting shall be provided on both sides
of all streets at intervals of no greater than 75 feet. More, smaller street
lights as opposed to fewer, higher intensity lights, should be used. All new
public and private utility installations shall be underground.
      (3)   On-site landscaping and screening. Overall composition and location
of landscaping shall complement the scale of the development and its
surroundings. In general, larger, well-placed contiguous planting areas shall
be preferred to smaller, disconnected areas. Plants native to the region are
encouraged. More specific landscape standards that shall be met are included in
§§
154.601 through
154.605.
      (4)   Street trees. An average minimum of one deciduous tree per 50 feet
of public street frontage shall be required. Street tree placements may be
clustered or adjusted to achieve a particular design objective or account for
traffic visibility, curb openings, street lighting, and other obstructions.
Street trees shall generally be located between the sidewalk and the curb and
within the landscaped area of a boulevard. If placement of street trees within
the right-of-way will interfere with pre-existing utility lines, trees may be
planted within the private street yard adjacent to the sidewalk.
   (F)   Architectural and signage requirements.  A variety of architectural
features and building materials is encouraged to give each building or group of
buildings a distinct character, while maintaining a compatible design theme
throughout the TND. More specific design standards that shall be met are as
follows:
      (1)   Existing structures. Existing structures, if determined to be
historic, architecturally, or culturally significant, shall be protected from
demolition or encroachment by incompatible structures or land development, to
the extent reasonably practical and as controlled by the city's historic
preservation program.
      (2)   New structures.
         (a)   Height. New structures within a TND shall be no more than one
and one-half stories for single-family detached dwellings and attached
dwellings, and four stories for commercial, multi-family, or mixed-use
buildings. Buildings within the mixed use area shall additionally meet the
standards depicted in
Figure 154.302.3.
         (b)   Entries and facades. Similar architectural features, materials,
and the articulation of a building facade shall be continued on all sides
visible from a public street. The front facade of the principal building shall
face onto the street yard of a public street, and not directly toward a parking
lot. As buildings are moved closer to the street and to each other, special
attention should be paid to design details and landscaping. Compatible building
designs shall be followed for new structures on opposite sides of the same
street. Porches, roof overhangs, hooded front doors or other similar
architectural elements shall define the front entrance to all residences. For
nonresidential buildings, a minimum of 50% of the public street facade(s) on
the ground floor shall be transparent, consisting of window or door openings.
Figure 154.302.3.    Schematic elevation sketch of a typical mixed use area
“streetscape.” To create a visually unified “streetwall,” buildings shall be no
more than 30% taller or 30% shorter than the average building height on the
block within the mixed use area.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7243.jpg]
 
         (b)   Garages. Garages accessed from the public street, where garage
doors face a public street, shall occupy no more than 50% of the front facade
of the house. Residential garages shall either be set back a minimum of four
feet to the rear of the main front facade of the dwelling structure (not
including porches or other projections) or utilize side-entry layout and set
back two feet from the front facade to ensure that the garage does not dominate
the view from the street. These standards are illustrated in
Figure 154.302.4. Varied garage setbacks along alleysare encouraged to create a
more interesting streetscape and avoid cramped, monotonous, and claustrophobic
alleys.
      (3)   Signage. Business signs, entrance monuments, and other major signs
within a TND shall share a common or compatible style, which may be
demonstrated by similarities in sizes, shapes, and/or materials. In addition,
all signage shall meet the technical requirements of §§
154.801 through 154.815, except that the maximum height of a freestanding sign
shall be eight feet and the maximum area of a freestanding sign shall be 50
square feet.

required.
c) Detached garage, behind the house, is accessed from a street
d) Detached garage is accessed from an alley
   (G)   Modifications and changes.  The GDP or PIP approval may include any
aspect of project flexibility requested by the applicant, including but not
limited to options for different uses and densities within the TND. Any
subsequent change of use of any parcel of land or addition or modification of
any approved development plan beyond such approved flexible aspects shall be
submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals for approval. Minor changes that do
not affect the intent of the GDP or PIP may be granted by the Zoning Board of
Appeals. Major changes that involve changes to the general intent of the
project as expressed in the approved GDP shall be made by the City Council,
following the same process as required for the original GDP approval.
   (H)   TND stages. Traditional neighborhood developments may be approved in
the following stages:
      (1)   Outline development plan. An outline development plan (ODP) is an
optional but encouraged first step prior to an application for a preliminary
development plan for a parcel of at least 20 acres. The purpose of an ODP is to
demonstrate conformance with the TND development standards, compatibility of
land use and coordination of improvements within and among individually platted
parcels, sections or phases of a development prior to the approval of a
preliminary plan. At ODP, the proposed intensity and density of development for
the entire property or for each pod designated for development on the plan is
established. This step is recommended for larger, more diverse projects that
are expected to be developed over a long period of time. Through this process,
the general pattern of development is established with a range of densities and
intensities assigned to individual pods that will be the subject of future,
more detailed planning.
         (a)   Controlling document. All subsequent preliminary and final plans
and all future development on the property shall be consistent with the
approved ODP.
         (b)   Required information. Detailed application requirements for ODP
approval are provided in §
154.923. At a minimum, plans and information submitted at this stage shall
include:
            1.   A conceptual ("bubble") plan drawing of the general land use
layout and the general location of major public streets and/or private drives.
            2.   A general written description of the proposed TND including:
               a.   General project themes and images;
               b.   The general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses;
               c.   Approximate residential densities and nonresidential
intensities as described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio, maximum
building size and impervious surface area ratio;
               d.   The general treatment of natural features;
               e.   The general relationship to nearby properties and public
streets;
               f.   The general relationship of the project to the adopted
Comprehensive Plan;
               g.   An initial draft of density and intensity, bulk,
landscaping, and parking and loading standards for the development.
               h.   A development phasing schedule.
      (2)   General development plan (GDP). A general development plan (GDP)
application shall be submitted to and approved by the City Council following a
recommendation by the Zoning Board of Appeals. The GDP application shall
include the following:
         (a)   Controlling document. All subsequent preliminary and final plans
and all future development on the property shall be consistent with the
approved GDP.
         (b)   Required information. Detailed application requirements for GDP
approval are provided in §
154.923. At a minimum plans and information submitted at this stage shall
include:
            1.   A location map of the subject property and its vicinity, using
the city's proposed land use map from the adopted Comprehensive Plan as a base;
            2.   A site inventory and analysis map with topography at two foot
contours to identify site assets, resources, and constraints, including, but
not limited to, floodplains, wetlands, soils with limitations for building
development, utility easements, slopes greater than 12%, and existing trees

areas by proposed type and density; and proposed recreational, open space, and
generalized stormwater management areas and facilities;
            4.   An analysis or map showing the general locations of proposed
public utility connections, and anticipated upgrades to public utilities to
serve the planned development;
            5.   A conceptual landscape plan showing general locations and
types of proposed landscaping, including maintenance of existing vegetation
where appropriate;
            6.   A phasing plan, where applicable;
            7.   A conceptual stormwater management plan identifying the
proposed patterns of major stormwater run-off, locations of stormwater
infiltration areas, and other significant stormwater management features,
including relationships to and alignment with any regional stormwater
management plan adopted by the city;
            8.   Typical proposed building elevations identifying the
architectural style of each of the different use areas, along with a general
program for proposed signage;
            9.   A written report that provides general information about the
site conditions; project themes and images; development objectives; mix of uses
and dwelling unit types; approximate residential densities and nonresidential
development intensities; and the relationship of the project to adjacent land

LAND USE REGULATIONS
§ 154.401 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to indicate which land uses may locate in
each zoning district and under what requirements; and which land uses may not
locate therein. A further distinction is made for land uses which may locate in
a given district only upon obtaining a special or temporary use permit to do
so. Finally, certain land uses may locate in a given district as a matter of
right upon compliance with special regulations for such a land use.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.402 INTERPRETATION OF LAND USE TABLES.

Ch. 153
§ 154.406 DETAILED LAND USE DESCRIPTIONS AND REGULATIONS.
   The land use categories employed by this chapter are defined in this
section. Land uses which are not listed in this chapter are not necessarily
excluded from locating within any given zoning district. Section
154.903 empowers the Zoning Administrator to make interpretations on matters
regarding specific land use proposals which are not addressed by this chapter.
   (A)   Principal residential land uses.
      (1)   Single-family detached. A dwelling designed for and occupied by not
more than one family and having no roof, wall, or floor in common with any
other dwelling unit. This dwelling unit type consists of a fully detached
single-family residence which is located on an individual lot or within a group
development. The dwelling unit must be a site-built structure built in
compliance with the city Building Code, or may be a manufactured dwelling
(modular home) as permitted by the city Building Code or a manufactured home as
permitted by the HUD code. For any of these dwelling units, the use of a
permanent, continuous city Building Code specified foundation is required. This
dwelling unit type may not be split into two or more residences.
      (2)   Cluster neighborhood development. A type of single-family
residential subdivision intended to preserve open space, farmland, and natural
features that define, sustain, and connect rural neighborhoods and enhance the
rural character around the city; hide or buffer development from public roads
through placement, topography, vegetation, and/or setbacks; and encourage
housing on moderately sized rural lots clustered in portions of the property
best suited for development. As permitted in certain residential zoning
districts (see
Table 154.403.1), the cluster neighborhood development option allows for
reductions from normal minimum lot size requirements in exchange for compliance
with conservation neighborhood design principles described through the
following regulations. The reduced minimum lot size standards are indicated on
Table 154.207.1 for each district in which cluster development is permitted.
         (a)   Regulations:
            1.   The subdivider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Board of Appeals that he or she has followed the steps in the design of
conservation neighborhood developments included in this division.
            2.   Natural resources shall be integrated into the subdivision
design as aesthetic and conservation landscape elements. The subdivision shall
identify and provide for the permanent preservation of environmentally
sensitive areas such as wetlands, hydric soils, floodplains, slopes of 15% or
greater, areas of rare or endangered plant or animal species, or historic and
archaeological sites. Permanent preservation shall be achieved through the
implementation of techniques such as conservation easements, restrictive
covenants, deed restrictions, dedication to the public or an appropriate non-
profit organization, and/or establishment of buildable or "no build" areas on
the plat.
            3.   Where the subdivision includes mature woodland, the subdivider
shall identify the edges of said woodland and provide for the preservation of a
substantial percentage of the woodland canopy area unless the Zoning Board of
Appeals determines this standard to be impractical. During the process of
subdivision review and development, no grading, tree removal, or home building
shall occur within such woodland.
            4.   Where the subdivision includes prime farmland soils, and such
soils have been cultivated within the previous five years, the subdivider shall
identify and provide for the preservation of such farmland to the extent
practical.
            5.   The subdivision shall provide for the recreational needs of
its future residents through trails, parks, dog runs, or other passive
recreational space or facilities geared and accessible to residents. Where an
adopted city or county comprehensive plan, land use plan, or outdoor recreation
plan recommends a park, trail, or other recreational facility for the proposed
plat area, the sub-divider shall make reasonable accommodation for the
recommended facility. Common open space shall be protected by legal
arrangements satisfactory to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
            6.   A minimum landscape surface ratio of 50% (of gross site area)
shall be located within permanently preserved natural areas, common
recreational areas, and or farmland, not including any lands required for
public dedication under
Chapter 153, Subdivision Regulations, or any lands within lots platted as
homesites.
            7.   Lots, dwellings, and internal roads shall be placed to
minimize their visibility from existing public roads and to conform to the
landscape. This shall be accomplished by:
               a.   Designing lots with frontage on a federal, state, or county
highway so the dwellings will face away from the highway, with deep lots and a
landscaped bufferyard along the highway.
               b.   Designing roads and lot layouts to blend with the natural
land contours.
               c.   Using topography and existing vegetation to screen
dwellings to the extent practical.
               d.   Minimizing dwellings in open fields and on exposed hilltops
and ridgelines.
               e.   Preserving tree lines, fence lines, stone rows, existing
farm roads, barns, cabins, and other features of the rural landscape to the
extent practical.
            8.   The subdivision shall include stormwater management systems
that focus on Best Management Practices (BMPs). BMPs may include overland water
transfer, natural landscape planting and restoration to increase infiltration
and reduce runoff, bioinfiltration systems, natural basin design, residential
roof runoff directed to yard areas, and rain gardens. Such techniques shall be
integrated in a stormwater management and erosion control plan submitted with
the conditional use permit application.
         9.   The subdivision shall provide an acceptable sewage treatment and/
or disposal system meeting the requirements of all applicable county and state
regulations.
      (3)   Zero lot line. A zero lot line development is comprised of
detached, single family homes where the area (side yards) between the homes is
reserved for use by only one of the homes, thereby providing for greater use
and enjoyment of the side yard area. Each house is on a separate platted lot or
condominium. In the case of platted lots, each home is located five feet from
each side property line as necessary to comply with all fire and building code
requirements regarding building separation. However, on one side of the home a
five-foot easement is created running the entire depth of the lot. Under the
provisions of the easement, the neighboring (receiving) property is granted
full use rights of the area, and the granting property maintains limited use
rights as needed only for maintenance and emergency access. In the case of a
condominium, one of the homes is granted exclusive use of the area between the
homes, with exceptions for maintenance and emergency access to the other home.
To enhance the privacy of the receiving property in using the easement area, no
windows or doors typically are located on the adjoining wall of the home of the
granting property. This dwelling may not be split into two or more residences.
The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for a zero lot line
home is three spaces, including garage, drives, and all designated parking
surfaces.
      (4)   Twin-house. This dwelling unit type consists of a single-family
dwelling which is attached on one side to another single-family dwelling. A

between each dwelling unit. The two residences shall be located on individual
lots or recorded as individual condominium units. The twin- house is
distinguished from the duplex house merely by having each unit located on an
individual lot or within a group development. These dwelling unit types may not
be split into additional residences.
      (5)   Duplex. This dwelling unit type consists of a single-family
dwelling which is attached on one side to another single-family residence. A
minimum city Building Code required fire-rated wall assembly division,
separating living areas from the lowest level to flush against the underside of
the roof, and individual sanitary sewer and public water laterals are required
between each dwelling unit. The two residences are located on a single lot. The
duplex is distinguished from a twin-house merely by having both units located
on a single lot. The dwelling unit type may not be split into additional
residences.
      (6)   Two-flat house.  This dwelling unit type consists of a single-
family residence, which is in complete compliance with the city Building Code
for one-and two-family dwellings, which has been built as or converted into a
two-family residence. The two residences may be attached horizontally or
vertically and are both located on the same lot or within the same group
development. This dwelling unit type may not be split into additional
residences.
         (a)   Regulations: In the MDR District, each unit shall have a
separate, exterior entrance.
      (7)   Townhouse. This dwelling unit type consists of attached, one- or
two-story, single-family residences, each having a private, individual access.
This dwelling unit type is located on its own lot or within a group development
and may not be split into additional residences. A minimum city Building Code
required fire rated wall assembly division, separating living areas from the
lowest level through the roof, and individual sanitary sewer and public water
laterals are required between each dwelling unit.
         (a)   Regulations: In the MDR District, no more than four townhouse
dwellings may be attached.
      (8)   Multiplex. This dwelling unit type consists of three or more
attached dwelling units, each of which has a private, individual exterior
entrance. A minimum city Building Code required fire-rated wall assembly
division, separating living areas from the lowest level through the roof, is
required between each dwelling unit.
         (a)   Regulations: In the MDR District, no more than 4 dwellings shall
be attached.
      (9)   Multiple-family. This dwelling unit type consists of three or more
dwelling units, each of which takes access from a shared entrance or hallway. A
minimum city Building Code required fire-rated wall assembly division,
separating living areas from the lowest level to the underside of the roof, is
required between each dwelling unit.
      (10)   Mobile home. This dwelling unit type consists of a fully detached,
single-family residence, which has not received a Federal Manufactured Housing
Certificate and which is located on an individual lot or within a group
development. This dwelling unit type may not be split into two or more
residences.

the effective date of this chapter). Clear cutting is permitted only as a
special use within the jurisdiction of this chapter. Areas which have been
clear cut as a result of intentional action following the effective date of
this chapter without the granting of a special use permit are in violation of
this chapter. The property owner may be fined for such violation (in accordance
with the this code of ordinances) and shall be required to implement the
mitigation standards required for the destruction of woodlands solely at his/
her expense, including costs associated with site inspection to confirm the
satisfaction of mitigation requirements. Areas which have been clear cut

bufferyard or landscaped area (see §
154.404).
      (7)   Intensive agriculture. Intensive agricultural land uses include all
operations primarily oriented to the on-site raising and/or use of animals at
an intensity equal to or exceeding one animal unit (as defined in §
154.015) per acre and/or agricultural activities requiring large investments in
structures. Examples of such land uses include feed lots, hog farms, poultry
operations, fish farms, and certain other operations meeting this criterion.

      (6)   Sales and service, in-vehicle. In-vehicle sales and service land
uses include all land uses which perform sales and/or services to persons in
vehicles, or to vehicles which may or may not be occupied at the time of such
activity (except vehicle repair and maintenance services, see division (D)(16)
below). Such land uses often have traffic volumes which exhibit their highest
levels concurrent with peak traffic flows on adjacent roads. Examples of such
land uses include drive-in, drive-up, and drive-through facilities, vehicular
fuel stations, and all forms of car washes. If performed in conjunction with a
principal land use (for example, a convenience store, restaurant or bank), in-
vehicle sales and service land uses shall be considered an accessory use. (See
§
154.402(C))
         (a)   Regulations:
            1.   Clearly marked pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided for
each walk-in customer access to the facility adjacent to the drive-through lane
(s).
            2.   The drive-through facility shall be designed so as to not
impede or impair vehicular and pedestrian traffic movement, or exacerbate the
potential for pedestrian/vehicular conflicts.
            3.   In no instance shall a drive-through facility be permitted to
operate which endangers the public safety, even if such land use has been
permitted under the provisions of this section.
            4.   The setback of any overhead canopy or similar structure shall
be a minimum of 10 feet from all street rights-of-way lines, a minimum of 20
feet from all residentially-zoned property lines, and shall be a minimum of 10

similar structure shall not exceed 20 feet as measured to highest part of
structure.

paved with concrete or bituminous material which is designed to meet the
requirements of a minimum 4-ton axle load.

a non-mountable design. No curb protecting an exterior fixture shall be located
closer than 25 feet to all property lines.

overhead canopy or other accessory structure shall be considered a freestanding
sign subject to regulation under §§
154.801 through 154.815.
      (7)   Public accommodations, bed and breakfast.  A bed and breakfast
shall have a maximum of five bedrooms for guests. A bed and breakfast must be a
single-family dwelling, except as otherwise noted in this section, and have
historic and/or architectural significance of sufficient merit to qualify as a
place that would be clearly attractive to guests. A structure used for this
purpose must have been in existence as of 1900. A bed and breakfast shall
afford to its guests an opportunity to visit with the owner and other guests in
a home-like environment. It is the intention of the city to restrict the number
of bed and breakfasts and to encourage the use of single-family dwellings for
residential purposes in order to maintain the integrity of residential
neighborhoods. Therefore, no one owner may own or operate more than one bed and
breakfast. A special use permit to operate a bed and breakfast shall not be
granted for a building detached from the owner occupied principal residence, or
for a building on a lot contiguous thereto, within any residential district.
         (a)   Regulations:
            1.   House size.  It is the intention of the city that bed and
breakfasts be limited to larger homes whereby a special use would benefit the
city and surrounding area by allowing an appropriate adaptive use for such
dwellings. This is in recognition that the expense of owning and maintaining
larger historic homes has made them less suitable for single-family dwellings
than they once were.
            2.   Original bedrooms. The number of original bedrooms indigenous
to a particular house will be considered.
            3.   Lot capacity. The capacity of a particular zoning lot to
absorb the impact of a bed and breakfast operation shall be considered and
consideration shall be given to usable lot size, topography, existing
vegetation, parking requirements, the location of the bed and breakfast on the
lot and the proximity of the bed and breakfast to neighboring houses in
determining the number of guest rooms to be permitted in a bed and breakfast.
            4.   Availability and impact of parking. The availability of on-
street and off-street parking shall be considered. The physical and aesthetic
impact of off-street parking located on the lot shall not be detrimental to the
existing character of the lot and the surrounding neighborhood. It shall be a
priority to preserve green space. Generally, the capacity of a lot to
accommodate off-street parking shall be related to the size and nature of the
lot, as stated in (D)(7)(a)3. above. Rental of parking spaces on property other
than the lot of the bed and breakfast shall not be allowed.
(For further requirements, refer to (D)(7)(b) below.)
            5.   Criteria guiding the determination of number of guest rooms
permissible in a bed and breakfast. Refer to Table

            8.   Existing nonconforming situations. Property owners granted
special use permits for bed and breakfasts prior to August 1, 1989, and their
heirs and assigns, shall only be required to meet bed and breakfast zoning
requirements in force at the time the bed and breakfast special use permit was
initially granted provided the bed and breakfasts meet all city licensing
requirements, comply with all laws of the state, and satisfy divisions (D)(7)
(a)6.c. and (D)(7)(a)7.d. above.
         (b)   Parking requirements. One space for each bed and breakfast,
sleeping room or suite, plus one additional space for the owner; however,
parking requirements may be partially satisfied by permitting on-street parking
along the frontage of the lot on which the bed and breakfast is located, unless
such would have a negative impact on the site or immediate neighborhood of the
site. (Refer to §
154.601(H)(3)(a) and
Table 154.601.3.)
      (8)   Public accommodations, small inn. A building, or portion thereof

on-premise and meals may or may not be served.
         (a)   Regulations:
            1.   Building size. It is the intention of the city that small inns
be limited to larger existing historic structures. Such structures shall
include larger residential structures, structures that were originally
constructed to provide public accommodations or other nonresidential
structures, whereby a special use would benefit the city and surrounding area
by allowing an appropriate adaptive use for such structures. This is in
recognition of the expense of owning and maintaining larger historic
structures.
            2.   Number of guestrooms. In the case of structures originally
constructed as a residence or to provide public accommodations, the number of
original bedrooms indigenous to a particular structure will be considered. In
the case of other nonresidential structures, the number of guest rooms will be

in the city’s adopted Building Codes, Life Safety and Fire Codes, Electrical
Code, the Americans with Disabilities Act and any other codes of the city.
            3.   Lot capacity.  The capacity of a particular lot to absorb the
impact of a small inn operation shall be considered and consideration shall be

small inn to neighboring properties in determining the number of guest rooms to
be permitted in a small inn.

having a private bathroom. Such land uses may provide in-room or in-suite
kitchens, and may also provide indoor recreational facilities for the exclusive
use of their customers. Restaurant, arcades, fitness centers, and other on-site
facilities available to non-lodgers are not considered accessory uses and
therefore require review as a separate land use.

         (b)   NOTE: The incorporation of this subsection into this chapter is
designed to reflect the City Council's official finding that adult
entertainment land uses have a predominant tendency to produce certain
undesirable secondary effects on the surrounding community, as has been
demonstrated in other, similar jurisdictions. Specifically, the City Council is
concerned with the potential for such uses to limit: the attractiveness of
nearby locations for new development, the ability to attract and/or retain
customers, and the ability to market and sell nearby properties at a level
consistent with similar properties not located near such facilities. It is
explicitly not the intent of this subsection to suppress free expression by
unreasonably limiting alternative avenues of communication, but rather to
balance the need to protect free expression opportunities with the need to
implement the city's Comprehensive Plan and protect the character and integrity
of its commercial and residential neighborhoods.
         (c)   Location of adult entertainment establishments:
            1.   The location shall conform to ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 11-1.5, as

         (d)   Standards of measurement. The distances provided in this
subsection shall be measured in a straight line without regard to intervening

§ 154.407 GROUP DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)    Definition. A GROUP DEVELOPMENT is any development containing:
      (1)   Any single structure on a single lot which contains 17 or more
dwelling units or 10 or more nonresidential uses; and/or,
      (2)   Any single structure that requires special use approval as per §
154.924 due to its size. Common examples of group developments include
apartment buildings, apartment complexes, condominium complexes, strip centers,
shopping centers, and office centers.
   (B)   Permitted by right. Not applicable.
   (C)   Special use regulations. Any land use that is permitted as a permitted
by right land use or as a special use within the applicable zoning district(s)
is permitted to locate within a group development. The detailed land use
regulations of this division that pertain to individual land uses shall also
apply to individual land uses within a group development, as will all other
applicable provisions of this chapter. Therefore, land uses permitted by right
in the zoning district shall be permitted by right within an approved group
development (unless otherwise restricted by the conditions of approval imposed
during the special use approval for the group development as a whole), and land
uses permitted as a special use in the zoning district shall be permitted
within the group development only with special use approval for the specific
use. In all cases, the following special use conditions shall be applied to the
group development as a whole, and to individual uses within the group
development:
      (1)   All required off-street parking spaces and access drives shall be
located entirely within the boundaries of the group development.
      (2)   The development shall contain a sufficient number of waste bins to
accommodate all trash and waste generated by the land uses in a convenient
manner.
      (3)   No group development shall take access to a local residential
street.
      (4)   All development located within a group development shall be located
so as to comply with the intent of this chapter regarding setbacks of
structures and buildings from lot lines. As such, individual principal and
accessory structures and buildings located within group developments shall be
situated within building area envelopes that serve to demonstrate complete
compliance with said intent. Building area envelopes shall be depicted on the
site plan required for review of group developments. The use of this approach
to designing group developments will also ensure the facilitation of
subdividing group developments in the future, (if such action is so desired).
      (5)   The following standards shall apply to all single structures that
require special use approval as per §
154.924 due to their size and to all multi-building group developments in which
the combined total of all structures on a site, regardless of diverse
ownership, use or tenancy, combine to exceed twice the maximum build size
requiring special use approval. These conditions shall also be applied to the
entire building and site in instances where building additions cause the total
building size to exceed these amounts. Such conditions shall apply to both the
building additions and to older portions of the building and the site that were
constructed prior to the adoption of this section.
         (a)   Building exterior materials shall be of high quality on all
sides of the structure including glass, brick, decorative concrete block, or
stucco.
         (b)   Decorative architectural metal with concealed fasteners may be
approved with special permission from the city.
         (c)   Building exterior design shall be unified in design and
materials throughout the structure, and shall be complementary to other
structures in the vicinity. However, the development shall employ varying
building setbacks, height, roof, treatments, door and window openings, and
other structural and decorative elements to reduce the apparent size and scale
of the structure. A minimum of 20% of the combined facades of the structure
shall employ actual facade protrusions or recesses. A minimum of 20% of the
combined linear roof eave or parapet lines of the structure shall employ
differences in height of eight feet or more. Roofs with particular slopes may
be required by the city to complement existing buildings or otherwise establish
a particular aesthetic objective.
         (d)   Mechanical equipment, refuse containers and any permitted
outdoor storage shall be fully concealed from on-site and off-site ground level
views with materials identical to those used on the building exterior.
         (e)   Standard corporate trademark building designs, materials,
architectural elements, and colors all shall be acceptable, as determined by
the city, only as subtly integrated into the more generic design of the
building as a whole. Color schemes of all architectural elements shall be
muted, neutral, non-reflective and non-use nor tenant specific.
         (f)   Public entryways shall be prominently indicated from the
building's exterior design, and shall be emphasized by on-site traffic flow
patterns. All sides of the building that directly face or abut a public street
shall have public entrances.
         (g)   Loading areas shall be completely screened from surrounding
roads, residential, office, and commercial properties. Said screening may be
through internal loading areas, a screening wall which will match the building
exterior in materials and design, fully opaque landscaping at time of planting,
or combinations of the above. Gates and fencing may be used for security
purposes, but not for screening, and shall be of high aesthetic quality.
         (h)   Vehicle access from public streets shall be designed to
accommodate peak traffic volumes without disrupting traffic on public streets
from inadequate throat length access, drive-width or design, or inadequate
driveway location. The impact of traffic generated by the proposed development
shall be demonstrated by a traffic impact analysis performed by the applicant's
traffic engineer to not adversely impact off-site public roads, intersections,
and interchanges during the traffic peak associated with a full parking lot.
Where the project shall adversely impact off-site traffic, the city may deny
the application, may require a size reduction in the proposed development, or
may require off-site improvements.
         (i)   Parking lot design shall employ interior landscaped islands with
a minimum of 400 square feet at all parking isle ends, and in addition shall
provide a minimum of one landscaped island of a minimum of 400 square feet in
each parking isle for every 20 cars in that aisle. Aisle-end islands shall
count toward meeting this requirement. Landscaped medians shall be used to
break large parking areas into distinct pods, with a maximum of 100 spaces in
any one pod.
         (j)   A minimum of one 200 square foot cart return area shall be
provided for every parking area pod. There shall be no exterior cart return nor
cart storage areas located within twenty-five feet of the building in areas
located between the building and a public street.
         (k)   The applicant shall demonstrate full compliance with city
standards for stormwater, utilities, erosion control and public safety.
         (l)   On-site landscaping shall be provided per the landscaping
requirements of §
154.601 through
154.605 except that building foundation landscaping and paved area landscaping
shall be provided at 1.5 times the required amount of landscape materials
(other than ground cover) for development in the zoning district.
         (m)   A conceptual plan for exterior signage shall provide for
coordinated and complementary exterior sign locations, configurations, and
colors throughout the group development. All freestanding signage within the
development shall complement the on-building signage. Free standing sign
materials and design shall complement building exterior, and may not exceed the
maximum height requirements of §§
154.801 through 154.815.
         (n)   The entire development shall provide for full and safe
pedestrian and bicycle access within the development, and shall provide
appropriate connections to the existing and planned pedestrian and bicycle
facilities in the community and in surrounding neighborhoods, including
sidewalk connections to all building entrances from all public streets. The
development shall provide secure bicycle parking and pedestrian furniture in
appropriate quantities and location. A central pedestrian gathering area shall
be provided.
         (o)   Where such developments are proposed to provide a new location
for a business already located within the community, a required condition of
approval for the new development shall be a prohibition on conditions of sale,
lease, or use of the previously occupied building or site which provide limits
beyond the range of applicable local, state or federal regulations. If such
limits are required, the applicant may seek city approval to demolish the
previously occupied structure and prepare the site for some future development.
         (p)   The applicant shall provide adequate evidence that the proposed
development and uses cannot be adequately sited within or on existing developed
properties or buildings within the community.
         (q)   The Zoning Board of Appeals may waive any of the above standards
by a three- fourths vote of members in attendance, but only if supplemental
design elements or improvements are incorporated into the project that
compensate for the waiver of the particular standard.
   (D)   Discrimination against condominium forms of ownership. It is not the
intent of this section, nor any other provision of this chapter, to
discriminate against condominium forms of ownership in any manner which
conflicts with Illinois Statutes. As such, the provisions of this section are
designed to ensure that condominium forms of ownership are subject to the same
standards and procedures of review and development as other physically
identical forms of development.

NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION STANDARDS
§ 154.501 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to set forth the requirements for the
protection and preservation of natural resources and permanently protected
green space areas within the jurisdiction of this chapter. In part, the
provisions of this subchapter are designed to ensure the implementation of the
city's adopted Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.502 HOW TO USE THIS SUBCHAPTER.
   This subchapter contains the standards which govern the protection,
disturbance, and mitigation of disruption of all natural resource and other
permanently protected green space areas. The provisions of this subchapter are
intended to supplement those of the City of Galena, Jo Daviess County, the
State of Illinois, and the federal government of the United States which
pertain to natural resource protection. This subchapter recognizes the
important and diverse benefits which natural resource features provide in terms
of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Each of
the following sections is oriented to each natural resource type, and is
designed to accomplish several objectives:
   (A)   First, a definition of the natural resource is provided.
   (B)   Second, the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing
each natural resource type are provided.
   (C)   Third, the required method of identifying and determining the
boundaries of the natural resource area is given.
   (D)   Fourth, mandatory protection requirements are identified.
   (E)   Fifth, where permitted, mitigation standards are provided.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.503 NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Compliance. All new development (including building construction,
other site improvements, and/or site preparation), additions existing
development (including building construction, other site improvements and/or
site preparation), along with all new subdivision plats, condominiums, and site
plans, in all zoning districts, shall comply with the resource protection
standards set forth in
Table 154.503.1.
   (B)   Natural resources to remain undisturbed. All of the natural resources
required to be protected under this subchapter shall remain undisturbed and in
a natural state except those natural resources where mitigation is permitted
and where that mitigation is in strict accord with those requirements set forth
in this subchapter.
   (C)   Disturbance of existing natural resources. Removal of protected
natural resources as defined in this subchapter from a property before any
development approvals from the city are sought shall not be allowed unless the
property owner obtains a site plan approval and meets the standards of this
subchapter for natural resource preservation. All clear cutting and destruction
of natural resource features shall:
      (1)   Require a site plan review and approval as per §
154.914, and shall be in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.
      (2)   Be required to meet the protection levels described in this
subchapter.
      (3)   Where such clear cutting and/or destruction violations occur, be
required to meet the mitigation standards set forth under the provisions of
this subchapter.

total combined occurrences of such features on lands held in common ownership,
rather than over each of any two or more individual occurrences of steep slopes or
woodlands on such lands. Lands shall be considered to share a common boundary even
if they are divided by a public road or navigable waterway, or if they connect at
only one point.
(4)   Whether mitigation is permitted shall be determined by the Zoning
Administrator on a case-by-case basis.
(5)   If not otherwise restricted by state or federal regulations, the Zoning
Administrator may allow the filling or alteration of up to one acre of wetland
without mitigation if such filling or alteration is essential for public safety
purposes as defined under state law.
 
   (D)   Natural resource protection plan.  If natural resource features
defined and described in this subchapter are present on a property, a Natural
Resource Protection Plan shall be submitted, which shall show the following:
      (1)   Proposed name. The proposed name of the development.
      (2)   Location. The location of the proposed development.
      (3)   Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the owners, subdividers,
lessee and/or developer. The names, addressees, and telephone numbers of the
owners, subdividers, lessee and/ or developer(s) of the property and of the
designer of the plan.
      (4)   Date. Date of the Natural Resource Plan submittal and all
applicable revision dates.
      (5)   Site boundary. The boundary line of the site with dimensions and
bearings, indicated by a solid line, and the total land area encompassed by the
site.
      (6)   Lot lines, right-of-way lines, and easements. The location of all
proposed lot lines, right-of-way lines, and easements.
      (7)   Existing streets. The location, ownership, widths, and names (if
available) of all existing and previously platted streets, rights-of-way,
parks, and other public or open spaces located within or adjacent to the
subject property.
      (8)   Easements and neighboring property boundaries.  The location and
dimensions of all permanent easements and the subject property boundary lines
adjacent to the site.

numerical illustration shown on the Natural Resource Protection Plan of those
existing natural resource features that will be disturbed and those that will
be preserved and showing on the illustration the area (in square feet or acres)
of each existing resource and those areas of resources that are to be
preserved. Numerical data may be shown in tabular form with labeled reference
to specific areas designated on the Natural Resource Protection Plan. Any areas
of the site where natural resources are to be mitigated and how and where the
mitigation is to take place with the natural resource protection easements
shall be indicated.
      (11)   Method of natural resource preservation. Graphic illustration and
notes relating to how those natural resource features, which are to be
preserved, will actually be preserved (conservation easements, deed
restrictions, protective covenants, etc.)
      (12)   Scale, north arrow, contours. A drawing legend containing the
scale appropriate to the size of the Site Plan, the date of preparation, north

§ 154.504 NATURAL RESOURCE MEASUREMENT.
   All land area within a proposed development, site plan, subdivision plat, or
condominium consisting of the natural resource features defined in this
subchapter shall be accurately measured by the petitioner. The total square
feet and acreage of each natural resource feature shall be multiplied by its
respective Natural Resource Protection Standard as set forth in
Table 154.503.1 to determine the amount of each natural resource feature to be
protected by a conservation easement. If two or more natural resource features
are present on the same area of land, only the most restrictive natural
resource protection standard shall be used.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.505 NATURAL RESOURCE FEATURES MITIGATION.
   (A)   Intent of mitigation. The city recognizes that property owners,
subdividers, or condominium developers may wish to develop in portions of those
protected natural resource feature areas shown as eligible for mitigation in
Table 154.503.1. Provisions in this subchapter set forth the conditions for
mitigation and mitigation standards for the various natural resource features
for which mitigation is allowed under the provisions of
Table 154.503.1. The intent of these provisions is not to permit greater
destruction of natural resource features than is permitted under the
requirements of this subchapter for a typical property or development. This
subchapter sets specific standards for use when the extent of the natural
resources on a site and the use of the regulations would create a major
hardship for said natural resource feature protection. Thus, mitigation is
intended to be used instead of a variance request when severe hardships would
result from the strict enforcement of the natural resource protection standards
and requirements set forth in this subchapter.
   (B)   Off-site mitigation.  Off-site mitigation may be permitted if such
off-site mitigation occurs within the same watershed as the natural resource
feature or property being mitigated and follows the methods, requirements,
standards, and/or criteria set forth under this subchapter. All permitted off-
site mitigation shall occur within the corporate limits of the city.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.506 STEEP SLOPES.
   (A)   Definition. Three categories of steep slopes are defined herein for
use in this chapter. These categories are based upon the relative degree of the
steepness of the slope as follows:
      (1)   Slopes of 20% to 30% inclusive.
      (2)   Slopes greater than 30%.
      (3)   No land shall be considered a steep slope unless the steep slope
area has at least a 20% vertical drop and has a minimum area of 5,000 square
feet.
   (B)   Purpose. Steep slopes are particularly susceptible to damage resulting
from site disruption, primarily related to soil erosion. Such damage is likely
to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed. Such erosion reduces
the productivity of the soil, results in exacerbated erosion downhill, and
results in increased sedimentation in drainageways, wetlands, streams, ponds
and lakes. Beyond adversely affecting the environmental functions of these
resource areas, such sedimentation also increases flood hazards by reducing the
flood water storage capacity of hydrological system components, thus elevating
the flood level of the drainage system in effected areas. Beyond these threats
to public safety, disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of
slippage and slumping - unstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent
properties, buildings, and public facilities such as roads and utilities.
   (C)   Determination of presence.  
      (1)   Steep slopes are to be determined by using the following sources
and/or methods in the order indicated below. If the first source is considered
inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, the
succeeding source shall be used:
         (a)   A topographic survey prepared by and certified by an Illinois
registered land surveyor at the petitioner's expense at a contour interval of
not less than two feet.
         (b)   Topographic maps on file with the city.
         (c)   U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps.
      (2)   The area of steep slopes (in square feet or acres) shall be
measured and graphically delineated on a topographic drawing and on the Natural
Resource Protection Plan. Such steep slope drawing shall graphically indicate
those steep slope areas, by slope type, of the property pursuant to the STEEP
SLOPE definition set forth in this section.
   (D)   Protection standards.  Steep slope areas shall be retained to the
extent shown on
Table 154.503.1. Protected portions of steep slopes shall remain in an
undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted per the requirements of §
154.404.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.507 WOODLANDS AND FOREST.
   (A)   Definition.
      (1)   Woodlands, young. An area or stand of trees whose total combined
canopy covers an area of one-half acre or more and at least 50% of which is
composed of canopies of trees having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of at
least three inches. However, no trees grown for commercial purposes shall be
considered a young woodland.
      (2)   Woodlands, mature. An area or stand of trees whose total combined
canopy covers an area of one acre or more and at least 50% of which is composed
of canopies of trees having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of at least ten
inches; or any grove consisting of eight or more individual trees having a DBH
of at least 12 inches whose combined canopies cover at least 50% of the area
encompassed by the grove. However, no trees grown for commercial purposes
should be considered a mature woodland.
      (3)   Woodlands include all tree species listed as large, deciduous trees
and evergreen trees as listed in Appendix B.
   (B)   Purpose. Woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions.
These include atmospheric benefits such as removing air-borne pollutants,
carbon dioxide uptake, oxygen production, and evapotranspiration returns. Water
quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates (particularly for
nitrogen and phosphorus) and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes
and velocities. Woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources.
Woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers, greatly reducing runoff-related soil
erosion. Woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities, which further reduces
soil erosion. Finally, under proper management techniques, woodlands serve as
regenerative fuel sources.
   (C)   Determination of presence.
      (1)   The determination of woodland and forest boundaries shall be
determined by using the following sources and/ or methods in the order
indicated below. If the first source is considered inaccurate or inappropriate
by the Zoning Administrator the succeeding source shall be used:
         (a)   A field survey of trees compiled at the petitioner's expense by
a registered land surveyor and identified by a landscape architect, forester,
arborist, or botanist with a professional degree in one of those fields of
endeavor.
         (b)   The most recent 1" = 400' aerial photographs prepared by the
city.
      (2)   Each woodland and forest area shall include the tree trunk and the
area located within the drip line or tree canopy. The area of woodlands and
forests (mature and young), in square feet or acres, shall be measured and
graphically delineated on the Natural Resource Protection Plan. Such woodland
and forest area drawing shall indicate all woodland and forest areas of the
property meeting the minimum size criteria established by the definitions of
WOODLANDS (MATURE AND YOUNG) in this section. In cases where the drip line or
canopy areas overlap, the areas of overlap shall only be counted once. In cases
where drip line or canopy areas overlap property lines, the property line(s)
are to be used as the boundary for the woodland or forest area, with only that
portion of the drip line area located on the subject property counted toward
the woodland or forest area. The location, size, and summary of species types
of all healthy trees having a diameter at breast height (DBH) of ten inches or
greater that are located in woodland and forest areas within 25 feet of any
proposed improvement and/or in woodland and forest areas to be demolished due
to the placement of improvements or grading are to be graphically shown on the
Natural Resource Protection Plan or submitted  as a separate drawing. For the
remaining undisturbed areas of the site plan, subdivision plat, or condominium
only the outline of woodland and forest areas indicating whether they are
mature or young woodlands is required. The Natural Resource Protection Plan
shall include an estimate of the percentage of all healthy trees within each
woodland or forest area that have a DBH of three inches or greater and ten
inches or greater.
   (D)   Protection standards.  Woodland areas shall be retained to the extent
shown on
Table 154.503.1. Protected portions of woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed
state except for the land uses permitted per the requirements of §
154.404.
   (E)   Mitigation.  Woodlands and forest areas may be mitigated under either
of the following two alternative requirements applicable to the mitigation of
woodland and forest areas, except that the Zoning Administrator may approve
different sizes and types of plantings in mitigation areas where site
conditions or context warrant:
      (1)   Alternative 1:
         (a)   Mitigation shall include the planting of one and one-quarter
acres of new woodland/forest for every one acre of disturbed woodland/forest
for which mitigation is required.
         (b)   Mitigation shall include the replacement of woodlands/forests
disturbed. Such mitigation shall consist of the planting of new woodland/forest
areas, as specified above, using the following numbers of plants per acre of
mitigated area:
            1.   Fifteen canopy trees, minimum three and one-half-inch
caliper*.
            2.   Twelve canopy trees, minimum two-inch caliper.
            3.   Two hundred fifty canopy trees, minimum four-foot high whips.
            4.   Fifty understory trees, minimum five-foot high whips
            5.   Twenty-five shrubs, minimum 12 inches high
*Note: Each three and one-half-inch caliper canopy tree may be substituted with
two one and one-half-inch caliper canopy trees.
         (c)   All mitigation shall be in addition to landscaping required
under §
154.605.
      (2)   Alternative 2:
         (a)   Mitigation shall include the planting of one and one-half acres
of new woodland/forest for every one acre of disturbed woodland/forest for
which mitigation is required.
         (b)   Mitigation shall include the replacement of woodlands/forests
disturbed. Such mitigation shall consist of the planting of new woodland/forest
areas, as specified above, using the following number of plants per acre of
mitigated area:
            1.   Twelve canopy trees, minimum three and one-half-inch caliper*.
            2.   Ten canopy trees, minimum two-inch caliper.
            3.   Two hundred canopy trees, minimum four-foot high whips.
            4.   Forty understory trees, minimum five-foot high whips.
            5.   Twenty shrubs, minimum 12 inches high.
*Note: Each three and one-half-inch caliper canopy tree may be substituted with
two one and one-half-inch caliper canopy trees.
            (c)   All mitigation shall be in addition to landscaping required
under §
154.605.
         (3)   The species of plants to be used in the mitigation of woodlands/
forests shall be similar to those destroyed and a minimum mix of six species
are to be planted. Acceptable species for woodland and forest mitigation are as
indicated in
Table 154.507.1. The species of trees to be used shall be selected by a
qualified professional based on, among other considerations, topography and
soil type. No more than 80% of the total number of trees planted for mitigation
purposes, however, shall be of any single species.
         (4)   The land upon which the mitigation is to take place shall be
protected with a deed restriction and conservation easement as a permanent
natural resource features conservation easement.
         (5)   No tree cutting or removal, after the adoption of this code,
shall reduce the woodland/forest natural resource features protection
requirements of this code.

§ 154.508 DRAINAGEWAYS.
   (A)   Definition. A drainageway is a course of running water, either
perennial or intermittent, flowing in a channel.
   (B)   Purpose. Drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to
downstream areas. As such, drainageways serve to carry surface waters,
supplement floodplain, wetland, and water storage functions in heavy storm or
melt events, filter water-borne pollutants and sediments, promote infiltration
and groundwater recharging, and provide a unique habitat at the land/water
margin. Drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as
well as greatly reduce the potential for soil erosion along drainageways by
protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which are susceptible to variable
runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement.
   (C)   Determination of presence. 
      (1)   Drainageways are to be determined by using the definition of
DRAINAGEWAY as set forth in §
154.015 and the sources in the order indicated below. If the first source is
considered inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, the succeeding source shall be used:
         (a)   A topographic survey prepared at the petitioner's expense by and
certified by an Illinois registered land surveyor at a contour interval of not
less than two feet.
         (b)   Topographic maps on file with the city.
         (c)   U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps.
      (2)   The area of drainageways (in square feet and acres) shall be
measured and graphically delineated on the Natural Resource Protection Plan.
   (D)   Protection standards.  Drainageways shall be protected as indicated on
Table 154.503.1. Protected portions of drainageways shall remain in an
undisturbed state except for the land use permitted per the requirements of §
154.404.
   (E)   Mitigation. Drainageway mitigation may be permitted under the
requirements of the Illinois State Statutes, and administrative rules
promulgated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). If such
statutes or rules do not provide sufficient guidance on required mitigation,
the city shall require the preparation and submittal of a wetland mitigation
plan by a professional wetland mitigation specialist, and the petitioner shall
be responsible for all costs necessary for the city to conduct a professional
review of the mitigation plan. In addition, a permit from the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers pursuant to the requirements of section 404 of the Clean Water Act
(33 U.S.C. 1344) and/or the IDNR shall be submitted to the city certifying that
the filling has been approved and permitted by the Corps and/or IDNR.
Alternatively, the applicant must obtain and provide to the city written
correspondence from said agencies that a state or federal permit is not
required, as a condition of city review.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.509 SHORE BUFFERS.
   (A)   Definition. All of the land area located within 75 feet inland of the
ordinary high water mark of all ponds, streams, lakes, wetlands, and navigable
high water mark of all rivers.
   (B)   Purpose. Shore buffers serve to protect land/water margins from
erosion due to site disruption. Because of regular contact with wave action,
currents, and runoff, such areas are highly susceptible to continuous, and in
some cases, rapid erosion. Shore protection also provides a natural vegetation
buffer which serves to reduce water velocities and wave energy, and filters
significant amounts of water-borne pollutants and sediments. Shore buffers also
promote infiltration and groundwater recharging, and provide a unique habitat
at the land/water margin.
   (C)   Determination of presence.  
      (1)   Shore buffers are to be determined as the land within 75 feet of
the ordinary high water mark of all navigable waters and parallel to that
ordinary high water mark, where required. Navigable waters are to be determined
by using the definition of NAVIGABLE WATER set forth in §
154.015 and the sources in the order indicated below. If the first source is
considered inaccurate or inappropriate, as determined by the Zoning
Administrator, the succeeding source shall be used:
         (a)   A topographic survey prepared by and certified by an Illinois
registered land surveyor at the petitioner's expense at a contour interval of
not less than two feet.
         (b)   Topographic maps on file with the city.
         (c)   U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps.
      (2)   The area of shore buffers (in square feet and acres) shall be
measured and graphically delineated on the Natural Resource Protection Plan.
   (D)   Protection standards. With the exception of the activities permitted
below, shore areas shall remain in undisturbed state, except for the land uses
permitted per the requirements of §
154.404.
      (1)   Tree removal.
         (a)   Purpose. The intent and purpose of this subsection is to
preserve the natural wooded areas that help comprise the city's character,
maintain property values by improving and preserving the aesthetic appeal of
the city through tree regulations, preserve the natural resources of the city
and state, reduce the amount of erosion in the city due to tree removal,
protect the quality of the waters of the state and the city, and protect and
promote the health, safety and welfare of the people by minimizing the amount
of sediment and other pollutants carried by runoff to surface waters due to the
erosion of land not protected by a naturally wooded environment.
         (b)   Clear-cutting prohibition.
            1.    Waterfront shoreland areas. In a strip of land 35 feet wide
inland from the bulkhead line, no more than 30 feet in any 100 feet shall be
clear-cut. Where the lot is less than 100 feet, no more than 30% of this strip
shall be clear-cut. Natural shrubbery shall be preserved as far as practicable
and, where removed, it shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally
effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion and preserving natural
beauty.
            2.   Tree preservation area.  Except for circumstances identified
under division (c), below, it is prohibited to remove any tree or cause any
trees to be removed from the tree preservation area of each lot. During
construction, no equipment movement, construction or placement of equipment or
material storage shall be permitted in the tree preservation area.
         (c)   Cutting exceptions.
            1.   Trees may be removed from the building activities area. This
area shall be as small as possible, including the entire area affected by
building, grading, and temporary material storage areas. In no case shall the
amount of trees with a six-inch tree diameter removed within the building
activities area exceed the following:
               a.   Eighty percent of the total of such trees on lots of one-
quarter acre or less.
               b.   Sixty percent of the total of such trees on lots of one-
quarter acre to one acre, except in the CSR District.
               c.   Forty percent of the total of such trees on lots of one
acre to two and one-half acres, except in the CSR District.
               d.   Twenty percentof the total of such trees on lots of two and
one-half acres or more, except in the CSR District.
               e.   Ten percent of the total of such trees on all lots in the
CSR District.
            2.   Trees removed in excess of the above will require a tree
removal permit. Conditions under which a permit may be issued include, but will
not be limited to, the following:
               a.   The tree is dead, dying or diseased.
               b.   The tree is damaged or injured to the extent that it is
likely to die or become diseased.
               c.   The removal of the tree will enhance the tree preservation
area and the health of the remaining trees.
               d.   The removal of the tree will avoid or alleviate an economic
hardship or hardship of another nature to the property or residences.
               e.   The removal of the tree is consistent with good
arboriculture practices.
      (2)   Replacement trees. When in keeping with good arboriculture
practices, replacement trees shall be planted for all removed trees. They may
be planted in the tree preservation area or in the building activities area
after the initial construction activities are completed. All replacement trees
shall be planted within 30 days of final grading. The determination of good
arboriculture shall be based on tree density and spacing of
Table 154.509.1.
      (3)   Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this section shall
be subject to a penalty per tree illegally cut or removed, which shall be
determined by the assessed value of the trees removed. The assessed value shall
be determined in accordance with the Manual for Plant Appraisers, published by
the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers, most recent edition. In addition,
a replacement tree shall be planted, of equivalent caliper, to replace each
tree cut illegally.

§ 154.510 ISOLATED WETLANDS, LAKES AND PONDS.
   (A)   Definition.  ISOLATED WETLANDS are those areas where water is at,
near, or above the land surface long enough to support aquatic or hydrophytic
vegetation and which have soils indicative of wet conditions that are no longer
under regulation by the Federal Clean Water Act administered by the U. S. Army
Corps of Engineers (Corps). For JURISDICTIONAL WETLANDS under Corps regulation,
please refer to the Corps website: http://www.lrc.usace.army.mil/cor/index.htm.
   (B)   Purpose. These provisions are intended to maintain safe and healthful
conditions, prevent water pollution, protect wildlife habitat, manage flooding,
protect personal property and real estate, and control building and development
in wetlands no longer under regulation by the Federal Clean Water Act
administered by the Corps. When development is permitted in isolated wetland
areas, the development should occur in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts
upon the wetland.
   (C)   Determination of presence. Wetland areas shall be determined at the
petitioner's expense by a field survey and mapping of plant material by a
botanist with a professional degree in either botany or biology. The area of
wetlands (in square feet and acres) shall be measured and graphically
delineated on the Natural Resource Protection Plan.
   (D)   Protection standards. Wetlands shall be protected as indicated on
Table 154.503.1. Protected portions of wetlands shall remain in an undisturbed
state except for the land use permitted per the requirements of §
154.404.
   (E)   Mitigation. Wetlands mitigation may be permitted under the
requirements of the Illinois State Statutes, and administrative rules
promulgated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) under that
section. If such statutes or rules do not provide sufficient guidance on
required mitigation, the city shall require the preparation and submittal of a
wetland mitigation plan by a professional wetland mitigation specialist, and
the petitioner shall be responsible for all costs necessary for the city to
conduct a professional review of the mitigation plan. In addition, a permit
from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the requirements of section
404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344) and/or the IDNR shall be submitted
to the city certifying that filling has been approved and permitted by the
Corps and/or IDNR. Alternatively, the petitioner must obtain and provide to the
city written correspondence from said agencies that a state or federal permit
is not required, as a condition of city review.

PARKING, LIGHTING AND LANDSCAPE STANDARDS
§ 154.601 OFF-STREET PARKING AND TRAFFIC CIRCULATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent
congestion of public rights-of-ways so as to promote safety and general welfare
of the public by establishing minimum requirements for the provision of off-
street parking and circulation in accordance with the utilization of various
sites.
   (B)   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all new
development and redevelopment projects as follows:
      (1)   New principal structures. Shall comply with all provisions of this
section.
      (2)   Additions to principal structures. Shall comply with all provisions
of this section as they apply only to the area of addition.
      (3)   New accessory structures. Accessory structures that contain uses
that have parking requirements separate from those of the principal structure
and use as per division (H)(3) shall comply with all provisions of this section
as they apply only to the accessory structure.
      (4)   Additions to accessory structures. Accessory structures that
contain uses that have parking requirements separate from those of the
principal structure and use as per division (H)(3) shall comply with all
provisions of this section as they apply only to the addition to the accessory
structure.
      (5)   Changes in use of existing structure. Shall be exempt provided the
change in use does not include any new structures or additions to existing
structures.
      (6)   New parking and circulation areas that are not required.  Shall
comply with all provisions of this section except for the number of spaces
required as per division (H).
   (C)   Location of parking areas. All parking and traffic circulation areas
shall be shown on the site plan required for development of the property.
      (1)   Distance from parking being served. Off-street automobile parking
facilities shall be located as specified below. Where a distance is specified,
such distance shall be walking distance measured from the nearest point of the
parking area to the nearest entrance of the building that the parking area
serves.
         (a)   One- and two-family dwellings. On the same lot with the same
building they serve.
         (b)   Three-family to six-family dwellings. On the same lot or parcel
of land as the building they serve. For the purpose of this requirement, a
group of such uses constructed and maintained under common ownership or
management shall be assumed to be on a single lot or parcel of land.
         (c)   Multifamily buildings containing seven or more dwelling units.
On the same lot or parcel of land as the building they serve, or on a separate
lot or parcel of land (under common ownership) not more than 300 feet from the
nearest entrance to the main building being served.
         (d)   Boarding houses and group/institutional residential uses. On the
same lot or parcel of land as the main building or buildings being served, or
upon properties that are contiguous and under common ownership.
         (e)   Uses other than those specified above. On the same lot or parcel
of land as the main building being served, or on a separate lot or parcel of
land (under common ownership or long-term lease) not over 1,000 feet of any
entrance of the main building.
      (2)   Off-site parking. All off-site parking areas shall comply with the
provisions of §
154.406(F).
   (D)   Use of off-street parking. The use of all required off-street parking
areas shall be limited to the parking of operable vehicles not for lease, rent,
or sale. Within residential districts, required parking spaces shall be used
only by operable cars and trucks. Semi/tractor trailers shall be prohibited in
all parking areas, except loading areas that comply with §
154.602.
   (E)   Traffic circulation and traffic control. Site circulation shall be
designed to provide for the safe and efficient movement of all traffic
entering, exiting, and on the site. Circulation shall be provided to meet the
individual needs of the site with specific mixing of access and through
movements. Circulation patterns shall conform with the general rules of the
road and all traffic control measures shall meet the requirements of the Manual
of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
   (F)   Installation and maintenance of off-street parking and traffic
circulation areas.  All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas shall
be completed prior to building occupancy and shall be maintained in a dust-free
condition at all times. In no instance shall any off-street parking or traffic
circulation area be used as a storage area, except as provided for by §§
154.401 through
154.407.
   (G)   Off-street parking and traffic circulation design standards.
      (1)   Surface and marking. All open off-street parking areas and
driveways, except those accessory to single-family dwellings, shall be improved
with either six inches of compacted gravel base surfaced with two inches of
asphaltic concrete, or five inches of concrete laid over a firm base or
alternative, pervious paving materials over an improved base that provides
sufficient bearing capacity. Parking areas intended for six or more parking
stalls shall be marked in a manner which clearly indicates the required parking
spaces.
      (2)   Curbing. All off-street parking areas designed to have head-in
parking adjacent to a landscaped area shall provide a tire bumper or curb of
adequate height and which is properly located to ensure that no part of any
vehicle will project into the landscape by more that one and one-half feet.
      (3)   Lighting. All off-street parking and traffic circulation areas
serving six or more cars shall be lit so as to ensure the safe and efficient
use of said areas during the hours of use. An illumination level of between 0.4
and 1.0 footcandles is recommended, however, the illumination level shall not
exceed the standards of §
154.604.
      (4)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly
upon an aisle or driveway that is wide enough and designed to provide a safe
and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking space without directly
backing or maneuvering a vehicle into a public right-of-way exceeding 50 feet
in width. All off-street parking and traffic circulation facilities shall be
designed with an appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in
a manner which least interferes with traffic movements. No driveway across
public property, or requiring a curb cut, shall exceed a width of 25 feet. Off-
street parking spaces for residential uses may be stacked or in front of one
another for the same dwelling unit. Parking spaces located behind an enclosed
garage and located directly off a through aisle or alley shall be a minimum of
25 feet deep.
      (5)   Signage. All signage located within, or related to, required off-
street parking or traffic circulation shall comply with the requirements of
this code.
      (6)   Handicapped parking spaces. Parking for the handicapped shall be
provided at a size, number, location, and with signage as specified by city,
state and federal regulations.
      (7)   Parking space design standards. Other than parking required to
serve the handicapped, all off-street parking spaces shall comply with the
minimum requirements of
Table 154.601.1. The minimum required length of parking spaces shall be 17.5
feet, plus an additional 1.5-foot vehicle overhang area at the end of the
stall. All parking spaces shall have a minimum vertical clearance of at least
seven feet.
      (8)   Minimum permitted throat length.  
Table 154.601.2 provides the minimum permitted throat length of access drives
serving parking lots, as measured from the right-of-way line along the
centerline of the access drive.
      (9)   Snow storage. Required off-street parking and traffic circulation
areas shall not be used for snow storage.
      (10)    Parking lot design standards. Horizontal widths for parking rows,
aisles, and modules shall be provided at widths no less than listed in
Table 154.601.1. Additional design standards apply to group developments as set
forth in §
154.406(A).
      (11)    Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping shall comply with the
requirements of the paved area landscaping requirements in §
154.605.
      (12)    Locational prohibitions for off-street parking areas.
         (a)   No portion of any parking space shall be located within a
required front yard, excepting, however, that one required parking space for a
dwelling unit may be located within the required front yard when sole access to
the unit is from a public street and provided said parking space is located on
the driveway affording access to a garage or carport attached to the unit. Any
wall, fence or hedge developed around any parking area shall be subject to the
front yard setback requirements of this chapter in the same manner as the
principal structure.
         (b)   Off-street parking shall not be located between the principal
structure on a residential lot and a street right-of-way, except within
residential driveways and parking lots designated on the approved site plan.
         (c)   No private parking shall occur on street terraces, driveways, or
any other areas located within a public right-of-way not explicitly designated
by the City Council in
Chapter 72 of this code.
      (13)   Alternative parking surfaces and designs. For land uses with
infrequent peak periods, such as, but not limited to, churches and other public
assembly venues, alternative parking surfaces and designs may be approved upon
administrative review of the site plan. The Zoning Administrator may defer
approval to the Zoning Board of Appeals as a special use, or a non-
administrative highway development permit if the project is within the Highway
Corridor Overlay District. The alternatives may include pervious or semi-
pervious surfaces and/or other methods intended to reduce the amount of paving
required. To receive approval, the applicant shall clearly demonstrate the low
frequency of peak use and that the alternative(s) proposed improve the overall
quality and function of the site from both a development and natural resources
protection perspective. In approving alternatives, the city may attach all
conditions as necessary to ensure the public health, safety, and welfare are
protected as intended in this section, including a requirement that the use of
the approved alternative(s) be monitored at the applicant's expense and regular
reports be provided to the city. The city shall also reserve the right to
repeal its approval and require full compliance with all standards and
regulations of this section if it finds the alternative(s) fails to function as
anticipated.

   (H)   Calculation of minimum required parking spaces.
      (1)   General guidelines for calculating required parking spaces. The
requirements of division (H)(3) below shall be used to determine the minimum
required number of off-site parking spaces which must be provided for the
proposed use. Requirements are generally tied to the capacity of the use; the
gross floor area of the use; or the number of employees which work at the
subject property during the largest work shift. The term CAPACITY as used
herein means the maximum number of persons that may be accommodated by the use
as determined by its design or by the city Building Code regulations, whichever
number is greater. References to "employees on the largest work shift" means

§ 154.604 PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT LIGHTING STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the spill-over of
light and glare on operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses in
the vicinity of a light source in order to promote traffic safety and to
prevent the creation of nuisances.
   (B)   Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all private
exterior lighting within the jurisdiction of this chapter, except for lighting
within public rights-of-way and/or lighting located on public property.
   (C)   Lighting plan. The developer shall submit sufficient information in
the form of an overall exterior lighting and photometric plan to enable the
Planning Department to determine that the applicable provisions of this code
will be satisfied. The plan shall include at least the following.
      (1)   A site plan, drawn to a standard engineering scale of not more than
100 feet to the inch (1 inch = 100 feet), showing the building footprints or
buildable lot area, streets and all proposed exterior lighting fixtures; and
      (2)   Specifications or details for all proposed lighting fixtures
including photometric data, information about fixtures, Color Rendering Index
(CRI) of all lamps (bulbs) and other descriptive information on the fixtures
including height of fixtures.
   (D)   Requirements.
      (1)   Fixture standards. All fixtures shall be full cut-off or a shielded
type, not allowing any upward distribution of light. Full cut-off fixtures must
be installed in a horizontal position as designed. Up- lighting shall be
prohibited.
      (2)   Intensity of illumination.
         (a)   In no instance shall the amount of illumination attributable to
exterior lighting, as measured at the property line, exceed 0.50 foot-candles
above ambient lighting conditions on a cloudless night.
         (b)   The maximum average on-site lighting in non-residential zoning
districts shall be 2.4 foot-candles (500 watts metal halide or high pressure
sodium, 250 watts low pressure sodium).
         (c)   The maximum average on-site lighting in residential zoning
districts shall be 0.90 foot-candles (185 watts metal halide or high pressure
sodium, 90 watts low pressure sodium).
         (d)   The following exceptions shall be permitted:
            a.   Outdoor recreation facilities and assembly areas: Maximum
average on-site lighting of 3.60 foot-candles (750 watts metal halide or high
pressure sodium, 375 watts low pressure sodium).
            b.   Auto display lots: Maximum average on-site lighting of 0.20
foot-candles (50 watts metal halide or high pressure sodium, 25 watts low
pressure sodium).
      (3)   Location. Light fixtures shall not be located within required
bufferyards.
      (4)   Flashing, flickering, and other distracting lighting. Flashing,
flickering and/or lighting which may distract motorists are prohibited.

      (1)   Lighting levels on gas station aprons and under canopies shall be
adequate to conduct the activities taking place in such locations.
      (2)   Light fixtures mounted under canopies to light the gasoline pump
islands shall be recessed so that the lens cover is recessed or flush with the
bottom surface (ceiling) of the canopy and/or shielded by the fixture or the
edge of the canopy so that light is restrained to no more than 85 degrees from
vertical. Lighting should be designed to minimize glare and not direct light
beyond the property boundaries in excess of one foot-candle of the area being
illuminated or onto adjacent properties or streets, and should not result in
excessive lighting levels.
         (3)   All non-essential lighting will be required to be turned off
after business hours, leaving only the necessary lighting for security.
         (4)   Spotlighting and any form of up-lighting is prohibited.

§ 154.605 LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERYARD STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The intent of this section is to provide minimum landscaping,
screening and buffering standards to protect and improve community appearance,
mitigate the environmental and aesthetic impacts of new development, prevent
the creation of nuisances and health hazards, and improve quality of life in
the city.
   (B)   How to use this section.
      (1)   This section contains the standards which govern the amount, size,
type, installation and maintenance of required landscaping. This section
recognizes the important and diverse benefits which landscaping provides in
terms of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the community,
and implementing the adopted Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   The landscaping requirements described in this section are
cumulative in nature and are required for all development, except one- and two-
family dwelling units and agricultural uses, in the following locations: around
building foundations, in developed lots, along street frontages, in or around
paved areas, and in bufferyards.
      (3)   In each instance, a "landscaping point" concept is used to provide
a maximum amount of flexibility in terms of the selection of plant materials.
Appendix B provides a listing of plant species fitting into the various plant
categories used by this section, although other species may be permitted with
the approval of the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   Landscaping points and specifications. All landscaping requirements
are stated in terms of the number of landscaping points required. The required
number of landscaping points is dependent upon the type of land use, zoning
district, and the size of the development. A different number of points are
awarded for each plant, depending upon its typical growth rate, its mature
height, and whether it is a deciduous or evergreen species. A minimum
installation size is required for each of these plant categories. These
requirements are specified on
Table 154.605.1.

Footnotes:
(1)   The intent of these provisions is to require a visual break in the mass
of buildings and to require a visual screen of a minimum of 6 feet in height
for all exterior perimeter appurtenances (such as HVAC/utility boxes,
standpipes, stormwater, discharge pipes and other pipes).
(2)   The intent of these requirements is to provide a continuous visual screen
of parking areas from public rights-of-way at a minimum height of 40 inches.
(3)   A minimum of 360 square feet of landscaped area, which shall be located
within 10 feet of the paved area, is required for the placement of every 100
landscaping points. Said area does not have to be provided in one contiguous
area. Plants used to fulfill this requirement shall visually screen parking,
loading and circulation areas from view from public streets.
(4)   Parking lot design shall employ interior landscaped islands with a
minimum of 400 square feet at all parking isle ends, and in addition shall
provide a minimum of one landscaped island of a minimum of 400 square feet in
each parking isle for every 20 cars in that aisle. Aisle-end islands shall
count toward meeting this requirement. Landscaped medians shall be used to
break large parking areas into distinct pods, with a maximum of 100 spaces in
any one pod.
 
   (F)   Bufferyard requirements.
      (1)   Purpose. The provisions of this division are intended to provide
specific landscape screening and bufferyard requirements to reduce the
incompatibility between zoning districts of different intensity and type. These
bufferyards will lessen the adverse impact of more intense land uses upon
residential areas and/or other areas of less intense use be reducing notice,
visual and other environmental impacts.
      (2)   Requirements. In addition to the minimum landscaping and screening
requirements contained in division (E) above, these bufferyard standards will
apply to all developments, other than one- and two-family dwellings. The
bufferyard requirement is determined by the difference between the zoning
district of the subject property and the zoning district of adjacent
properties. The specific requirements are identified in
Table 154.605.3. Bufferyards are required along only interior property lines
that abut another property and not along streets or rights-of-way.

Footnotes:
(1)   The intent of these provisions is to provide a visual break between
zoning districts and to buffer the less intensive district from various visual,
noise, odor, and other impacts potentially generated by the more intensive
district. Accordingly, the types of plant materials used and their locations
should be carefully chosen to mitigate these impacts on a year round basis.
 
   (G)    General landscaping and bufferyard requirements.
      (1)   Required landscape plan. All development required to provide
landscape or bufferyard areas under the provisions of this code shall provide a
detailed landscape plan showing the location and types of all proposed
landscaping and buffering materials. In addition, the plan should include
calculations for the landscaping plant types and points as required by this
section and calculations for those proposed.
      (2)   Cumulative requirements. All of the landscaping and bufferyard
requirements of this section shall be counted toward meeting the minimum
landscape surface area ratios of each zoning district. However, all minimum
landscaping and bufferyards shall be provided as required herein even if such
requirements exceed the minimum landscape surface area ratio of the applicable
zoning district.
      (3)   Calculating landscaping and bufferyard requirements. In calculating
the number of required landscaping points under the provisions of this section,
all areas and distances on which required calculations are based shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole number of square feet or linear feet. Any
partial plant derived from the required calculations of this section (for
example 23.3 shrubs) shall be rounded up to the nearest whole plant (24
shrubs).
      (4)   Overlapping provisions. In the event that the provisions of this
section specify two or more types of landscaping requirements for the same area
of a property (e.g. paved area requirement and bufferyard requirement) the
requirement specifying the greater number of plant materials and points shall
apply.
      (5)   Installation. Any and all landscaping and bufferyard material
required by the provisions of this code shall be installed on the subject
property in accordance with the approved plan within 180 days of the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy for any building on the subject property.
      (6)   Surety.
         (a)   If the subject property is to be occupied prior to the
installation of all required landscaping and bufferyard material, the property
owner shall sign an agreement stating the intent to install the landscaping
within the 180-day period. This agreement shall also contain a statement
indicating that there are fines associated with not complying with this
agreement.
         (b)   If a phase of development is approved per the requirements of
this code, required landscaping may be split into amounts which are applicable
to each phase.
         (c)   Governmental units to which these bond and guarantee provisions
apply may, in lieu of said contract or instrument of guarantee, file a
resolution or letter from officers authorized to act in its behalf agreeing to
comply with the provisions of this section.
      (7)   Existing plant material which meets the requirements of this
section and which will be preserved on the subject property following the
completion of development, may be counted as contributing to the landscaping
requirements.
      (8)   All required landscaping and bufferyard areas shall be covered with
a minimum of 75% of living plant material. In addition to the tree and shrub
requirements, areas shall be covered with lawn or native ground cover.
      (9)   The exact placement of required plants and structures as depicted
on the required detailed landscaping plan shall be the decision of each
property owner within the requirements of this section, except that the
following requirements shall be met:
         (a)   Evergreen shrubs shall be planted in clusters in order to
maximize their chance for survival.
         (b)   Where a combination of plant materials, and/or berming and/or
fencing is used in a bufferyard, the fence and/or berm shall be located toward
the interior of the subject property and the plant material shall be located
toward the exterior of the subject property.
         (c)   A property owner may establish through a written agreement,
recorded with the Jo Daviess County Recorder's Office, that states an adjacent
property owner shall agree to provide a partial or full portion of the required
bufferyard on an immediately adjacent portion of their land, thereby exempting
the developer from providing all or a portion of the bufferyard on his
property.
         (d)   In no manner shall landscaping or bufferyard materials be
selected and/or located in a manner that results in the creation of a safety or
visibility hazard.

SIGNAGE REGULATIONS
§ 154.801 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   There is a spirit and a quality about the city that is readily visible and
best described as being mid-1800's. It is reflected in the architecture in the
Historic District and it is very important that this quality be retained. Also
apparent is the rapid growth to the north and west of the city and the
evolution of commercial districts adjacent to Highway 20. Exterior signs are
important tools used to effectively advertise businesses and provide direction.
Signs have a clear impact on the character and quality of the city, thus the
development, implementation and enforcement of effective standards is
paramount. As a prominent part of the urban fabric, signs may attract or repel
the viewing public, affect the safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and
help set the character and legibility of neighborhoods in the city. It is
important to regulate signage and guide development to reinforce distinct
districts (i.e. as in the Historic District or Industrial Park). However, it is
equally important that signage contribute to a district's "sense of place" and
complement its surroundings, while setting a tone that is harmonious with the
city's existing natural, architectural and residential/urban setting. This
subchapter establishes minimum standards to promote life, health, safety,
welfare, convenience and enjoyment of the public by regulating the design,
quality of materials, construction, location and maintenance of all on- and
off-premise signs and advertising devices visible from the public right-of-way.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.802 OBJECTIVES.
   In accordance with state law, the regulations in this subchapter establish
comprehensive minimum requirements for the control of signs in order to
preserve, protect and promote the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare. More specifically, this subchapter is intended to assist in achieving
the following objectives:
   (A)   To authorize the use of street graphics which are:
      (1)   Compatible with their surroundings and the zoning district in which
they are located;
      (2)   Appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain;
      (3)   Expressive of the identity of the individual proprietors;
      (4)   Legible in the circumstances in which they are seen; and
      (5)   Expressive of the image the city desires to project.
   (B)   To foster high quality office, commercial and industrial development
and to enhance the economic vitality of existing businesses/industries by
promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of street graphics and
encouraging better communication with the public.
   (C)   To encourage sound sign display practices and to mitigate the
objectionable effects of competition in respect to the size and placement of
signs.
   (D)   To enhance the physical appearance of the city by protecting the man-
made and natural beauty of the area, and in particular, to further promote a
pedestrian oriented atmosphere along Main Street and the entire community.
   (E)   To protect pedestrians and motorists from any damage or injury that
might result from the improper construction, placement or use of signs.
   (F)   To protect the public investment in streets and highways by reducing
the obstructions and distractions which might cause traffic accidents.
   (G)   To preserve the value of private property by assuring the
compatibility of signs with nearby land uses.
   (H)   To protect the physical and mental well-being of the general public by
recognizing and encouraging a sense of aesthetic appreciation for the visual
environment.
   (I)   To preserve and enhance the natural beauty and unique character of the
city.
   (J)   To promote and aid in the tourist industry which is declared to be of
importance to the economy of the city.
   (K)   To promote convenience, enjoyment and free flow of traffic within the
city.
   (L)   To protect the public's ability to identify uses and premises without
confusion.

      (3)   No owner or user of an off-premises sign shall be permitted to
increase the total gross surface area of the sign without approval from the
Zoning Board of Appeals.

(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
   (B)   Official signs of the city (special use permit required). Signs along
U.S. Highway 20 are subject to both state and local control. In those areas
along U.S. Highway 20 which are not zoned for commercial or industrial use, the
state will issue a permit only upon application by the city for an official
sign. For this reason, the city shall make application to the state only when
certain and specific criteria are met by an applicant for a special use.
Official signs of the city shall be the only off-premises signs permitted in
those areas not zoned for commercial or industrial use which are clearly
visible from U.S. Highway 20.
      (1)   Standards of approval. Official signs which the City Council may
authorize through a special use permit shall comply with the following
standards:

of carrying out an official duty or responsibility.
         (b)   Sign must promote or give direction to a feature of historic
significance.
         (c)   Necessity for sign should be to relieve a hardship incurred by
reason of hard-to-find location.
         (d)   Sign should only feature services provided as opposed to goods
sold.
         (e)   Whatever is featured by sign should benefit travelers and/or
community as a whole (in contrast to the only benefit being to the sponsor of
the sign).
         (f)   The sign should not purely advertise a profit-making venture.
         (g)   The sign may purely advertise a not-for-profit venture (such as
a museum, church, park, and the like).
      (2)   Restrictions. The following restrictions shall be met for all
official city signs:
         (a)   No more than one official sign permitted per attraction or group
of attractions under common ownership or control.
         (b)   Once approved, no modifications of any kind, other than routine
maintenance, can be made to a sign without City Council approval.
         (c)   Colors and design must be sympathetic with the historical and
aesthetic qualities of the city and surrounding countryside.
         (d)   The City Council must approve the final design and placement and
all other matters, including ultimate removal of an official sign.
         (e)   Sign must comply with all other state and federal codes and
ordinances.
         (f)   Sign cannot obscure or interfere with other signage or traffic
in general.
         (g)   Sign cannot be placed upon rocks, trees or other natural
features.

      (1)   The area of an attached sign where the sign consists of words,
numerals or symbols painted on or affixed to a wall shall be the entire area
within a contiguous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of each word,
symbol, numeral, group of symbols, or groups of numerals, where the symbols or
numbers are meant to be read as a unit. Where there is a symbol that
encompasses or partly encompasses the message of the sign, the sign area shall
be the entire area within a contiguous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits
of the symbol.
      (2)   The area of a suspended, attached, or projecting sign, where the
letters, numerals, or symbols are on a sign surface which is hung or affixed to
a structure, shall be the total area of the hung or affixed surfaces.
      (3)   The area of a freestanding monument sign shall be the total area of
all surfaces (excluding poles) visible from the public right-of-way or other
point from which the sign is intended to be viewed. Only one display face shall
be measured in computing the total sign area where the sign faces are arranged
to be viewed one at a time.
      (4)   The area of a monument sign shall not include the surface area of
the base of the sign which is not designed to contain any copy area.
      (5)   The Zoning Administrator shall determine the area of any sign not
specifically provided for herein, according to the principles contained in this
section.
   (B)   The area of a wall sign limited to a percentage of a facade shall be
calculated as follows:
      (1)   The area of the facade is calculated by multiplying the width by
height of the facade. The height shall be measured by calculating the vertical
distance from grade to the top of the wall of a flat roof, or to the eave line
of a gable, hip, or gambrel roof.
      (2)   In cases where the height of the building cannot be determined the
average height shall be 12 feet per story.
      (3)   Signage shall be attached to the facade from which the sign area is
calculated. Facades may not be combined for the purposes of calculating sign
area.

kept in a state of safe working order at all times.
   (F)   All signs shall be designed to withstand a wind pressure of not less
than 80 miles per hour and shall be constructed to receive dead loads as
required in the Building Code or other ordinances of the city.

glass has an area exceeding three square feet it shall be wired glass.
   (I)   No sign shall be erected, placed or mounted in such a manner as to
interfere with snow removal or utility maintenance.
   (J)   All signs may be inspected periodically by the Zoning Administrator or
designee thereof for compliance with this and other codes of the city.
   (K)   No sign shall be erected, placed or mounted closer than ten feet to

by the Zoning Administrator or Building Official.
   (N)   All signs shall be mounted in one of the following manners:
      (1)   Flat against a building or wall.

showing to public view shall be painted and maintained a neutral color or a
color that blends with surrounding environment.
   (O)   All signs shall be constructed to not hold water, snow or ice.
   (P)   Although this subchapter establishes maximum sizes for various types
of signage, smaller signs may be required depending on the scale and balance
between the structure and the proposed sign.
   (Q)   Signs determined to be hazardous or potentially hazardous to property
or persons shall be removed or repaired by the owner thereof, or the person or
firm maintaining the sign, immediately upon written notice by the Zoning
Administrator. Signs which were installed, caused to be installed, erected,

In no case shall more than two events be promoted at one time.
   (F)   All event promoters, or a designee thereof, shall sign an
indemnification agreement, holding the city harmless for any damage or injury
caused through the process of hanging or removing the banners, and the city
shall not be held liable for any damage caused by the banners while being
displayed.

§ 154.906 ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW.
The following elements are common to all procedures unless modified by more
specific provisions.
   (A)   Time frames.  Time frames for action on the part of the city and
applicant are established as part of the administrative policies of the city, a
copy of which can be obtained from the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator may shorten any time frame specified therein.
   (B)   Pre-application conference.
      (1)   Purposes. The general purposes of a pre-application are to:
         (a)   Obtain a complete understanding of the proposed project and the
applicant's specific objectives.
         (b)   Identify all of the applicant's critical deadlines such as
property closing dates and preferred construction and operations dates.
         (c)   Identify all of the approvals necessary to construct the
proposed development.
         (d)   Identify all of the documents, plans, drawings, fees and other
materials necessary for a complete application.
         (e)   Identify the most significant issues that the development will
need to address in order to gain approval.
         (f)   Provide the applicant with direction on how to meet the
requirements of this code and other applicable regulations and policies.
      (2)   Applicability. 
Table 154.905.1 indicates the development permits for which a pre-application
conference is required or recommended. The Zoning Administrator may waive the
pre-application conference when in such administrator's discretion there is
substantial evidence to show that the purposes of this code can be met without
having to conduct such a conference.
      (3)   Application submittal requirements. Submittal requirements for
various types of development permits are established as part of the
administrative policies of the city, a copy of which can be obtained from the
Zoning Administrator. These requirements are typical for the type of project;
however, the scope or location of any specific development application may
require different types or levels of information. At the pre-application
conference, the Zoning Administrator shall determine what information shall be
submitted in order to provide for an adequate assessment of the project. At any
time during the processing of any application, additional information may be
required to respond to issues or concerns that may not have been evident at the
pre-application conference. Requirements and information from the pre-
application conference shall be recorded on a form supplied by the Zoning
Department and made part of the development file upon submittal of the
application.
   (C)   Application requirements.
      (1)   Materials. Lists of required application materials are available in
the Zoning Department. The lists may be picked up during normal business hours.
      (2)   Application deadlines. Schedules of application deadlines are
established by administrative policy and are available in the Zoning Department
during normal business hours.
      (3)   Application fees. The City Council sets fees in the amounts
sufficient to recover all or a portion of the costs of processing, publicizing,
and reviewing development applications. The City Council may, by the adoption
of a resolution: increase, decrease, or otherwise modify any of the fees set
forth. The most recent fee schedule, as adopted by the City Council, is
available from the Zoning Department during normal business hours.
      (4)   Completeness. The Zoning Administrator shall review the application
and determine if the application is complete for purposes of city staff and
agency review.
   (D)   Notice. Public notice is not required for most administrative permits.
Where notice is required, it shall be provided in accordance with the
following:
      (1)   Upon the Zoning Administrator's determination that an application
is complete, notice will be sent by the Zoning Administrator, at the
applicant's cost, by first class U.S. mail to each property owner within 250
feet of the property that is the subject of the application at the mailing
address listed in the official records of the Jo Daviess County Assessor.
      (2)   Mailed notice will provide a general description of the proposal,
the location of the property and the earliest date of which the Zoning
Administrator would make a decision regarding the application.
      (3)   Failure to receive mailed notice, if timely sent and prepared in
accordance with this section, shall not be grounds for invalidating any action
taken by the Zoning Administrator.
      (4)   This specific provision of this section notwithstanding, the Zoning
Administrator may provide public notice, in any form for any type of
development application, whenever in the opinion of such administrator such
notice will further the purpose and intent of this code.
      (5)   Notice shall be deemed to be complete when there is substantial
compliance with the requirements of this section. Minor technical deviations in
the language of published or mailed notice shall not be deemed to impair the
notice when notice has been given. The requirement for the number of days of
notice, for the general types of notices and for specifying the time, date and
place of a hearing and the general location of the property shall be strictly
construed; where there is a question raised at the hearing regarding the
adequacy of notice, the body conducting the hearing shall make a formal finding
as to whether there was substantial compliance with the notice requirement.
   (E)   Procedures.
      (1)   Staff review. Administrative applications shall be reviewed by city
staff and other appropriate agencies for compliance with city and agency codes
and policies. Upon completion of staff review, city staff will provide its
comments in writing to the applicant.
      (2)   Review by other agencies. City staff may forward copies of the
applications to various agencies for their review of the material submitted.

§ 154.919 NON-ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW COMMON ELEMENTS OF PROCEDURES.
   The following elements are common to all procedures unless otherwise
modified by more specific provisions.
   (A)   Timeframes. The timeframes for action on the part of the city are
established as part of the administrative policies of the city, a copy of which
can be obtained from the Zoning Administrator.
   (B)   Pre-application conference.
      (1)   Purposes. The general purposes of a pre-application are to:
         (a)   Obtain a complete understanding of the proposed project and the
applicant's specific objectives;
         (b)   Identify all of the approvals necessary to construct the
proposed development;
         (c)   Identify all of the documents, plans, drawings, fees and other
materials necessary for a complete application;
         (d)   Identify the most significant issues that the development will
need to address in order to gain approval; and
         (e)   Provide the applicant with direction on how to meet the
requirements of this code and other applicable codes, regulations and policies.
      (2)   Applicability. 
Table 154.918.1 indicates the development permits for which a pre-application
conference is required or recommended. The Zoning Administrator may waive the
pre-application conference when in such administrator's discretion there is
substantial evidence to show that the purposes of the code can be met without
having to conduct such a conference.
         (3)   Application submittal requirements.  Submittal requirements for
various types of development permits are available from the Zoning Department.
These requirements are typical for the type of approval required; however, the
scope of any specific development application may require different types or
levels of information. At the pre-application conference, the Zoning
Administrator shall determine what information shall be submitted in order to
provide for an adequate assessment of the project. At any time during the
processing of any application, additional information may be required to
address issues or concerns that may not have been evident at the pre-
application conference. Requirements and information from the pre-application
conference shall be recorded on a form supplied by the Department and made part
of the development file upon submittal of the application.
   (C)   Application requirements.
      (1)   Materials. Lists of required application materials are available in
the Zoning Department office. The lists may be picked up during normal business
hours.
      (2)   Application deadlines. Schedules of application deadlines are
established by administrative policy and are available in the Zoning Department
during normal business hours.
      (3)   Application fees. The City Council sets fees in amounts sufficient
to recover all or a portion of the costs of processing, publicizing and
reviewing development applications. The City Council may, by the adoption of a
resolution, increase, decrease, or otherwise modify any of the fees set forth.
The most recent fee schedule, as adopted by the City Council, is available from
the Zoning Department during normal business hours.
      (4)   Completeness. The Zoning Administrator shall review the application
and determine if the application is complete for purposes of city staff and
agency review.
   (D)   Neighborhood meeting.  The general purpose of a neighborhood meeting
is to produce a project that better meets the needs and desires of both the
developer and surrounding neighbors. The objective of the meeting is to find
areas of mutual agreement through an increased public understanding of a
proposed project and through dialogue between the developer and surrounding
neighbors about a project and its impacts. The recommendations for a
neighborhood meeting are established as part of the administrative policies of
the city, a copy of which can be obtained from the Zoning Administrator.
   (E)   Procedures.
      (1)   Staff review. Applications shall be reviewed by city staff and
other appropriate agencies for compliance with city and agency codes and
policies. Upon completion of staff review, city staff will provide its comments
in writing to the applicant.
      (2)   Review by other agencies. City staff may forward copies of the
applications to various agencies for their review of the material submitted.
These agencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   Other city departments;
         (b)   Telecommunication, gas, electric and other utilities;
         (c)   School districts;
         (d)   Law enforcement agencies;
         (e)   Fire departments or districts;
         (f)   Jo Daviess County staff, Zoning Board of Appeals, or Board
members;
         (g)   State agencies; and
         (h)   Federal agencies (e.g. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, etc.).
      (3)   Agency and department comments. Agencies will be asked to respond
in writing concerning the requested review. The agencies review will be
advisory in character, and does not constitute approval or disapproval. All
comments shall be forwarded to the applicant for response.
      (4)   Applicant's response. The applicant shall respond to staff and
agency comments in writing.
      (5)   Review of response. Upon receipt of the applicant's response to
comments, the Zoning Administrator shall determine if sufficient information
has been provided to schedule the application for a hearing. If the Zoning
Administrator deems the application insufficient for such purposes, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the informational
deficiencies.
   (F)   Notice.
      (1)   Purpose. Public hearings under this section and notice thereof
provide the opportunity for input in decisions that may affect the community.
Public participation ensures that decisions reflect consideration of the
community interest and ensure that the applicant and other interested parties
are given due process - the opportunity to be heard. Accordingly, nothing
herein shall prohibit the Zoning Administrator from providing public notice
that meets or exceeds these requirements for any type of development permit,
whenever he believes such notice will further the purposes and intent of this
code.
      (2)   Published notice.
         (a)   Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, in
any instance in which a public hearing is required, a notice setting forth the
date, time, place and purpose of such hearing, the general nature of the
request or matter to be heard, the name of the applicant and property owner,
and identification of the subject property must be published at least once in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city.
         (b)   With all other required application material, the applicant
shall either provide the information for the notice, or bear the cost of
collection, to the Zoning Administrator who shall be responsible for preparing
notice for publication.
      (3)   Mailed notice of public hearing.
         (a)   Mailed notice of a public hearing, when required by state law or
administrative policy of the city, shall be sent by the Zoning Administrator at
the applicant's cost by first class U.S. Mail. The notice shall be mailed to
each required property owner at the mailing address listed in the official
records of the Jo Daviess County, Illinois Assessor.
         (b)   The point at which the distance is measured for the mailed
notice shall begin at the property boundary line that completely encompasses
the subject proposal. The distance to affected properties shall be measured in
a straight line from the subject property boundary.
         (c)   Mailed notice shall state the date, time and place of the
hearing, a general description of the proposal, the location of the property
which is the subject of the hearing and other such requirements as further
specified in this code. The mailed notice must also include a statement
explaining that members of the public may be heard at the public hearing and
interested parties may cross-examine those testifying at the hearing. Newspaper
clippings of the published notice shall not be used for mailed notice. The
mailed notice shall be delivered by first class U.S. Mail.
         (d)   The failure of a property owner to receive notice by mail, if
timely sent and properly prepared in accordance with this section, shall not be
grounds for invalidating any action taken by the responsible decision-making
body.
      (4)   Combined notice. In instances where a proposed development requires
action on several development permits at the same hearing, the Zoning
Administrator may provide a single, combined notice for all actions to be
taken.
      (5)   Substantial compliance.  Notice shall be deemed to be complete when
there is substantial compliance with the requirements of this section. Minor
technical deviations in the language of published or mailed notice shall not be
deemed to impair the notice when notice has been given. The requirement for the
number of days of notice, for the general types of notices and for specifying
the time, date and place of a hearing and the general location of the property
shall be strictly construed; where there is a question raised at the hearing
regarding the adequacy of notice, the body conducting the hearing shall make a
formal finding as to whether there was substantial compliance with the notice
requirement.
   (G)   Request for a continuance prior to hearing.
      (1)   An applicant shall have the right to one continuance before the
Zoning Board of Appeals or public hearing, provided that a written request is
filed with the City Clerk at least five business days prior to the date of the
hearing being continued. If an application is not continued in this manner, the
right to a continuance shall be waived. There is no tacking of rights from
application to another. Additional continuances shall be per division (I)(5)
below.
      (2)   An applicant requesting a continuance shall make reasonable efforts
to notify all persons previously advised of the hearing that a continuance has
been requested. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to,
personal notice, broadcast or print media notice and any other form of notice
determined by the Zoning Administrator to be reasonable. The applicant shall
reimburse the city and provide all materials necessary to provide published and
mailed notice of the rescheduled public hearing date to surrounding property
owners in the same manner and in accordance with the same time schedule as for
the original date.
      (3)   The review body scheduled to conduct the hearing shall, upon
compliance with this section, grant the continuance to a time and date certain,
to be decided at its discretion. The hearing may be continued without being
opened for public testimony. Requests for additional continuances shall be
heard as per division (I)(4) below.
   (H)   Withdrawal of application. At any time prior to the hearing on an
application, the applicant may request in writing that the application be
withdrawal from consideration, subject to forfeiture of fees. After a hearing
is opened an applicant may request a withdrawal; however, the body conducting a
hearing shall decide whether or not to approve the request and may approve the
request either with or without prejudice.
   (I)   Public hearing procedures.
      (1)   Timing. When the Zoning Administrator determines that a development
permit application is sufficient to be scheduled for a public hearing, notice
of such hearing shall be made pursuant to division (F) above.
      (2)   Purpose of hearing. The purpose of a public hearing is to allow the
applicant and all other parties a reasonable and fair opportunity to be heard,
to present evidence relevant to the application, to rebut evidence presented by
others, and for interested parties, the additional opportunity to cross-examine
as permitted by law.
      (3)   Hearing body. Public hearings for non-administrative permits shall
be held as indicated on Table 154.915.1.
      (4)   Conduct of hearing.
         (a)   Any person or persons may appear at a public hearing and submit
evidence, either individually or via a representative. Each person who appears
at a public hearing shall state, for the record, his or her name, address, and
if appearing on behalf of an organization or group, the name and mailing
address of the organization or group. Persons claiming "interested party"
status shall so qualify and register with the city as per adopted
administrative policies, a copy of which can be obtained from the Zoning
Administrator.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator's report and recommendations shall be
made available prior to the public hearing. The Chair may direct that the
Zoning Administrator provide a summary presentation of the report and
recommendations.
         (c)   The Chair may exclude testimony or evidence that is irrelevant,
immaterial or unduly repetitious. Cross-examination of witnesses shall be
permitted as per the adopted administrative policies of the review body. At any
point, members of the body conducting the hearing may ask questions of the
applicant, staff or public.
      (5)   Continuance.
         (a)   Request for a continuance at the hearing. At any time prior to a
final decision, an applicant may request an application be continued for
further proceedings. In so doing, the applicant shall state the reasons of the
request. The granting or denial of a request for a continuance at this stage of
the process shall be at the sole discretion of the body conducting the hearing.
A majority vote of those members in attendance shall be required to grant a
continuance. The record shall reflect the reason(s) such continuance was
granted, any stipulations or conditions placed upon the continuance, and the
date and time at which the matter will be heard.
         (b)   Directed continuance. At any time prior to a final decision on a
request for a development permit, the Zoning Board of Appeals or City Council
may on its own motion continue a hearing. A majority vote of those members in
attendance shall be required to direct a continuance of an item. The record
shall reflect verbatim the reason(s) such continuance was granted, any
stipulations or conditions placed upon the continuance, and the date and time
at which the matter will be heard.
         (c)   Rules of construction. The provisions concerning requests for
continuances at a hearing and directed continuances shall be liberally
construed by the public body when the purpose or expected result of the
continuance is:
            1.   Increased efficiency in the development review process;
            2.   A reassessment of a design or a position;
            3.   Consideration or re-consideration of evidence in favor or
opposed to an application; and/or
            4.   Any other opportunity for the process to work toward the goal
of guiding and accomplishing coordinated and harmonious development of the city
and its environs.
         (d)   Purpose. The purpose of the section is to generally encourage
efficiency and to that end the legal issues of justifiability shall be de-
emphasized but not to the point of compromising fundamental fairness and due
process.
      (6)   Record of proceedings.
         (a)   The body conducting the hearing shall record the proceedings by
any appropriate means and according to such procedures as the city may, from
time to time, prescribe by administrative policies.
         (b)   The record of all proceedings, including testimony and
statements of personal opinions, the minutes of the secretary, all application,
exhibits and papers submitted, all staff and advisory body or commission
reports and recommendations, and the decision and report(s) of the body before
which the hearing is heard shall constitute the record.
      (7)   Additional rules. The body conducting the hearing may adopt rules
of procedure to limit the number of applications for development approval which
may be considered per meeting and to limit the time for each presentation, or
each speaker.
   (J)   Decision-making.
      (1)   Action.  As provided by this code, the acting body shall decide or
recommend: to approve, approve with conditions, or deny applications. The
acting bodies shall base decisions or recommendations on consideration of
evidence and analysis presented including, but not limited to, the following:
         (a)   Conformance with the code, the adopted Comprehensive Plan and
other adopted plans, overlay districts, standards and policies;
         (b)   Recommendations of staff and recommending bodies as applicable;
         (c)   Review agency input;
         (d)   Public input and testimony received at the hearing; and
         (e)   Effects of the proposal on the neighborhood, area, and
community-at-large.
      (2)   Authority to condition development approvals. After review of the
application, other pertinent documents and any evidence made part of the public
record, the recommending and decision-making bodies may impose conditions as
are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with applicable general or
specific standards stated in the code. The Zoning Administrator shall include a
copy of the conditions with the record of the decision. The applicant shall be
notified of any conditions imposed on the application.
      (3)   Zoning Board of Appeals as recommending body to City Council.  For
items that the Zoning Board of Appeals is the recommending body pursuant to
Table 154.918.1, a recommendation for denial shall require a two-thirds
affirmative vote of the City Council to be approved.
      (4)   Zoning Board of Appeals as decision-making body. The Zoning Board
of Appeals shall render final decision for items that the Zoning Board of
Appeals is the decision-making body pursuant to
Table 154.918.1.
      (5)   City Council. The City Council shall act upon applications pursuant
to
Table 154.918.1.
   (K)   Scope of action. The review body may take any action on an application
that is consistent with the notice given, including approval of the
application, conditional approval of the application or denial of the
application. The reviewing body may allow amendments to the application if the
effect of the amendments is to reduce the density or intensity of the original
application, reduce the impact of the development, or reduce the amount of land
involved from that indicated in the notices of the hearing. The reviewing body
may not, in any case, permit a greater amount of development, a more intensive
use, a larger land area than indicated in the original application, or a
greater variance than was indicated in the notice.
   (L)   Post-decision proceedings.
      (1)   Appeals. Any interested party aggrieved by a final decision by any
decision-maker may appeal the final action in accordance with the provisions of
§
154.926.
      (2)   Amendments and revisions to approval.
         (a)   Unless provided otherwise by this code, the Zoning Administrator
may approve minor revisions to an approved application. Minor revisions must be
authorized in writing by the Zoning Administrator and are subject to appeal to
the original final decision-maker. Authorized minor revisions are those that
are necessary in light of technical considerations that do not substantively
change the character of the development approval.
         (b)   If the Zoning Administrator determines that a requested revision
is not minor, approval of the revision by the original final decision-maker is
required in accordance with the procedures established for the original
consideration of the application.
   (M)   Validity.
      (1)   Time of expiration. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in
this code, development approvals shall expire and become null and void, all
activities taken pursuant to such approved development applications shall
cease, and all activities pursuant to such approval thereafter shall be deemed
in violation of this code, when:
         (a)   The applicant fails to satisfy any condition that was imposed as
part of the original or revised approval of the development application, or
that was made pursuant to the terms of any development agreement application,
including the failure to abide by specified time limits established therein; or
         (b)   The applicant fails to present a subsequent development
application as required by this code within the time so required or as may be
required by the Illinois Compiled Statutes. If no time limit for satisfaction
of conditions is specified in the original or revised approval of the
development application, the time shall be presumed to be one year from the
date of approval.
      (2)   Extension procedures.
         (a)   Considerations. Unless otherwise prohibited by Illinois law or
this code, an extension of the effective period of the development approval
and/or development phasing schedule may be granted by the decision-making body
granting the original approval. In deciding a request for an extension, the
decision-making body shall consider: whether the applicant has demonstrated
sufficient cause as to why the original effective period or development phasing
schedule cannot be met; and whether development regulations applicable to the
project have not or are not proposed to be materially changed so as to render
the project inconsistent with the regulations prevailing at the time the
extension would expire.
         (b)   Requests. Requests for an extension of the effective period of
the development approval or development phasing schedule shall be submitted in
writing to the Zoning Administrator prior to the expiration of the original
approval. Upon receipt of the request, the Zoning Administrator shall schedule
the matter before the decision-making body.
   (N)   Continued compliance. Once constructed and occupied, a development
shall continue to provide all necessary maintenance and/or replacement in order
to remain in substantial compliance with all approved plans and conditions of
approval. Failure to remain in substantial compliance, including the
replacement of required plant materials that have died or are diseased, shall
constitute a violation of this code.
   (O)   Revocation of permit or approval.
      (1)   Duties of Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator
determines that there are reasonable grounds for revocation of a development
permit or approval, other than those provided in division (M) above, the Zoning
Administrator shall set a hearing before the final decision-maker. If the
decision was made by the Zoning Administrator, the hearing shall be conducted
by the Zoning Board of Appeals. If the City Council was the original decision-
maker, it may refer the proposed revocation to the Zoning Board of Appeals for
a recommendation prior to the hearing.
      (2)   Notice and public hearing. Notice of the revocation hearing shall
be given in the same manner as required for the original application. A public
hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures of this section.
      (3)   Notification of appeal or revocation. Whenever an appeal is taken
from a final decision, or whenever the city determines to revoke a development
permit which was obtained following a public hearing, mailed notice of the
appeal or revocation shall be prepared and made in the manner prescribed for
the original action. If no public hearing was held prior to obtaining the
development permit, mailed notice of revocation shall be given to the holder of
the permit only.
      (4)   Decision and notice. After the conclusion of the hearing, the
decision-maker shall render a decision to revoke the permit, to allow the
applicant to retain the development permit, or reconsider the permit and shall
notify the holder of the permit and any other person who has filed a written
request for such notice.
      (5)   Effect and appeals. Unless specified otherwise at the time of the
decision, a decision to revoke a development permit shall become final
immediately at the time the decision is rendered, unless appealed. After such
effective date of revocation, any activities continuing pursuant to such permit
shall be deemed to be in violation of the code.
      (6)   Right cumulative. The city's right to revoke a development permit,
as provided in this section, shall be cumulative to any other remedy allowed by
law.
   (P)   City initiated requests. The City Administrator, Zoning Administrator,
Zoning Board of Appeals, or City Council may initiate a request for any
development permit on behalf of th city. Such requests shall not be subject to
fees, but shall otherwise follow the same procedures established in this code.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.920 ZONING CODE AMENDMENT AND REZONING.
   (A)   Purpose. In order to maintain internal consistency within this code

consistent with the purposes stated herein.
   (B)   Applicability. All proposed amendments to the text of this code and
zoning map shall comply with the provisions of this section.
   (C)   Approval criteria. In determining whether the proposed amendment shall
be approved, the following factors shall be considered:
         (1)   Whether the existing text or zoning designation was in error at
the time of adoption;
         (2)   Whether there has been a change of character in the area or
throughout the city due to installation of public facilities, other zone
changes, new growth trends, deterioration, development transitions, etc.;
         (3)   Whether the proposed rezoning is compatible with the surrounding
area and defining characteristics of the proposed zoning district or whether
there may be adverse impacts on the capacity or safety of the portion of street
network influenced by the rezoning, parking problems, or environmental impacts
that the new zone may generate such as excessive storm water runoff, water, air
or noise pollution, excessive nighttime lighting, or other nuisances;
         (4)   Whether the proposal is in conformance with and in furtherance
of the implementation of the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan,
other adopted plans, and the policies, intents and requirements of this code,
and other city regulations and guidelines;
         (5)   Whether adequate public facilities and services are available or
will be made available concurrent with the projected impacts of development in
the proposed zone;
         (6)   Whether there is an adequate supply of land available in the
subject area and the surrounding community to accommodate the zoning and
community needs; or
         (7)   Whether there is a need in the community for the proposal and
whether there will be benefits derived by the community or area by the proposed
rezoning.
   (D)   Decision-maker. The Zoning Administrator and Zoning Board of Appeals
shall make recommendations and the City Council shall take final action.
      (1)   When the Zoning Board of Appeals or City Council deems it necessary
or expedient, additional property in the zoning district may be considered for
a zoning change provided that this additional property is also addressed in the
public hearing notice, in accordance with §
154.919(F).
      (2)   In the event of a written protest against a proposed amendment
signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% of the frontage proposed to be
altered or by the owners of 20% of the frontage immediately adjoining or across
the alley or rear line therefrom or by the owners of 20% of the frontage
directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered as to such regulations or
zoning district and field with the City Clerk, such amendment shall not be
passed except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all of the selected
members of the City Council.
   (E)   Application and review procedures. Application requirements and
processing procedures are those described in
Table 154.918.1 and §
154.919 with the following modifications:

criteria as listed in division (C) above.
      (2)   Notice. Mailed Notice. A rezoning request relating to more than 5%
of the entire incorporated area of the city and all text amendment requests
shall not require mailed notice to any property owner. Instead, the Zoning
Administrator shall purchase a quarter-page display advertisement in a local
newspaper of general circulation. The content and timing of said advertisement
shall follow the published notice provisions of §
154.919(F).
      (3)   Resubmittal of application. No application which has been denied
wholly or in part by the City Council shall be resubmitted for a period of one
year from the date of the denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of
changed conditions found to be valid by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.921 CONCEPT PLAN.
   (A)   Purpose. The concept plan review is an optional process that may
provide an applicant with a general, non-binding direction from the Zoning
Board of Appeals prior to submittal of a development application. Although it
is the intent of this process to be as helpful as possible to an applicant in
designing a proposed project, applicants should not rely on the direction as an
indication of any future decision-making by the Zoning Board of Appeals on any
subsequent requests for development permits. The city explicitly disclaims any
direction or the outcome of any future decision-making.
   (B)   Applicability. A concept plan review may be requested for any type of
development that requires a recommendation or final action by the Zoning Board
of Appeals.
   (C)   Review criteria. The concept plan shall be evaluated using the
criteria required for the type of development. The ability of the Zoning Board
of Appeals to apply the criteria may be limited based on the amount of
information provided with the application.
   (D)   Decision-maker. The individual members of the Zoning Board of Appeals
may provide any and all comments, questions, critiques and direction they deem
appropriate to assist the applicant with preparing a subsequent application for
a development permit. These comments are strictly advisory and should not be
taken as an indication of how the individual members or Zoning Board of Appeals
as a whole may vote on any subsequent application for a development permit. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall not take a formal vote on any portion of the
concept plan.
   (E)   Application and review procedures. Application requirements and
processing procedures are those described in
Table 154.918.1 and §
154.919 with the following modifications:
      (1)   Staff review, report and recommendations.  The Zoning Administrator
shall not be required to review the plan, circulate the plan to other agencies,
produce a report, or make recommendations but may do any or all of these at
said Administrator's discretion.
      (2)   Notice. Notice is not required unless requested by the applicant.
Requested notice shall be the same as that required for the development permits
necessary to allow the proposed type of development.
      (3)   Appeal. Because there is no decision, there is no appeal of any
direction given by the Zoning Board of Appeals; however, in its discretion,
City Council may elect to provide direction of its own on any concept plan.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.922 NON-ADMINISTRATIVE HIGHWAY 20 DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of a Highway 20 development permit is to ensure
compliance with the goals and objectives of the Highway 20 Corridor Design
Manual adopted in §
154.303.
   (B)   Applicability. The standards and regulations contained in the Design
Manual apply to all development activities (including everything from grading
and filling, to paving, to new construction and additions, to all new principal
and major and minor accessory structures and additions thereto) within 2,400
feet of the Highway 20 centerline (as it exists at the time development is
proposed). No development covered by the Design Manual may be undertaken
without first obtaining approval of a Highway 20 development permit as required
in Chapter
X of the Design Manual. Depending on the type and magnitude of a proposed
development project, the Highway 20 development permit may be acted upon by
either the Zoning Administrator, Zoning Board of Appeals or City Council.
Please see Table X.1 in Chapter
X of the Design Manual for a list of those development projects which must be
approved non-administratively.
   (C)   Review criteria. The application shall demonstrate that the proposed
development will comply with the following:
      (1)   All applicable site plan review criteria in §
154.914;
      (2)   The overall context of the corridor and the goals for new
development as described in Chapter
III of the Design Manual;
      (3)   The corridor development concepts described in Chapter
IV of the Design Manual;
      (4)   The proposed character of the applicable design districts as
described in Chapter
V of the Design Manual;
      (5)   The proposed pattern of development for the Highway 20 Corridor as
described in Chapter
VI of the Design Manual;
      (6)   The standards for building orientation, design and materials as
described in Chapter
VII of the Design Manual; and
      (7)   The standards for site features and elements as described in
Chapter
VII of the Design Manual.
   (D)   Decision-maker. For those development projects assigned to the Zoning
Board Appeals and City Council for final action in Table X.1 of the Design
Manual, the appropriate decision-maker shall approve, conditionally approve, or
deny all applications for a Highway 20 development permit. The Zoning
Administrator may defer acting on an application to the Zoning Board of Appeals
where the Administrator believes the purpose and goals of the Design Manual
would best be met by having a public hearing on the development proposal.
   (E)   Application and review procedures. Application requirements and
processing procedures are described in
Table 154.918.1 and §
154.919.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.923 PUD/TND REZONING AND PLAN REVIEW.
   (A)   Purpose. Planned Unit Development (PUD) and Traditional Neighborhood
Development (TND) districts are intended to apply to mixed use or unique single
use projects to provide design flexibility not available through strict
application and interpretation of the standards established in §§
154.201 through
154.209. The purpose of the PUD/TND zones is to provide design flexibility as
described in §§
154.301 through
154.303. PUD/TND rezonings should be used only when long-term community
benefits that may be achieved through high quality development will be derived.
Long term community benefits include without limitation:
      (1)   More efficient infrastructure;
      (2)   Reduced traffic demands;
      (3)   A greater quality and quantity of public and/or private open space;
      (4)   Other recreational amenities;
      (5)   Needed housing types and/or mix;
      (6)   Innovative designs; and/or
      (7)   Protection and/or preservation of natural resources.
   (B)   Outline Development Plan (ODP). The purpose of an ODP is to
demonstrate conformance with the Comprehensive Plan, compatibility of land use
and coordination of improvements within and among individually platted parcels,
sections or phases of a development prior to the approval of a preliminary
plan. At ODP, the proposed zoning for the entire property or for each pod
designated for development on the plan is established. This step is recommended
for larger, more diverse projects that are expected to be developed over a long
period of time. Through this process, the general pattern of development is
established with a range of densities and intensities assigned to individual
pods that will be the subject of future, more detailed planning.
      (1)   Applicability.  An outline development plan is an optional, but
encouraged first step prior to an application for a preliminary development
plan for a parcel of at least 20 acres.
      (2)   Approval criteria.  An ODP application shall demonstrate
conformance with all of the following:
         (a)   The Comprehensive Plan, Major Street Plan and other adopted
plans and policies;
         (b)   The rezoning criteria provided in §
154.920(C);
         (c)   The PUD/TND requirements of §§
154.301 through
154.303;
         (d)   The applicable corridor guidelines and other overlay districts;
         (e)   Adequate public services and facilities being provided
concurrent with the projected impacts of the development;
         (f)   Adequate circulation and access being provided to serve all
development pods/areas to be developed;
         (g)   Appropriate screening and buffering of adjacent property and
uses being provided;
         (h)   An appropriate range of intensity/density of uses for the entire
property or for each development pod/area to be developed;
         (i)   An appropriate set of default or minimum standards for the
entire property or for each development pod/area to be developed;
         (j)   An appropriate phasing or development schedule for the entire
property or for each development pod/area to be developed.
      (3)   Decision-maker. The Zoning Administrator and Zoning Board of
Appeals shall make recommendations and the City Council shall approve,
conditionally approve, or deny all applications for an ODP.
      (4)   Application and review procedures. Application requirements and
processing procedures are described in
Table 154.918.1 and §
154.919, with the following modifications:
         (a)   Simultaneous review of other plans. An applicant may file an ODP
with a preliminary development plan, as determined by the Zoning Administrator
at the pre-application conference.
         (b)   Validity. The effective period of the ODP/phasing schedule shall
be determined concurrent with ODP approval.
         (c)   Required subsequent approvals. Following approval of an ODP, a
preliminary development plan approval and a subsequent final development plan
approval shall be required before any development activity can occur.
   (C)   Preliminary development plan.
      (1)   Applicability.
         (a)   Approved ODP.  If the property has an approved ODP, the purpose
of the preliminary development plan is to ensure consistency with the uses,
density/intensity, bulk, performance, and other standards of the approved ODP
and proposed PUD or TND rezoning ordinance for the specific area included in
the preliminary plan. Unless specified otherwise with the ODP, the applicant
shall have the option of proposing either a PUD/TND district or a PUD/TND site.
Typically, the PUD/TND rezoning ordinance is acted upon at this stage
concurrent with action on the preliminary plan. However, should the City
Council find that a preliminary plan lacks sufficient detail to ensure that
future development will be of the intensity and quality proposed by the
applicant and as envisioned by the City Council, it may defer action on the PUD
rezoning ordinance until the final plan stage.
         (b)   No approved ODP. If the property has no approved ODP, the
purpose of this stage is to answer the question, "Should this use, with this
specific intensity/density, designed in this particular manner, be constructed
on this site?" In designing the plan, the applicant shall have the option of
proposing either a PUD/TND district or a PUD/TND site. Typically, the PUD/TND
rezoning ordinance is acted upon at this stage concurrent with action on the
preliminary plan. However, should the City Council find that a proposed
preliminary plan lacks sufficient detail to ensure that future development will
be of the intensity and quality proposed by the applicant and as envisioned by
the City Council, it may defer action on the PUD/TND rezoning ordinance until
the final plan stage.
      (2)   Review criteria. A preliminary development plan application shall
demonstrate conformance with all of the following:
         (a)   The ODP review criteria in division (B) above;
         (b)   The applicable preliminary plat criteria in
Chapter 153, Subdivision Regulations;
         (c)   The applicable site plan review criteria in §
154.914;
         (d)   The approved ODP, if applicable;
         (e)   An appropriate, specific density/intensity of uses for all areas
included in the preliminary plan approval; and
         (f) For a PUD/TND District, the area of the plan is at least five
acres in size or as specified in an applicable approved ODP, or as identified
in §
154.301.
      (3)   Decision-maker. The Zoning Administrator and Zoning Board of
Appeals shall make recommendations and the City Council shall approve,
conditionally approve, or deny all applications for a preliminary development
plan and, at its discretion, the accompanying PUD/TND rezoning ordinance.
      (4)   Application and review procedures. Application requirements and
processing procedures are described in
Table 154.918.1 and §
154.919, with the following modifications:
         (a)   Concurrent review of the PUD/TND rezoning ordinance. The
rezoning ordinance shall be considered concurrently with the preliminary plan.
However, should the City Council find that a proposed district or site lacks
sufficient detail to ensure that future development will be of the intensity
and quality proposed by the applicant and envisioned by the City Council, it
may defer action on the PUD/TND rezoning ordinance until the final plan stage.
         (b)   Required concurrent review of subdivision.  A preliminary plat
shall be submitted and reviewed concurrently with a preliminary development
plan.
         (c)   Density/intensity transfer. If the property has an approved ODP,
density/intensity of uses may not be transferred between development pods/areas
to be developed unless explicitly provided for with the ODP approval or by
amending the OPD in the same manner as originally approved.
         (d)   Validity. The effective period of the preliminary development
plan shall be as determined by the ODP approval, if applicable, or at the time
of preliminary plan approval.
         (e)   Required subsequent approvals. Following approval of a
preliminary development plan, final development plan approval shall be required
before any development activity can occur.
   (D)   Final development plan.
      (1)   Applicability. The final development plan and final subdivision
plat where applicable, the blueprint for development of a PUD/TND project. The
plan and the plat ensure consistency with the approved preliminary development
plan and specific development and constructions requirements of various adopted
codes. No building permit shall be issued until final plan approval is
obtained.
      (2)   Review criteria. A final development plan application shall
demonstrate conformance with all of the following:
         (a)   The approved ODP, if applicable;
         (b)   The approved preliminary development plan;
         (c)   The approved preliminary plat;
         (d)   The approved PUD/TND rezoning ordinance;
         (e)   All other applicable development and construction codes,
ordinances, and policies;\
         (f)   The applicable site plan review criteria in §
154.914; and
         (g)   The applicable final plat criteria in
Chapter 153, Subdivision Regulations.
      (3)   Decision-maker. The Zoning Administrator shall make a
recommendation and the Zoning Board of Appeals shall approve, conditionally
approve, or deny all applications for a final development plan, unless the City
Council in its discretion required the final plan be returned to it for final
action. In such cases, the Zoning Administrator and Zoning Board of Appeals
shall provide recommendations concerning the final plan.
      (4)   Application and review procedures. Application requirements and
processing procedures shall comply with those described in
Table 154.918.1 and §
154.919, with the following modifications:
         (a)   Concurrent review of PUD/TND rezoning ordinance. If the rezoning
ordinance was not acted upon at the preliminary stage, it shall be acted upon
concurrently with the final plan review. A final plan shall not be valid unless
and until a corresponding PUD/TND rezoning ordinance has been approved.
         (b)   Required concurrent review of subdivision. Unless specified
otherwise at the time of preliminary plan approval, if the form of preliminary
plan approval was a site development plan, a final plat shall be submitted and
reviewed concurrently with a final development plan; if the form of preliminary
plan approval was a subdivision plan, a final plat may be approved and recorded
prior to final plan approval.
         (c)   Review of covenants. The City Attorney shall review and approve
all covenants and restrictions in the best interests of the City, as determined
in the City Attorney's exercise of independent professional judgment prior to
final development plan approval.
         (d)   Form of final action. If the final development plan is approved
by the Zoning Board of Appeals, the surveyor or engineer shall then make any
changes necessary or required to comply with final approval conditions.
         (e)   Recording. Upon final approval, the plan and plat shall be
recorded. The final plat shall, at a minimum, contain all of the following
information which is pertinent to the PUD/TND the setbacks; a list of approved
and/or specifically excluded uses; and any pertinent conditions or stipulations
which were previously made or imposed.
   (E)   Guarantees for public improvements. Except as provided herein, before
the plan and plat are recorded, all applicants shall be required to complete,
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator and City engineer, all street,
sanitary, and other public improvements, as well as lot improvements on the
individual lots of the subdivision as required by this code. The required
improvements shall be those specified in the approved construction plans as per
the final subdivision approval. As a condition of final plan and plat approval,
the city may permit the applicant to enter into a development improvements
agreement and post a guarantee for the completion of all required improvements
as per the Subdivision Code.
   (F)   Amendments to approved plans.
      (1)   PUD/TND rezoning ordinance. The use, density/intensity, bulk
performance and default standards contained in an approved PUD/TND rezoning
ordinance may be amended only as follows, unless specified otherwise in the
rezoning ordinance:
         (a)   No use may be established that is not permitted in the PUD/TND
without amending the rezoning ordinance through the rezoning process. Uses may
be transferred between development pods/areas to be developed through an
amendment to the ODP and/or preliminary development plan, as applicable,
provided the overall density/intensity for the entire PUD/TND is not exceeded.
         (b)   The maximum and minimum density/intensity for the entire PUD/TND
shall not be exceeded without amending the rezoning ordinance through the
rezoning process. Density/intensity may be transferred between development
pods/areas to be developed through an amendment to the ODP and/or preliminary
development plan, as applicable, provided the overall density/intensity for the
entire PUD/TND is not exceeded.
         (c)   The bulk, performance and default standards may not be amended
for the entire PUD/TND or an entire development pod/area to be developed
without amending the PUD/TND rezoning ordinance through the rezoning process.
The bulk default standards may be varied on individual lots within the PUD/TND
through an amendment to the preliminary development plan.
      (2)   Outline development plan. The approved outline development plan may
be amended only with the approval of the City Council through the same process
by which it was approved, unless the adopted PUD/TND rezoning ordinance
provides otherwise. All subsequent preliminary development plans and final
development plans must be consistent with the approved outline development plan
and rezoning ordinance.
      (3)   Preliminary development plan. Unless the adopted PUD/TND rezoning
ordinance provides otherwise, the approved preliminary development plan may be
amended as follows:
         (a)   Minor amendments. The Zoning Administrator may approve the
following amendments for individual lots within the area covered by a
preliminary development plan provided all standards in the adopted PUD/TND
rezoning ordinance are met:
            1.   Decreases in density and/or intensity so long as the character
of the site is maintained;
            2.   Increases in gross floor area of up to 10% so long as the
character of the site is maintained;
            3.   Changes in the location and type of landscaping and/or
screening so long as the character and intent of the original design are
maintained;
            4.   Changes in the orientation or location of parking areas and
vehicular and pedestrian circulation areas so long as the effectiveness and
character of the overall site circulation, parking and parking lot screening
are maintained;
            5.   The reorientation, but not complete relocation, of major
structures so long as the character of the site is maintained; and.
            6.   Changes in building design and materials so long as the
character and intent of the original design are maintained.
         (b)   Major amendments applicable to only one lot. Any change not
listed above as a minor amendment to an individual lot shall be deemed a major
amendment. Such amendments shall be reviewed by the Zoning Board of Appeals and
decided by the City Council using the same process as the preliminary
development plan but with the following review criteria:
            1.   Only the bulk or performance standards may be varied;
            2.   The applicable variance review criteria in §
154.925; and;
            3.   The amendment shall not represent a significant unilateral
change in any of the agreed upon deviations from the default standards.
         (c)   Major amendments applicable to more than one lot. All other
amendments to the preliminary development plan shall be reviewed by the Zoning
Board of Appeals and decided by the City Council using the same process and
criteria used for preliminary plan review and approval.
      (4)   Final development plan. Amendments to the final development plan
shall be decided by the Zoning Board of Appeals using the same process and
criteria used for final development plan and review and approval.
   (G)   Lapse of plan and rezone.
      (1)   If a planned unit development, or any portion thereof, has not been
completed in accordance with the approved development schedule, a "lapse" shall
have occurred and the terms of all approved plans for incomplete portions of
the PUD/TND shall be null and void. If a lapse occurs, the property shall be
governed by the zoning district applied to the property immediately before the
rezoning to PUD/TND, or an applicant may request a hearing before the Zoning
Board of Appeals at which time a revocation of all prior approvals shall be
considered. If the Zoning Board of Appeals determines that a lapse has
occurred, the Zoning Administrator shall record an appropriate legal notice.
The Zoning Administrator may, if he deems appropriate, initiate, without owner
consent, a zoning change on a lapsed PUD/TND to another zone district.
      (2)   The above notwithstanding, the Zoning Administration may, in said
Administrator's discretion, permit a single six-month extension to any part of
or the entire approved development schedule.
   (H)   General provisions.
      (1)   Contractual agreement.  Approval of a PUD/TND allows the
development and use of a parcel of land under certain, specific conditions. No
use of the parcel, nor construction, modification, or alteration of any use or
structures within a PUD/TND project shall be permitted unless such
construction, modification or use complies with the terms and conditions of an
approved final development plan. Each subsequent owner and entity created by
the developer, such as property owner's associations or an architectural review
committee, shall comply with the terms and conditions of approval. The
developer shall set forth the conditions of approval within the subdivision
covenants. Such covenants shall be recorded with the final approved plan and
plat.
      (2)   Transfer of ownership. No person shall sell, convey, or transfer
ownership of any property or any portion thereof within a planned unit
development zone until such person has informed the buyer of the property's
status with respect to the planned unit development process and conditions of
approval. The city shall bear no liability for any person's misrepresentation
of terms and conditions of an existing approval.
      (3)   Planned unit development zone designation.  The Zoning
Administrator shall designate each approved PUD/TND on the official zoning map.
(Ord. O-5-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.924 SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of a special use review is to provide an
opportunity to utilize property for an activity, which under usual
circumstances, could be detrimental to other permitted uses and which normally
is not permitted within the same district. A special use may be permitted under
circumstances particular to the proposed location and subject to conditions
that provide protection to adjacent land uses. A special use is not a use by-
right and one that is otherwise prohibited without approval of a special use
permit.
   (B)   Applicability. A special use permit shall be required prior to the
establishment of any special use identified in §§
154.401 through
154.407 or elsewhere in this code.
   (C)   Review criteria. The application shall demonstrate that the proposed
development will comply with the following:
      (1)   Site plan review standards. All applicable site plan review
criteria in §
154.914.
      (2)   District standards. The underlying zoning district standards
established in §§
154.201 through
154.209 including the defining characteristics of the district;
      (3)   Specific standards. The land use regulations established in §
154.405;
      (4)   Availability of complementary uses. Other uses complementary to,
and supportive of, the proposed project shall be available including, but not
limited to: schools, parks, hospitals, business and commercial facilities, and
transportation facilities.
      (5)   Compatibility with adjoining properties. Compatibility with and
protection of neighboring properties through measures such as:
         (a)   Protection of privacy. The proposed plan shall provide
reasonable visual and auditory privacy for all dwelling units located within
and adjacent to the site. Fences, walls, barriers and/or vegetation shall be
arranged to protect and enhance the property and to enhance the privacy of on-
site and neighboring occupants;
         (b)   Protection of use and enjoyment. All elements of the proposed
plan shall be designed and arranged to have a minimal negative impact on the
use and enjoyment of adjoining property.
         (c)   Compatible design and integration. All elements of a plan shall
coexist in a harmonious manner with nearby existing and anticipated
development. Elements to consider include: buildings, outdoor storage areas and
equipment, utility structures, building and paving coverage, landscaping,
lighting, glare, dust, signage, views, noise, and odors. The plan must ensure
that noxious emissions and conditions not typical of land uses in the same
zoning district will be effectively confined so as not to be injurious or
detrimental to nearby properties.
   (D)   Decision-maker. The Zoning Administrator shall make recommendations
and the Zoning Board of Appeals shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny
all applications for a special use permit.
   (E)   Application and review procedures. Application requirements and
processing procedures are described in
Table 154.918.1 and §
154.919, with the following modification:
      (1)   Validity. Once established, a special use permit approval shall run
with the land and remain valid until the property changes use or the use is
abandoned and non-operational for a period of 12 consecutive months.
(Ord. O-05-04, passed 4-11-05)
§ 154.925 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Purpose. A variance is a departure from the dimensional or numerical
requirements of this code where such variance will not be contrary to the
public interest and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not
as a result of the action of the applicant, a literal enforcement of this code
would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. Variances are permitted only to
those portions of this code as specified herein.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   As per §
154.917, the Zoning Administrator shall decide all requests for administrative
waivers of up to 10% for the setback standards included on Tables
154.202.1,
154.203.1,
154.204.1, and
154.205.1.
      (2)   In accordance with this section, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
hear and decide all requests for variances to all of the bulk standards
included on Tables
154.202.1,
154.203.1,
154.204.1, and
154.205.1, except for:
         (a)   Minimum lot area; and
         (b)   Minimum lot width and minimum street frontage.
      (3)   In accordance with this section, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
hear and decide all requests for variances to the residential density standards
and nonresidential intensity standards included on Tables
154.207.1 and
154.208.1, respectively, except for:
         (a)   Maximum gross density (
Table 154.207.1);
         (b)   Maximum building size without a special use approval (
Table 154.208.1); and
         (c)   Maximum building size (
Table 154.208.1).
      (4)   In accordance with this section, the City Council shall hear and
decide all requests for variances to the following lot area and dimension
standards included on Tables
154.202.1 and
154.204.1 as part of preliminary plat approval.
         (a)   Minimum lot area; and
         (b)   Minimum lot width and minimum street frontage.
      (5)   In accordance with this section the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
hear and decide all requests for variances to the following, unless other
variance provisions are specifically provided for otherwise elsewhere in this
code:
         (a)   The nonconforming lot, use, and site and structure regulations
contained in §§
154.201 through 209;
         (b)   Land use specific regulations contained in §§
154.401 through
154.407;
         (c)   The natural resource protection standard contained in §§

154.510;
         (d)   The parking, lighting, and landscaping standards contained in §§
154.601 through
154.605;
         (e)   The general performance standards contained in §§
154.701 through
154.713; and
         (f)   The sign regulations contained in §§
154.801 through 154.815.
      (6)   Under no circumstances shall variances be heard or granted for the
following:
         (a)   The establishment of a use in a district in which such use is
not permitted by this code;
         (b)   Residential development which would result in a maximum gross
density that is greater than that permitted in the applicable zoning district;
         (c)   Nonresidential development which would result in a maximum
building size that is greater than that permitted in the applicable zoning
district;
         (d)   Changes or modifications to any definition contained in this
code;
         (e)   Changes in use of or expansion of a new conforming use beyond
those permitted in §§
154.101 through
154.110.
   (C)   Approval criteria. A variance is not a right. It may be granted to an
applicant only if the applicant establishes that strict adherence to this code
will result in practical difficulties or undue hardships because of site
characteristics that are not applicable to most properties in the same zoning
district. Such variances shall be granted only when the applicant establishes
that all of the following criteria, as applicable, are satisfied:
      (1)   Hardship unique to property, not self-inflicted. There are
exceptional conditions creating an undue hardship, applicable only to the
property involved or the intended use thereof, which do not apply generally to
the other land areas or uses within the same zone district, and such
exceptional conditions or undue hardship was not created by the action or
inaction of the applicant or owner of the property;
      (2)   Special privilege.  The variance will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied to other lands or structures in the same
zoning district;
      (3)   Literal interpretation. The literal interpretation of the
provisions of the regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly
enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district and would work
unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant;
      (4)   Reasonable use.  The applicant and the owner of the property can
not derive a reasonable use of the property without the requested variance;
      (5)   Minimum necessary. The variance is the minimum necessary to make
possible the reasonable use of land or structures;
      (6)   Compatible with adjacent properties. The variance will not be
injurious to, or reduce the value of, the adjacent properties or improvements
or be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare. In granting a
variance, the decision-maker may impose conditions deemed necessary to protect
affected property owners and to protect the intent of this code;
      (7)   Conformance with the purposes of this code. The granting of a
variance will not conflict with the purposes and intents expressed or implied
in this Code; and
      (8)   Conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.  The granting of a
variance will not conflict with the goals and principles in the adopted
Comprehensive Plan.
   (D)   Decision-maker. The Zoning Administrator shall make recommendations
and the appropriate decision maker as described in division (B) above, shall
approve, approve with conditions, or deny requests for variances.
   (E)   Application and review procedures. Application requirements and
processing procedures are described in
Table 154.918.1 and §
154.919.

APPENDIX A LIGHTING STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS

What is good lighting?
Good outdoor lights improve visibility, safety, and a sense of security, while
minimizing energy use, operating costs, and undesirable glare.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ea11130414a5766f7589ffc547d4d5bc7c948ae0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-7258.jpg]
 
Why should we be concerned?
Many outdoor lights are poorly designed or improperly aimed. Such lights are
costly, wasteful, and distracting. They harm the nighttime environment and
neighbors property values.
Glare
Basic rule of thumb: If you can see the bright bulb from a distance, it's a bad
light. With a good light, you see lit ground instead of the dazzling bulb.
Glare is light that beams directly from a bulb into your eye. It hampers the
vision of pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers.
Light Trespass
Poor outdoor lighting shines onto neighbors properties and into bedroom
windows, reducing privacy, hindering sleep, and giving the area an
unattractive, trashy look.
Energy Waste
Many outdoor lights waste energy by spilling much of their light where it is
not needed, such as up into the sky. This waste results in high operating
costs. We waste over a billion dollars a year in the United States needlessly
lighting the night sky.
Sky Glow
Rays that beam uselessly above the horizon create murky sky glow - the "light
pollution" that washes out our view of the stars.
How do I switch to good lighting?
(1)   Provide only enough light for the task at hand; don't over-light, and
don't spill light off your property. Specifying enough light for a job is
sometimes hard to do on paper. Remember that a full moon can make an area quite
bright. Some lighting systems illuminate areas 100 times more brightly than the
full moon! More importantly, by choosing properly shielded lights, you can meet
your needs without bothering neighbors or polluting the sky.
(2)   Aim lights down. Choose "full-cutoff shielded" fixtures that keep light
from going uselessly up or sideways. Such fixtures produce minimum glare. They
create a pleasant-looking environment. They increase safety because you see
illuminated people, cars, and terrain, instead of being distracted by the
glaring bulb.
(3)   Install fixtures carefully to maximize their effectiveness on the
targeted area and minimize their impact elsewhere. Proper aiming of fixtures is
crucial. Most are aimed too high. Try to install them at night, when you can
see where all the rays actually go. Properly aimed and shielded lights may cost
more initially, but they save you far more in the long-run. They can illuminate
your target with a low-wattage bulb just as brightly as a wasteful light does
with a high-wattage bulb.
(4)   Choose energy-efficient low-pressure sodium (LPS) or high-pressure sodium
(HPS) lamps wherever yellowish light will do the job. Use less efficient white
lights only where ideal color rendition is important.
(5)   Where feasible, put lights on timers to turn them off each night after
they are no longer needed. Put home security lights on a motion-detector
switch, which turns them on only when someone enters the area; this provides a
great deterrent!

Recommended Lighting Levels/Photometrics
Lighting vendors will typically include photometric diagrams similar to those
shown below for each fixture that they offer. The diagrams will help you
determine appropriate lighting for specific applications.

The table below lists recommended lighting levels in units of measurement
called foot-candles. The photometric diagrams specific to the fixtures that you
choose, along with the recommended lighting levels, will help you and/or a
lighting designer determine the most efficient spacing and positioning of
fixtures.

Select a fitting pole for the fixture
The styles of light poles shown below are appropriate for pedestrian and/or
street lighting. Selection of poles should take into consideration the style of
nearby poles so as to maintain a consistent appearance. See the lighting
standards portion of this document for height, spacing, and intensity
requirements.

I. INTRODUCTION
Thank you for your interest in developing on Highway 20 in Galena! While our
history is our key asset, additional growth and economic development in our
community are essential to maintaining our vitality into the future.
Accordingly, we welcome your consideration of Highway 20 and Galena for new or
expanded business and housing opportunities.
However, we all agreed that Galena is unique with an exceptional community
image. That image is what drew most of here, and what will continue to draw new
visitors, businesses and residents in the future. As a result, there is a
strong community consensus that we take proactive steps to define and
articulate that image as we work to attract needed, additional development.
No doubt, your interest in locating in Galena results from our renowned
historic district and exceptional quality of life. Businesses and residents
feel very fortunate to be a part of this outstanding community, and we welcome
the opportunity to share what we have with others. We have a long-established
reputation of providing outstanding hospitality to visitors and are working
hard every day to extend that hospitality to new businesses and residents as
well. We believe that this Design Manual and the corresponding revisions to
other provisions of our Zoning Ordinance are a big step forward in achieving
that goal.
Through this Design Manual we hope to clearly communicate our expectations for
new development and redevelopment, while at the same time simplify the
development review process. Reasonable minds can and will disagree about what
constitutes"good design". As a community, we had many spirited debates about
the qualities that defined our community and those we wished to enhance and add
in the future.
While not everyone will agree with every aspect of the design concepts and
standards contained in this Manual, please be assured that each was carefully
considered and debated by a diverse group of citizens and reviewed by the
community at large. When considered together, we truly believe the concepts and
standards put forth in this Manual will result in development that adds to
Galena's unique image. Further, it also should result in development that
strikes a fair balance between our community goals and objectives and those of
individual property owners.
Again, we appreciate your interest in our community. The information in this
Manual is intended to be an invaluable resource to you as you design your
project that when followed, should result in a predictable, fair and timely
review and approval. As you work your way through the contents, please do not
hesitate to contact the city zoning staff with questions or to discuss your
specific development concepts and designs.
II. HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL
This Manual has been designed to meet the needs of a variety of users,
including; property owners, business owners, architects and other design
professionals, and building and landscape contractors, as well as members of
the Zoning Board of Appeals,City Council, city staff and the general public It
is intended to serve as a guide for preserving and perpetuating an authentic
character of development along the Highway 20 Corridor throughout the City of
Galena. Accordingly, it summarizes the conditions and themes of existing
development, describes the desired character of future development, and
provides general and detailed standards for the pattern, form and quality of
future development. In addition, provides guidance on how to apply this
information to a particular development project, and outlines the design and
development review and approval process.
This Manual is part of the City of Galena Zoning Ordinance (see §
154.303 ) and provides standards for development within the Highway 20 Corridor
Overlay District. As such, it contains only some of the standards applicable to
development in the Corridor, with the remainder of the Zoning Ordinance and
other city codes and ordinances providing the rest. In designing a development
project then, it is essential to be highly familiar with both the contents of
this Manual and all other applicable zoning and land development regulations
contained in the City Code. This Manual has been designed to be consistent and
work in concert with all of the other city zoning and land development
provisions. However, where the provisions of this Manual conflict with any
others contained in the Zoning Ordinance or the Subdivision Ordinance (see
Chapter 153 of this code), the provisions contained in this Manual shall
prevail.
The contents of this Manual provide the following four key concepts to guide
the layout and design of new development within the Highway 20 Corridor Overlay
District:
Chapters III, IV and V describe the pattern and condition of existing
development along the Highway 20 Corridor and the desired character of future
development. Understanding these baseline conditions and desired themes is an
important first step in crafting a development plan that is sensitive to its
context.
Chapters VI and VII provide design standards for subdivisions and Individual
lots respectively. Regardless of which level of development you are
considering, both chapters should be reviewed together, as they provide
detailed direction on the form, style, orientation, scale, and materials
desired for development within the Corridor. Each of the design standards was
established based on the defining characteristics of the Corridor as described
in the previous chapters. As a result, the standards are reflective of Galena's
unique image and are intended to result in development that contributes further
this to authentic character.
Chapter VIII recommends that the city, state and new development projects
incorporate site features that "tell the story" of Galena's history and natural
setting This can be accomplished through a variety of means including
everything from markers and signage, to sculpture and other works of art
Chapter IX is a "cookbook" explaining how to fully incorporate all of the
information in this Manual in your development project, while Chapter X
describes the design and development review and approval process. The process
is intended to provide predictable, swift and positive outcomes for development
proposals that meet the spirit and letter of the design standards.
As a design manual, the information, photographs and illustrations contained in
the following pages address and respond to the opportunities for enhancing and
preserving the visual environment of the Highway 20 Corridor and the entire
City of Galena. The design standards in this Manual are, by specific intent,
illustrative rather than prescriptive. They do not dissect every architectural
or site design influence, nor do they attempt to prescribe specific, detailed
ways to handle every type of project or site. They do, however, provide the
City of Galena with an objective methodology and common framework for reviewing
proposals and attaching conditions, if any, to project approvals.
One final important note to keep in mind as you begin using the information in
this Manual and designing your project; most of the area within the Highway 20
Overlay District is outside of the Historic District, As a result, the current
and future character of development along the corridor is separate and distinct
from that within the Historic District. While there are common elements between
the two, this Design Manual does not encourage nor permit development that
attempts to mimic development within the Historic District. Instead, it seeks
to encourage development that is responsive to its unique setting on the
prairie above the downtown and that contributes to an authentic, high quality
sense of place that is complementary to, but not a duplication of, the Historic
District. Having a good understanding and appreciation of the unique aspects of
the architecture and form of development within the Historic District is
important to establishing the overall context for future development. However,
it does not drive the design standards contained in this Manual, nor should it
drive the design of specific development projects.
   Terms

providing access to the rear of development.
   CROSS STREET. Public street that intersects with Highway 20 providing access
to and from development parcels and establishing a development node.
   INTERNODAL AREA. Area between nodes characterized by setback development and
open space along Highway 20 frontage.
   NODAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERN. Pattern of development which creates concentrated
Highway 20 frontage development at limited access points (cross streets). This
pattern is market driven and reinforces the preservation of viewsheds.
   NODE. Area characterized by concentrated development and smaller setbacks,
located primarily at cross street intersections with Highway 20.
   OPEN SPACE SEPARATOR.  The portion of an internodal area located adjacent to
Highway 20 which separates development from Highway 20. This separator helps to
creates nodes and maintains veiwsheds.
   SIGNIFICANT VISTA CORRIDOR.  Location of significant unobstructed views to
distant features (e.g. bluffs) and pastoral landscapes often located at ravines
and framed by ridges.
   VIEWSHED. Unobstructed view to distant landscape features, horizon, etc.
   VISTA CORRIDOR. Contiguous open space created by separation of buildings
that allow for unobstructed views to distant landscapes from Highway 20.
   Design Standard Terms
The design standards contained herein are either mandatory or discretionary.
The terms REQUIRED and PROHIBITED are mandatory. The terms PREFERRED and
DISCOURAGED are discretionary. These terms are defined as follows:
   DISCOURAGED.  Discouraged items are design elements that should not be used
in order to maintain the desired character and quality of the Overlay District.
These items are not typically found along the Corridor, and detract from the
existing and desired character of the Overlay Districts. Discouraged items are
thought to not comply with the following goals with respect to desired Corridor
character and quality:
Consistency of the context and goals for development.
Consistency of the corridor development concepts.
Consistency of the design district's character.
Consistency of the pattern of development.
Consistency of building orientation, design and materials.
Consistency of site features and elements.
   PREFERRED. Preferred items are design elements that, whenever possible,
should be used in order to maintain the desired character of the Overlay
District. Such items are those typically found along the Corridor and which, in
combination with other preferred items, define the existing and desired
character of the Overlay District. Preferred items are thought to comply with
the following goals with respect to desired Corridor character and quality:
Consistency of the context and goals for development.
Consistency of the corridor development concepts.
Consistency of the design district's character.
Consistency of the pattern of development.
Consistency of building orientation, design and materials.
Consistency of site features and elements.
Incorporating preferred items into a design increases the probability of, but
does not assure, project approval.
   PROHIBITED. Prohibited items are design elements that do not maintain the
desired character or quality of the Overlay District, and are not permitted
under current codes or regulations. Use of prohibited elements mandates project
denial.
   REQUIRED. Required items are design elements that are necessary in order to
maintain the desired character and quality of the Highway 20 Corridor Overlay
District. Compliance is mandatory for project approval.
III. EXISTING CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF THE HIGHWAY 20 CORRIDOR
The existing Galena Highway 20 Corridor varies in character from well-preserved
historic settings, to typical highway-oriented development, to pristine rural
countryside.
The downtown and hillside segments of Highway 20 fall within the Galena
National Register Historic District where changes to sites and buildings are
controlled by rehabilitation design standards. Here you will find preserved
nineteenth-century stone and frame buildings with historic site amenities and
signage along with small scale and/or integrated parking facilities.
Within Galena corporate limits and outside of the Historic District, the
Highway 20 character takes on a much more varied, contemporary, and highway-
oriented character. The road itself widens and traffic speeds are higher. A mix
of more contemporary and automobile-oriented commercial uses have located here
on individual parcels, grouped in strips, or located within the industrial
park. Buildings are set back from the highway, and larger parking lots dominate
some sites. Some older highway-oriented uses now stand empty. Building
character includes new franchise-designed facilities, metal industrial
buildings, and typical gas station facilities, along with aging highway-
oriented commercial uses. Some outdoor storage, waste handling, and loading
facilities are visible from Highway 20. Very few historic structures remain in
this segment. Some views of the surrounding landscape remain while others are
now blocked by structures.
The segment of Highway 20 outside of the corporate limits is currently
"countryside." Primarily rural in character, the surroundings are dominated by
rolling agricultural fields, fence rows, and farmsteads. Some new residential
and golf course development can be seen from one portion of the highway.
This diverse character has influenced the development of the corridor and
district development concepts outlined in the next chapter. These diverse
segments each have issues and important influences on future site development
and building design.
   Development Goals
Based on some of the existing prominent characteristics of the corridor and the
character of future development desired by the city, the standards and guidance
contained in this Manual are intended to further the following development
goals within the Highway 20 Corridor.
Preserve desirable views to farmland, bluffs, and hillsides.
Maintain large open spaces and rural qualities.
Respect, preserve, enhance, and leverage natural features of development sites.
Create a unique and authentic sense of place.
Promote residential and business diversity and vitality.
Create a quality image of development.
Enhance the onsite experience of occupants and visitors of development.
(8)   Coordinate access and traffic between properties.
(9)   Preserve and restore historic structures.
IV. CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS
Successful and attractive development corridors have consistent design themes
and character and coordinate individual development sites into a coherent
development pattern. The following corridor development concepts provide
guidance to community leaders and developers on how to establish positive
development patterns and overriding principles for planning the Highway 20
Corridor outside of the Historic District.
   Nodal Development Pattern
Encourage denser and more highway-oriented development adjacent to limited
highway access points and less dense and setback development at locations
between access points. This development pattern takes advantage of the exposure
and immediate access for businesses, allows for the appropriate location of a
variety of uses, and reduces the negative impact on desired views from the
highway to surrounding landscapes.
   Viewshed Protection
Identify valuable viewsheds and protect them from unnecessary obstruction by
new development. Concentrate development at access nodes and reduce development
density in areas between, especially in areas of valuable viewsheds. Discourage
development in areas of steep topography and drainage ways that afford valuable
views.
   Galena "Edge Corridor" Design Character
The design character of the Highway 20 Corridor outside of the Historic
District should be unique, unified, high-quality, and create the image of a
stable edge corridor for the historic community of Galena.
Encourage design character that respects the historic character of Galena yet
does not confuse or detract from the authentic qualities of the original
structures and urban fabric of the Galena National Register Historic District.
Encourage a use of "traditional" design elements such as articulated facades,
sloped roofs, multiple small windows, etc.
Also encourage design character that is consistent and unifying. Utilize a
consistent use of brick in a limited palette of colors and design elements that
make reference to the "rural" context such as white fences, field stone, fence
and tree rows, etc.
   Galena History
Integrate references to Galena's history into existing and future development.
Appropriate topics would include Galena's "bigger picture" stories such as
connections to the Mississippi River, mining, and the city's connections to the
surrounding agricultural landscape. Galena's northwest Highway 20 Corridor is
also historically significant as the former location of Galena's key intercity
transportation route from the mid-1800s into the 1900s and the former"country
estates" of prominent Galenians.
V. DESIGN DISTRICTS CHARACTER
As discussed in Chapter II, the existing character and future development
potential varies as you traverse Highway 20 through Galena. Each area has
distinctive qualities including the age and style of development, types of land
uses, access and orientation to the highway, open space, and views to the
distant countryside, mounds and Mississippi bluffs. Some of these traits are
highly desirable and need to be retained to create an overall positive image
for the entire highway corridor while others are at odds with that image and
need to be phased out. Further, the west end of the corridor is comprised of
large areas of open space and agricultural lands, some with historic
structures, that will develop over time. While some aspects of that future
development need to be analogous to existing development along the highway, the
pastoral qualities of this area are an important defining element of the entire
corridor that need to be preserved. In order to properly guide the pattern and
design of future development, it's important to first identify the existing and
desired character of development along the Corridor. While most of the design
standards contained the in Chapter VI apply throughout the entire Corridor, it
is important that their application on a particular site respect the unique
qualities of the particular, setting/neighborhood. The following, then, is a
description of the four sub- areas/neighborhoods that comprise the Highway 20
Corridor through the city (see Figure VI.1 on the following page).
   Figure VI.1 - Design Districts
[Click_here_to_view_a_PDF_of_Figure_VI.1]
   Downtown Transition District
The Downtown Transition District is an existing, mostly developed commercial
and residential corridor on the near northwest side of Galena. It is comprised
of Highway 20 (Spring Street) related development parcels within the Historic
District. The form of development is heavily influenced by the steep terrain
adjacent to this portion of Spring Street. Currently, most parcels not on steep
terrain have been developed with historic structures lining Spring Street.
There is potential, however, for some new hillside residential development and
a few infill parcels.
The appearance of this transition corridor is very important to the current
positive image of Galena. Because any property on the slope of the bluffs and
on lower Spring Street is associated with, and literally within the Historic
District, more care must be given to new development. Future infill projects
and future redevelopment of underutilized properties must respect the sensitive
historic context of this area.
In addition to providing a transition between the Historic District and the
Hilltop District, the area itself is undergoing a transition in the types of
land uses. Most of the structures in the area initially were built for
residential use. As the buildings have aged and the volume of traffic on the
highway has increased, the area has become a less desirable location for
residential use and the cost of rehabilitation and maintenance has made
residential use less economical as well. As a result, future conversions to
non-residential use - like offices, art studios and galleries, and boutique
retail - are expected.
Future development in the Downtown Transition District should include
preservation of existing historic structures, strict adherence to Historic
District guidelines, and high quality building materials and site amenities.
   Existing Character
Developed commercial and residential historic sites.
Steeply sloped terrain.
Framed and restricted views.
Historic District status.
   Proposed Character
Preserved historic structures.
Additional conversions from residential to low- density office and commercial
uses.
Coordinated and shared access and parking.
High quality site design and amenities.
Maintenance of historic scale in new construction.
Only approved, high quality materials.
   Hilltop Commercial/Industrial Districts
(Includes both the northwest and southeast areas)
The Hilltop Commercial/Industrial District is an existing, partially developed
commercial and industrial corridor on the northwest side of Galena. It is
comprised of Highway 20 related development parcels within the corporate
boundary and outside the Historic District. The current appearance of this
district and development status of the parcels along Highway 20 is varied. Most
parcels are developed with some properties vacant and not currently viable.
There are several parcels that have never been developed. Every era of
development is represented, dating from the turn of the century to projects
under construction. Structures vary from an historical residence, to an aging
roadside motel, to new metal-sided shops, to the latest commercial franchise.
This area has the greatest potential for new development and redevelopment in
the short term, and its appearance currently has a mixed impact on the image of
the Corridor and entire city. The preservation of historic structures and high
quality new development have enhanced this portion of the Highway 20 Corridor,
while aging structures, vacant properties, and low quality site design and new
construction have diminished the community's image. Future infill projects and
future redevelopment of underutilized properties must serve to improve the
overall character of the Hilltop Commercial/Industrial District.
Future development of the Hilltop Commercial/ Industrial District should
include coordinated access and circulation, higher density development at
access points, preservation of viewsheds to surrounding and distant landscapes,
a unifying character and/or theme for site and building design, consistent use
of design elements, integration of buildings with the character of the sites,
and high quality building materials and site amenities.
   Existing Character
Partially developed commercial and industrial sites.
Inconsistent architectural themes.
Inconsistent setbacks and parking strategies.
Visible service and storage areas.
Rolling, and sometimes steep, terrain.
   Proposed Character
Visually unified through consistent use of brick as a design element.
Coordinated and shared access and parking.
Higher density development at controlled access points.
Preserve views to distant bluffs, mounds and countryside.
High quality site design and amenities.
High quality materials.
Preservation of historic structures.
   Rural Mixed-Use District
The Rural Mixed-Use District is currently "countryside" and outside the core
and edge development of Galena. Views from Highways 20 and 84 are dominated by
rolling agricultural fields framed by fence rows and farmsteads. Panoramic
views to the horizon include wooded hillsides, distinct mound features, and the
bluffs of the Mississippi River valley.
This area has the greatest potential for new development and redevelopment in
the long term. Its current appearance contributes greatly to a positive image
of Galena as an historic city in a beautiful and historic rural and river-
influenced landscape. Future development must enhance, not detract from, this
image. Opportunities also exist to preserve and utilize elements of Galena's
historic "country estates" and to interpret Highway 20 and Galena's history.
Unlike the already developed portions of the Highway 20 Corridor closer to
downtown Galena, the Rural Mixed-Use District can be planned and designed
according to these goals ahead of future development.
Future development of the Rural Mixed-Use District should include coordinated
access and circulation, higher density development at access points,
preservation of viewsheds to surrounding and distant landscapes, a unifying
character and/or theme for site and building design, the consistent use of
design elements, integration of buildings with the character of the sites, and
high quality building materials and site amenities.
The Rural Mixed-Use District also may be influenced in the future by the
construction of a Highway 20 bypass and an interchange of Highways 20 and 84 at
the current "T" intersection. These transportation improvements will likely
increase development pressures at the interchange and create access and site
design issues important to the character of the District.
   Existing Character
Agricultural.
Rolling terrain.
Planted fields.
Fence rows.
Small wood lots.
Scattered farmsteads.
   Proposed Character
Rural or agricultural design theme(s).
Visually unified through consistent use of design elements (e.g. brick, white
fencing).
Coordinated and shared access and parking.
Higher density development at controlled access points.
Views to distant bluffs, mounds and countryside.
High quality site design and amenities.
High quality materials.
Preservation of historic structures.
VI. SUBDIVISION/LARGE AREA DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS
   Overview
The Highway 20 Corridor Overlay District covers extensive areas that are not
yet in the city and/or are not yet subdivided. As discussed in Chapter III of
this Manual, some of the primary purposes for the creation of the Overlay
District and the standards in this Manual are to protect views and vistas to
distant landscapes and topography, and to preserve large open spaces and the
rural qualities that define much of the existing and desired future character
of the Corridor. While designs of individual buildings and building sites have
a significant influence on the Corridor's overall visual quality and theme, the
pattern of development (i.e. how the development lots are laid out, and the
locations and sizes of building areas and open spaces) has an equal or greater
influence. Accordingly, this chapter provides standards for subdivisions and
other large area developments within 1,200 feet of the centerline of Highway 20
(see Figures VI.1 and VI.2 on the following pages). For purposes of this
chapter, "development" shall include all proposed subdivisions and all proposed
building projects on parcels of ten acres or larger that were not created as
part of a subdivision approved in accordance with this chapter.

   Figure VI.2 - Significant Vista Corridors
[Click_here_to_view_a_PDF_of_Figure_VI.1]
A.   REQUIRED SITE ANALYSIS
To properly layout development, a comprehensive Site Analysis must be completed
first. A description of the requirements for a site analysis are included in
Chapter IX of this Manual, which also provides guidance on how to apply the
standards contained in this chapter to a particular project. As discussed in
Chapter IX, the application of the standards contained in this chapter are
contingent upon the presence of historic structures, the natural resources and
physical features of a particular site. However, on the whole, when the
standards of this chapter are applied on a consistent basis, an appropriate
pattern of development will emerge that meets the purposes and goals of the
Overlay District.
B.   REQUIRED TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
A significant component of subdivision design is the location of streets and
access points. This chapter provides standards for creating a continuous public
street network and functional access to development sites. However, these
standards are fairly general and primarily deal with general street layouts and
distances between intersections. What is not covered are detailed street and
intersection designs, such as the number of lanes. These parameters are
dependent upon projected traffic volumes, which can vary widely between
different types of the development. Accordingly, all development shall perform
a traffic analysis as described in Chapter IX.
C.   NODAL DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT
Unlike the highway itself, development within the Overlay District should not
be linear. Instead, development should be concentrated at various nodes
centered on key intersections (see Figures VI.1 and VI.2). The Illinois
Department of Transportation has restricted direct access to Highway 20
throughout most of the Corridor. Therefore, nearly all new development will
take vehicular access from existing streets or those to be dedicated as part of
the development.
The limited access will naturally tend to concentrate development at the
intersections, based on visibility and accessibility. Sites on the corners will
be highly desirable and valuable, while sites further away will be less so.
This market-driven response to development concentration reinforces the goal of
the Overlay District to maintain views by separating areas of intense
development. Accordingly, development generally should be concentrated on
corners with smaller lots, less open space, and buildings pulled close to the
highway and secondary streets. Between nodes, development should be pulled back
from the highway and separated with large expanses of open space to create
views and vistas between buildings to the horizon.
D.   SIGNIFICANT VISTA CORRIDORS
Significant vista corridors have been identified and are shown on Figures VI.1
and VI.2. The significant vista corridor symbols indicate the portions of
Highway 20 from which views are seen, the direction of the views, and the
breath of the views. These delineations are approximate and should be field
verified and more precisely located before parameters are established for new
development design; however, the width of a significant view corridor along the
Highway 20 Corridor shall be at least 100 feet.
E.   APPLICABILITY WITHIN DESIGN DISTRICTS
The subdivision/large area development design standards are applicable to all
project proposals that affect the pattern of development in the Highway 20
Corridor and views to distant landscapes and topography (see Figures VI.1 and
VI.2). Projects in the undeveloped Rural Mixed Use District are especially
influential and must adhere to the following standards.
New projects proposed for the Hilltop Commercial/ Industrial District must
consider nodal design concepts and adhere to the vista corridor standards of
this section. These infill projects are also subject to the requirements of
Building Site/Small Area Development Design Standards of this Manual. The
patterns of development in this District are essentially established, however,
it is acknowledged that access points, street hierarchy, and adjacent
development are beyond the control of proposed infill projects.
New projects proposed for the Southeast Hilltop District must also consider
nodal design concepts and adhere to the vista corridor standards of this
section. These infill projects are also subject to the requirements of Building
Site/Small Area Development Design Standards of this Manual. Development in
this District is essentially built out, however, it is acknowledged that access
points, street hierarchy, and adjacent development are beyond the control of
proposed infill projects.
New projects proposed for the Downtown Transition District should protect the
character of the steep topography and vegetation of this District and strictly
follow the existing pattern of development of the National Register Historic
District. Because of the limited land areas and the historical sensitivity of
this area, no large area developments and the associated patterns of
development are possible in this District.
F.   NODAL DESIGN
Depending on their location, individual developments may comprise as much as an
entire node (all four corners) or as little as one corner. Still others may not
include any nodes, but their design and access will be controlled by an
existing or future node. The following provisions will be applied based on the
specific location of the development. Some developments may need to include all
of the design elements identified below, while others may need to address only
some. However, the development must be designed based on the design of
adjoining development and/or the potential for development on adjoining
properties so that, together, adjoining developments create the desired pattern
of development described in this chapter.
Please note that unless specified otherwise, for all design standards in this
chapter that use Highway 20 as a reference point (such as a minimum distance
from Highway 20), the point on Highway 20 so referenced shall be the closest
point of the Highway 20 right-of-way.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7283.jpg]
 
1.   Nodal Locations
The Highway 20 Corridor already has an established pattern of nodes spaced
about 900 to 1,200 feet apart. Based on this pattern and IDOT access
requirements, new node locations are shown on Figures VI.1 and VI.2. As noted,
many properties in the Downtown Transition District and Hilltop Commercial/
Industrial District currently have direct access to Highway 20. Where possible,
these should be removed as development occurs and replaced with access off of
existing or new public streets. Where such alternative public streets are not
available or possible, the direct private access points should be minimized by
consolidating existing points and through shared access agreements and
easements between adjacent property owners (see Figure VI.3 above).
   Required
Nodes located as shown on Figures VI.1 and VI.2.
Remove existing private direct access points to Highway 20 where possible.
Where access to another street is not possible, consolidate existing private
direct access points to Highway 20.
   Preferred
Where access to another street is not possible, provide access points to
Highway 20 for adjoining properties and provide cross-access easements for on-
site circulation and parking.
   Discouraged
Where access to another street is not possible, more than one access point to
Highway 20 per property.
   Prohibited
Where access to another street is not possible, more than two access points to
Highway 20 per property.
2.   Street Hierarchy
Figure VI.4 provides a schematic layout of streets and access points to nodal
and internodal areas. For purposes of this chapter, CROSS STREETS are public
streets that intersect with Highway 20 to establish the nodes. The ACCESS ROADS
are public streets that generally parallel Highway 20 and function somewhat
akin to frontage roads, except that they are located behind the development.
The street network is a major foundation block of the development pattern and,
as such, has a significant impact on the layout of all subsequent development,
both that within the Overlay District as well that located some distance
beyond. In addition, the street network greatly affects the access to
individual developments as described in the next section. Accordingly, it is
critical that street locations and designs be carefully considered and closely
coordinated with adjoining development and properties.

and Internodal Areas

IMAGES/0-0-0-7286.jpg]
 
   Required
Cross streets and access roads dedicated as public streets that meet all design
requirements of the Galena Subdivision Ordinance.
Cross street intersections with Highway 20 that meet all IDOT design and
permitting requirements.
Access roads that cross the entire width of the development unless they would
adversely impact a significant vista corridor or other significant natural
feature
Cross roads and access roads that follow the natural topography and minimize
the destruction of the natural features and resources covered in §§ 154.501
through
154.510.
Continuation of existing cross streets and access roads through the
development.
   Preferred
Cross street/access road intersections a minimum of 350 feet from Highway 20
intersections, but no greater than 500 feet.
   Discouraged
Signalized cross street/access road intersections.
Cross street/access road intersections less than 350 feet from the Highway 20
intersection, but at least 250 feet.
Cross street/access road intersections greater than 500 feet from the Highway
20 intersection, but less than 650 feet.
   Prohibited
Cross street/access road intersections less than 250 feet from the Highway 20
intersections.
Cross street/access road intersections greater than 650 feet from the Highway
20 intersection.
Street networks that terminate on the site and do not connect to adjacent
properties, except in those instances where the street extension would
adversely impact a significant vista corridor or other significant natural
feature.
3.   Public Street Access and Internal Circulation.
Consistent with IDOT regulations, direct access to Highway 20 is prohibited,
with all access provided from a cross street or access road (see Figure VI.5).
The location and design of access points must be carefully considered to ensure
that the operations of the cross street/Highway 20 and cross street/access road
intersections are not adversely affected. This will result in a limited number
of access points, and therefore requires that individual developments include
internal circulation systems that can be shared by several lots and buildings
within the development, as well as existing or future lots and buildings on
adjoining properties.
   Figure VI.5    Access Roads
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ea11130414a5766f7589ffc547d4d5bc7c948ae0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-7289.jpg]
 
   Required
Shared access and internal circulation easements shall be recorded for lots
and/or building sites within a development and for existing or future lots and
buildings on adjoining property that would require shared access in order to
meet the access standards of this chapter.
   Preferred
Nodal and intemodal access from access roads only.
Driveways on cross streets, where necessary at all, at least 250 feet from the
Highway 20 intersection.
Driveways on cross streets, where necessary at all, at least 100 feet from the
access road intersection.
   Discouraged
Driveways on cross streets, where necessary at all, less than 250 feet from the
Highway 20 intersection, but at least 150 feet.
Driveways on cross streets, where necessary at all, less than 100 feet from the
access road intersection, but at least 50 feet.
   Prohibited
Direct access to Highway 20 (unless required by IDOT).
Driveways on cross streets less than 150 feet from the Highway 20 intersection.
Driveways on cross streets less than 50 feet from the access road intersection.
4.   Nodal Dimensions.
Each corner of a node should be limited to a maximum of three to four acres of
intensive development that is pulled up close to the Highway 20 right-of-way
and the cross street. Between nodes, development should be separated with
extensive areas of open space (open space separators) along Highway 20, with
development behind set back a considerable distance. Figure VI. 6 provides a
schematic layout of nodal, internodal and open space separator areas.
   Required
Development concentrated at nodal corners, except where corners are left open
for vista corridors.
Open space separators to be permanently restricted through protective
covenants, to which the city is a party, or dedication to the city.
   Preferred
Nodal area frontage on Highway 20 of up to 350 feet.
Size of nodal area of two to three acres.
Open space separators with frontage on Highway 20 of at least 50% of the
distance between nodal intersections.
Open space separators with a depth of 75 feet or greater.
   Discouraged
Nodal area frontage on Highway 20 of greater than 350 feet, but less than 500
feet.
Size of nodal area more than three acres, but less than four acres.
Open space separators with frontage on Highway 20 frontage of less than 50%,
but more than 40% of the distance between nodal intersections.
Open space separators with a minimum depth of 50 feet at any one point, but
with an average depth of 75 feet or greater.
   Prohibited
Nodal area frontage on Highway 20 of greater than 500 feet.
Size of nodal area of four acres or greater.
Open space separators with Highway 20 frontage of 40% or less of the distance
between nodal intersections.
Open space separators with a minimum depth of less than 50 feet at any one
point, and/or an average depth of less than 75 feet.

5.   Vista Corridors.
As discussed earlier in this Manual, vistas and views to distance hillsides and
pastoral landscapes are one of the primary character defining elements of the
entire Highway 20 Corridor. The landscape also is punctuated by ravines and
other natural features that are striking in their own right, as well as
providing wide, unobstructed views to the distance. Figure VI.7 indicates the
location of these significant vista corridors. In addition to preserving these,
it is important that development between nodes provide additional vista
corridors to preserve views and maintain an appropriate amount of open space
and separation of buildings along the Corridor. Figure VI.7 is a sketch of a
vista corridor that complies with the standards provided in this section.
   Figure VI.7    Vista Corridor
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ea11130414a5766f7589ffc547d4d5bc7c948ae0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-7295.jpg]
 
   Required
Preservation of the significant vista corridors as shown on Figures VI.1 and
V1.2 in accordance with the provisions of this section.
A minimum of two viewsheds between each nodal intersection.
The apex of a viewshed shall be located five feet above the Highway 20
centerline and the viewshed shall have a 14º angle; however, no area of the
viewshed shall be less than 50 feet wide.
The apex of a viewshed shall be located in front of, and the entire width of
the viewshed shall cross, an open space separator located adjacent to Highway
20.
The viewshed across the open space separator shall be free of paving and all

VII. BUILDING SITE/SMALL AREA DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS
A.   SITE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The combined appearance and character of contiguous building site developments
will have a major impact on the character of Galena's Highway 20 corridor. Site
designs set the tone for the development cluster and individual buildings, as
well as the direct experience of the user. Site development also affects
neighboring properties and the area's environment.
The Building Site/Small Area Development Design Standards are applicable to all
project proposals that affect the appearance of the Highway 20. Projects
proposed in the Rural Mixed-Use District, Hilltop Commercial/Industrial
District, and the Southeast Hilltop District within 1,200 feet, unless
otherwise specified, of the centerline of Highway 20 must adhere to the
following standards.
Projects proposed for the Downtown Transition District must meet the
requirements of the following design standards as well as the standards of the
National Register Historic District.
   Site Development Standards
      1.   Siting of Buildings.
      2.   Driveways and Parking.
      3.   Site Signage and Lighting.
      4.   Landscaping.
      5.   Site Features.
      6.   Storm Water Management Features.
1.   Siting of Buildings
The siting of buildings will have a major impact on the character of Highway 20
and adjacent cross streets. Siting affects the functionality of the site, the
impact of parking areas, as well as the visibility of a building's activity
areas, building entries and service areas. A well-sited building will have a
presence on the street, help to define edges of sites, create a desirable site
composition, and allow access for maintenance.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7298.jpg]
 
   Required
Nodal area building setbacks from Highway 20 right-of-way: 10 to 20 feet.
Nodal area building setbacks from cross street right-of-way: 10 feet (without
parking) to 80 feet (with parking).
Internodal area building setbacks from Highway 20 right-of-way: 150 to 175
feet.
Internodal area building setbacks from cross street right-of-way: 10 to 80
feet.
   Preferred
Grouped buildings (in a multiple building development) that create internal
spaces, break up parking areas, and are connected by a walkway system.
Corner buildings that frame streets and intersections.
   Discouraged
Linear "strip commercial" development pattern.
2.   Driveways and Parking
Driveways and parking areas are a necessary functional component of a new
development site and can also adversely affect a site's visual character and
experience of a site's users. Well-located drives and parking areas do not
detract from the landscape character neither do they detract from the intended
focus of a development site the buildings and site amenities.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ea11130414a5766f7589ffc547d4d5bc7c948ae0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-7301.jpg]
 
   Required

Parking area frontage on Highway 20 or cross street: More than 180 feet.
3.   Site Signage and Lighting
Signage and lighting have a major impact on site character. Signage sets the
tone of a commercial area and is often the first impression a visitor has of a
highway corridor. The appearance of lighting structures and fixtures, as well
as the lighting quality itself can add or detract from a site's character.
Lighting can "pollute" the night sky and overwhelm neighboring properties if
not well designed. The following standards are concerned with signage location
and design style as well as lighting scale and appearance. Consult §§ 154.801
through 154.815 regarding size and additional design requirements for signage
as well as §§ 154.601 through
154.605 concerning lighting glare and trespass.
   Required
Monument style signage (See §§
154.801 through 154.815 for size requirements) consistent with architecture of
building.
Signage material and design to be compatible with architectural design
character.
   Preferred

   Discouraged
High mast lighting (over 30 feet in height).
Brightly colored light structures and fixtures.
   Prohibited
Pole-mounted signage.
4.   Landscaping
Landscaping affects the visibility of site features and parking areas and the
setting for the building. It also affects the relationship to adjacent sites,
vistas to the surrounding landscape, the climactic comfort, and the overall
attractiveness, character and identity of a site.
   Preferred
Retained mature landscaping where possible.
Limited and consistent palette of plantings.
Plant material form and texture compliments site design.
Low growing shrub plantings (evergreen species - only as high as necessary to
screen parking areas, utilities, waste storage, etc.).

Trees that enhance and frame views, yet, do not block vistas.
Shade trees in parking areas (where they do not block vistas).
   Discouraged
Trees that block business signage or views.
Invasive or exotic species.
Synthetic or artificial plant materials.
5.   Site Features
Site features include site furniture, special design elements, and features
that are not considered accessory structures (see Architectural Building
Standards: Accessory Structures) or a part of the building architecture.
   Preferred
Patios and other activity areas.
Walkways with high-quality materials at building entry and approaches.

detention, can add or detract from the appearance and character of a site.
Careful site planning and design can locate and configure these features to
benefit the project.
   Required
On-site infiltration and detention as required by code.
   Preferred
Stormwater facility integrated with other site design elements.
Stormwater and detention structure utilized as a site amenity.
   Discouraged
Large banks of hard surface or rip-rap materials.
Visible engineered structures.
B.   ARCHITECTURAL BUILDING STANDARDS
The combined appearance and architectural character of new buildings has a
major impact on the character of Galena's Highway 20 Corridor. Overall building
form, roof character, facade design, use of materials and colors, location and
configuration of windows, building detailing, and the handling of equipment and
accessory needs on-site are all factors. All combined, they can add or detract
from the quality of the corridor, the success of businesses, and the user's
experience.
Projects proposed in the Rural Mixed-Use District, Hilltop Commercial/
Industrial District, and the Southeast Hilltop District within 1,200 feet,
unless otherwise specified, of the centerline of Highway 20, must adhere to the
following standards. Projects in above said Districts located between 1,200 and
2,400 feet of the centerline of Highway 20 shall be exempt from the

7.   Service Areas, Utility Equipment
Every building is served by deliveries, waste pick-up, utilities, and
mechanical equipment. These service areas and pieces of equipment can detract
from the primary uses and desired appearance of a building without proper
placement and screening.
   Preferred
Service and delivery areas located away from highway and building entry areas.
Screened mechanical and utility equipment.
Alternative energy equipment that is integrated with building design.

VIII. GALENA ROADSIDE INTERPRETATION
The importance, image, and history of Galena extend beyond the National
Register Historic District and into the nearby countryside. Visitors to Galena
begin their experience of Galena as they approach the community on Highway 20.
Steeples located in the core of Galena peek above the ridge tops. The Galena
and Mississippi River valleys, so important to the history of Galena, are
apparent. The countryside, where farm products for Galena have been raised for
a century and a half fill the immediate roadside view. Galena's northwest
Highway 20 Corridor is also historically significant as the former location of
Galena's key intercity transportation route from the mid-1800s into the 1900s
and the former "country estates" of prominent Galenians. An existing roadside
at the interchange of Highways 20 and 84 already recognizes the importance of
this vantage point for roadside interpretation.
The State of Illinois, City of Galena and private development along the highway
should take advantage of these historic references and panoramic views to
interpret this history and communicate a positive image of the community.
Public entities could identify potential funding sources, identify prototypes
in the state highway system, select appropriate themes, identify appropriate
locations for these interpretive roadsides, and acquire the necessary right-of-
ways and/or easements for implementation. In addition to reflecting the
community character through the design of sites and buildings, private
development also can incorporate interpretative elements on their sites in the
form of markers and signs, sculpture and other works of art, landscaping, and
exhibits.
Potential themes for interpretation include: (1) Galena Toll Road and early
links to Dubuque and Mineral Point, (2) "country estates" of prominent
Galenians, (3) landmarks of Galena, (4) the Mississippi and Galena River
connection, (5) natural landscape history, (6) mining, and (7) farming and
Galena. Facilities could include a small parking area, viewing platform, and/or
interpretive displays. Because of limited highway access requirements,
interpretive information may be integrated into future developments.
IX. HOW TO APPLY ZONING AND DESIGN STANDARDS TO A PROJECT
   Laying Out A Project
As a developer of large areas and individual parcels in the Highway 20
Corridor, you will need to apply the previously described design standards to
your project design process. This process will include site analysis, building
and site design, and a self evaluation of the proposed design.
A.   Large Area Site Analysis
Analysis of the area's natural characteristics and existing neighboring
patterns of development will help identify its design constraints and
opportunities, create a site and building design that is integrated with the
setting, and assist the designer in meeting development standards. The
following is a checklist of site characteristics to be analyzed.
   1.   Topography.
   2.   Vegetation.
   3.   Soils.
   4.   Groundwater and surface runoff.
   5.   Solar orientation.
   6.   Vistas from and through site.
   7.   Views to site.
   8.   Site access.
   9.   Existing traffic patterns.
   10.    Adjacent site and building designs.
   11.    Presence of historic structures.
B.   Site and Building Design
The design of a site and its building(s) involves determining how the project
fits into the Highway 20 Corridor and the site's design district, the larger
development pattern, the desired site and building character, and the site's
particular characteristics. The Design Manual describes standards at each of
these levels that are applicable to your project. Figure X.1 following this
section provides an example of how a development may be laid out using all of
these standards.
   1.   Review Highway 20 Corridor development concepts. Use these concepts to
begin to shape your understanding of the future character of the corridor.
   2.   Determine the design district in which the project is located and use
the proposed character for that district to being to shape your vision of your
project. (The project proposal will be evaluated on these characteristics).
   3.   Determine Highway 20 access points and access route to site. Access to
your project will be via a limited access point and cross street from Highway
20.
   4.   Determine whether site is in a nodal or internodal location. This
determination will affect standards for setbacks, locations of building and
parking areas, etc.
   5.   Determine setbacks and separation requirements for building and parking
areas.
   6.   Combine results of site analysis and the parameters of the above
constraints to develop site design strategies and concepts. Develop strategy
for building locations to protect vistas, preserve historic structures,
integrate development into site, minimize impervious surfaces, etc. Develop
concept plan including determination of access points, site circulation,
parking areas, building location, building service and customer entry
locations.
   7.   Evaluate concept plan to see if it meets design standards.
   8.   Develop plan with real footprints of building, parking, drives,
walkways, and landscaping. Utilize Site Development Standards to guide site
design.
   9.   Develop building design to meet architectural building standards.
   10.   Evaluate design:
      a.   Disturbance, cut-and-fill, impervious surface.
      b.   Nodal concepts.
      c.   Site access.
      d.   Building and parking locations.
      e.   View corridors.
      f.   Site standards.
      g.   Architectural building standards.
      h.   Traffic analysis including projected trip generation, peak hourly
traffic, parking stacking, sight lines, access relationship to existing
intersections.
      i.   Compatibility with adjacent development.
X. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW APPROVAL PROCESS
The standards and regulations contained in this Design Manual for the Highway
20 Overlay District apply to all development activities (including everything
from grading and filling, to paving, to new construction and additions, to all
new principal and major and minor accessory structures and additions thereto)
within 1,200 feet of the Highway 20 centerline (as it exists at the time
development is proposed). The standards and regulations also apply to all
proposed subdivision plats within 1,200 feet of the centerline of Highway 20.
No development covered by this Design Manual may be undertaken without first
obtaining approval of a Highway 20 Development Permit from the appropriate
review body.
To equate the intensity, length and cost of the development review process with
the potential impacts of a proposed development, the city has established a
three-tiered development review process, each with a different review body.
These bodies include, from lowest to highest, the Zoning Administrator, Zoning
Board of Appeals, and City Council. Depending on the type and size of a
proposed development, a review body may provide either a recommendation to a
higher review body or take final action on an application. Table X.1. indicates
the responsibilities and authority vested with each review body.
Section 154.915 provides an outline of the processes and procedures for
applications for an administrative Highway 20 development permit to be acted
upon by the Zoning Administrator.
Section 154.922 provides an outline of the processes and procedures for
applications for a non- administrative Highway 20 development permit to be
acted upon by the Zoning Administrator and City Council.

market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SFHA. See definition of FLOODPLAIN.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement and means the date
the building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or
other improvement, was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the

improvement of a structure taking place during a ten year period in which the
cumulative percentage of improvements: equals or exceeds 50% of the market
value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started; or
increases the floor area by more than 20%. SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures
which have incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the
actual repair work done. The term does not include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing

necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
      (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the required federal, state, and/or local permits
and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided.

§
155.008;
   (E)   Ensure that water supply and waste disposal systems meet the public
health standards of §
155.009;
   (F)   If a variance is requested, ensure that the requirements of §
155.010 are met and maintain documentation of any variances granted;
   (G)   Inspect all development projects and take any and all penalty actions
outlined in §
155.999 as necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter;
   (H)   Assure that applicants are aware of and obtain any and all other
required local, state, and federal permits;
   (I)   Notify IDNR/OWR and any neighboring communities prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse;
   (J)   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about
permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques;
   (K)   Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to
coordinate base flood data and to improve the administration of this chapter;
   (L)   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps,
copies of state and federal permits, and documentation of compliance for
development activities subject to this chapter;

make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain;
and
   (N)   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six months whenever a modification
of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in a change to
the floodplain map.
(Ord. O-10-24, passed 8-23-10)
§ 155.005 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator
shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet
the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   General development shall not occur in the floodplain where
alternative locations exist. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall
demonstrate that:
      (1)   No reasonable alternative exists outside the floodplain;
      (2)   Encroachment in the floodplain is the minimum necessary;
      (3)   The development will withstand the 100-year flood without
significant damage; and,
      (4)   The development will not increase downstream or upstream flooding
or erosion.
      (5)   In the floodplain no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with the standard engineering practice by a licensed
Illinois State engineer that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in the 100-year flood elevation.
   (B)   Once the applicant has demonstrated the provisions of division (A) of
this section, the application for a development permit shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      (2)   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      (3)   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings;
      (4)   The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of §
155.007; and
      (5)   Cost of project or improvements as estimated by a licensed engineer
or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
   (C)   (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the
Zoning Administrator shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that is shown to be below the
current base flood elevation is subject to the provisions of this chapter. In
addition, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood
elevation and hydraulically connected to a flood source, but not identified as
floodplain on the current flood insurance rate map, is subject to the
provisions of this chapter. Any development located on land that can be shown
by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has
not been filled after the date of the site’s first flood insurance rate map is
not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance
rate map identification.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals
or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity.
The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a permit unless all other federal,
state, and local permits have been obtained.

§ 155.011 VARIANCES.
   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals
for a variance. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Zoning Board
of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to granting
of a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,

      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP.
      (7)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protections standards of §
155.007 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic structures. Variances to the building protection requirements
of §
155.007 which are requested in connection with reconstruction, repair, or
alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in "historic
structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of §§
155.006 and
155.007 subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture.
      (1)   Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided
individually based on a case by case analysis of the building’s unique
circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as
those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and
the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be
included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are
constructed at-grade and wet- proofed:
         (a)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
         (b)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community’s flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
         (c)   For any new of substantially damaged agricultural structures,
the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation,
wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base
flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance
with §
155.007.
         (d)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with §
155.007. All of the building’s structural components must be capable of
resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
         (e)   Any mechanical, electrical or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with §
155.007(B).
         (f)   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to
the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters in accordance with §
155.007(B).
         (g)   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of § 155.006. No variances may be issued for
agricultural structures within any designated floodway.
         (h)   Wet-proofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the Floodplain Administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction.

§ 155.012 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.

§ 155.013 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city to
fulfill therequirements of the National Flood Insurance Program including:
Ordinance O-99-06, passed 5-24-1999; amended by Ordinance O-05-16, passed 5-23-
2005; amended by Ordinance O-10-24, passed 8-23-2010. However, this chapter
does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve
eligibility eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate,
or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this
chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict
or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

§ 155.999 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Zoning Administrator may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
Zoning Administrator shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation:
      (1)   The city shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter.
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than $50 or more than $750 for each offense.
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues.
      (4)   The city shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   (B)   (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in
writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if
necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The
stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (3)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.
      (4)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
