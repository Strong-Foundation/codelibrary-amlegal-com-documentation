§ 30.09 PROCEDURES FOR ELECTRONIC ATTENDANCE.
   (A)   Rules statement. It is the decision of the Village of Maryville
("Village") that any member of the Village Board of Trustees of the Village may
attend any open or closed meeting of the Board via electronic means (such as by
telephone, video or Internet connection) provided that such attendance is in
compliance with these rules and any applicable laws.
   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the Board may attend a meeting
electronically if the member meets the following conditions: A quorum is
physically present throughout the meeting; and, a majority of the members
present vote to approve the electronic attendance at the meeting.
      (1)   The member should notify the Village Clerk at least 48 hours before
the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications equipment can
be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical arrangements will result
in the denial of a request for electronic attendance.
      (2)   The member must assert one of the following four reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
         (a)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability;
         (b)   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the village;
         (c)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency;
or
         (d)   Unexpected childcare obligations.
      (3)   The Village Clerk, after receiving the electronic attendance
request, shall inform the Board of the request for electronic attendance.
   (C)   Voting procedures. After a roll call establishing that a quorum is
physically present, the presiding officer shall call for a motion that a member
may be permitted to attend the meeting electronically after specifying the
reason entitling the absent member to attend electronically. The motion must be
approved by a vote of a majority of the members present.
   (D)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating electronically,
and other members of the Board, must be able to communicate effectively, and
members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the meeting
site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the village shall
provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site.
   (E)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting. The
meeting minutes shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member
is physically present or present by electronic means.
   (F)   Rights of remote members. A member permitted to attend electronically
will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to.
The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as
to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically
shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded
by the Village Clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A
member attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case
of any member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his
or her leaving and returning.

§ 34.08 TRAVEL, MEAL AND LODGING EXPENSES.
   (A)   Definitions. For purposes of this section the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      ENTERTAINMENT. Includes, but is not limited to, shows, amusements,
theaters, circuses, sporting events, or any other place of public or private

      PUBLIC BUSINESS. Expenses incurred in the performance of a public purpose
which is required or useful for the benefit of the village to carry out the

transportation or related services.
   (B)   The village shall only reimburse the following types of travel, meal
and lodging expenses incurred by its employees and officers up to the following

      (3)   Lodging. $200 per night.
      (4)   Meals. $50 per day.

(Ord. 2017-01, passed 2-1-17; Am. Ord. 2023-07, passed 2-1-23)
§ 34.09 PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   Prohibition on sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass a person
because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment
is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment
free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which
affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of
the Village of Maryville to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal
official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on
the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents,
municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from
sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or
lack thereof.
   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment. This policy adopts the definition of
sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently
defines sexual harassment as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
         (b)   Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
         (c)   Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (d)   Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (e)   Textual/electronic. "Sexting" (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and/or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person."
   (C)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his
position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not
necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
      (2)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
         (a)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
            1.   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of
the municipality.
            2.   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
         (c)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is
to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
      (3)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
      (4)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
   (D)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.
      (1)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:
         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
         (b)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein,
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs
in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state
agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or
         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS ch. 740, Act 174, § 15(a)),
an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in
a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or
committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal
law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an
employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency,
where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation. (ILCS Ch.
740, Act 174, § 15(b)).
      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act 5, §
6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people
to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that
which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - either due within 300 days of the alleged
retaliation.
   (E)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, § 5-65, may
be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
   (F)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
State's Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

§ 34.10 PAID LEAVE FOR WORKERS.
   Pursuant to Section 15(p) of the Paid Leave for Workers Act, the village
hereby adopts its current paid leave policy for all village employees as set
forth in this code, employee handbook, annual salary ordinances, any collective
bargaining agreements to which the village is a party and all other binding
legislative actions governing paid leave adopted by the President and Board of
Trustees of the village, as the same may be amended from time to time. However,
in no event shall the village, as an employer, provide less than one day of
paid leave per year to any village employee.
(Ord. 2023-71, passed 12-20-23)
§ 34.11 RULES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
   (A)   It shall be the policy of the Village of Maryville that any person

      (2)   No person shall be permitted to speak until being recognized by the

      (3)   No speaker may give their allotted minutes to another person.
      (4)   Time limits shall not apply to public hearings.
   (D)   Responses. Members of the governing body are not required to answer
questions or to otherwise respond to public comments. Comments may be taken
under advisement and may be referred to the appropriate staff member for
response outside the meeting.
   (E)   Decorum.
      (1)   All speakers, and the audience, shall respect the presiding
officer's directions in furtherance of maintaining proper order, respect and
decorum during the meeting.

order and decorum of the meeting may be removed.

REGULATIONS
§ 50.15 CONTRACT FOR UTILITIES SERVICES.

         (b)   In the event that any check, online payment, automatic
deduction, or other method of payment presented for payment of utility service
is rejected or returned not paid to the village (such as for insufficient
funds, account closed and the like), a charge in the amount of $20 for each
check so delivered or rejected payment shall be assessed to help defray the

shall be mailed to the owner of the premises if his or her address is known to
the Treasurer whenever the bill remains unpaid for a period of 30 days after it
has been rendered.
      (3)   The failure of the Treasurer to record the lien or to mail the
notice or the failure of the owner to receive the notice shall not affect the
right to foreclose the line for unpaid utility bills as mentioned herein.
   (J)   Foreclosure of lien.
      (1)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid utility charges shall be sold
for non-payment of the same and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to

situated within the village to the village sewerage system without first making
application therefor to the village Building and Zoning Department office and
paying the applicable tap-on fees established by ordinance.
      (2)   Premises outside village. No person shall connect any premises
situated outside the village to the village sewerage system without first
making written application therefor to the Village Board and obtaining the
Village Board’s approval. Any such connection shall be subject to such
conditions as the Village Board may impose in its sole discretion.
      (3)   Connections to waterworks system required. No person shall connect
any premises to the sewerage system of the village unless such person also
connects such premises to the waterworks system of the village. However, if
there is no available portion of the waterworks system that can reasonably be
tapped onto by a person seeking such sewer service, then the person may appeal
to the Village Board to be excused from the provisions of this section,
provided that the person agrees at such time to tap on to the waterworks system
as soon as the same is accessible to him or her, as determined in the sole
discretion of the village.
      (4)   Expanded use of existing sewer tap. Additions or renovations of
existing buildings or expanded use of an existing sewer lateral for new
construction that generates an increase in sewer usage of more than 100 gallons
per day (gpd) shall be assessed a connection fee. This connection fee is
calculated using the estimated peak daily flow multiplied by the then current
peak daily flow multiplier. This connection fee does not apply to single-family
residential renovations or additions unless the usage of a single-family
residence changes to duplex, multi-family, industrial or commercial. At the
time a new building permit is issued for remodeling or occupancy is applied
for, an additional permit fee will be charged at the current sewer connection
fee based on the new population equivalent (PE) calculation of the new use if
it is to increase over the previous PE fee paid.
   (B)   Sewer permit connection fees.
      (1)   Residential. A separate sewer permit fee shall be required for each
residential unit, including residential multi-family units such as apartments,
villas, town houses, and town homes. The tap-on fee cost for each residential
unit is $3,000 for in-village and $4,000 for out-of-village. (This permit fee
includes an inspection fee of $150.)
      (2)   Commercial, industrial and multiplex elder care, nursing care or
assisted living buildings and other type facilities. Mutliplex elder care,
nursing care, or assisted living unit residential buildings,
all commercial, industrial, and other type users shall be charged a sewer
permit fee in accordance with the following schedule which includes a charge
for connection of each commercial, industrial or special purpose facility
connected to the sanitary sewer system:
         (a)   Sewer permit fees shall be based on population equivalent,
defined by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, State of Illinois
Rules and Regulations, Title 35, Subchapter C, Chapter 1, Section 301.345, as a
term used to evaluate the impact of industrial or other waste on a treatment
works or stream. One population equivalent is 100 gallons (380 liters) of
sewage per day, containing .17 pounds (77 grams) of BOD5 (5-day biochemical
oxygen demand) and .20 pounds (91 grams) of suspended solids.
         (b)   State of Illinois Rules and Regulations, Title 35, Subtitle C,
Part 370, Design Standards for Sewage Works, Appendices A and B, contain
resident occupancy criteria and commonly used quantities of sewage flows for
various types of facilities. If the type of facility to be connected is not
listed, documentation from similar type facilities will be used to determine
wastewater population equivalent (PE). The sewer permit fees for each sewer
permit for users with greater than 3.5 PE wastewater discharges to the sanitary
sewer system shall be the permit fee for 3.5 PE plus a fee for each additional
PE.
         (c)   Sewer permit fees based on population equivalents (PE) are as
follows:
 
Population Equivalent   Within Village Outside of Village
0 - 3.5 PE              $3,000         $4,000
Greater than 3.5 PE     $250/PE        $300/PE
(additional fee per PE)
Effective May 1, 2024, there shall be an annual increase of $25 to the
single-family fee

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 54.01 PURPOSE; SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,

§ 54.12 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months, unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance at a pre-
construction meeting by the permittee and all major contractors and
subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village, with
such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.

material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village, within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work, for approval of the location deviation.
The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations
of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If
any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this
chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with §
54.38 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit, and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.

be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village, and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives,
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.

§ 54.16 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section, at the permittee’s
sole cost and expense, until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by the permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by the permittee in violation of this chapter, including,
without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the
permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform
itself, or have completed, as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure
to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the
permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division (B) shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Provide a location convenient to the village and within the State
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Building and Zoning Administrator, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Building and
Zoning Administrator may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each
phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for
phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days’ advance, written notice,
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division
(C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for the withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of the revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of the costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to the security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-
of-way to the satisfaction of the village, providing written proof of such
removal to the village within ten days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
      (2)   The village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend
the time periods provided in this division (C).
   (D)   Stop-work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the village may issue a stop-work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of
this section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply.
      (1)   If the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of division
(C) of this section, the village or its designee may, at the option of the
village:
         (a)   Correct the deficiencies;
         (b)   Upon not less than five days’ notice to the permittee, remove
the subject facilities or equipment; or
         (c)   After not less than 15 days’ notice to the permittee of failure

§ 54.32 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division
(A).
      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Building and Zoning Administrator
determines that the proposed location will require the relocation or
displacement of any of the village’s utility facilities or will otherwise
interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the village’s utility
facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin the right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No Limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near as practicable to, and not more than five
feet (1.5 m) from, the right-of-way line, and any aboveground appurtenance
shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of, or as near as practicable to, the
right-of-way line.
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near as practicable to, and not more than five
feet (1.5 m) from, the right-of-way line, and any aboveground appurtenance
shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of, or as near as practicable to, the
right-of-way line.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90-degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC’s
rules entitled, “Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines” (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
         (b)   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way
line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         (b)   Capacity for the utility’s foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 C.F.R. § 192.707
(1989)).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed aboveground. Aboveground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting,
armless, single-pole construction, with vertical configuration of conductors
and cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant or
potential pressure, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure, supporting data demonstrating
the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user, or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.

§ 54.33 CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS.
   (A)   Standards and requirements for particular types of construction
methods.
      (1)   Boring or jacking.
         (a)   Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance, specified by the Building
and Zoning Administrator, from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or
jacking shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of boring or
jacking operations, and backfilled within 48 hours after boring or jacking
operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and
protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced,
and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads
that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
         (b)   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         (c)   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over six
inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and following
pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside diameter of
the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).
         (d)   Borings with diameters six inches or less. Borings of six inches
or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking, guided with an
auger, or the auger-and-following-pipe method.
         (e)   Tree preservation. Any facility located within the drip line of
any tree designated by the village to be preserved or protected shall be bored
under or around the root system.
      (2)   Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair, or
maintenance on rights-of-way shall be done in accord with the applicable
portions of Section 603 of IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction.”
         (a)   Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to the
practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time, unless
special permission is obtained from the Building and Zoning Administrator.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length, using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction.” When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         (b)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Building and Zoning Administrator, the utility, at its expense,
shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed
facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new
pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by
the Building and Zoning Administrator.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division (A)(4)
is permitted under § 54.21, the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Building and Zoning Administrator.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction, or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of a water main or service crossing, encasement
shall be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village-approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell-and-spigot-type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided
and maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for
minimum cover for the type of facility:
 
TYPE OF FACILITY                      MINIMUM COVER
Electric lines                        30 inches (0.8 m)
Communication, cable or video service 18 to 24 inches (0.6 m, as determined by
lines                                 village)

electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation-control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreements
with the village as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities - tree-trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree-trimming permit. Applications for tree-
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers, with supervision, who are experienced in accepted tree-
pruning practices. Tree-trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in
the interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree-trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or the unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side-
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
   (D)   Chemical use.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) below, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the village for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or
disease.
      (2)   Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights-of-way, unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Building and Zoning Administrator that such spraying is the only
practicable method of vegetation control.

utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way, whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon,
the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 60
days. Following receipt of such notice, the village may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the Building and Zoning
Administrator determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not
direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice
of abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to
consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by
another utility or person.

way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by
the utility, all to the satisfaction of the village. This includes restoration
of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made
using materials and methods approved by the Building and Zoning Administrator.
Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading,
reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a
condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the
commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may be
extended by the Building and Zoning Administrator for good cause shown.

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify
noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way,
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Building and Zoning Administrator, or his or her duly authorized agent, of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for the
protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with
the free movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a

Zoning Administrator as a part of the permit application. The request shall
identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested, and
the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Building and Zoning Administrator
shall decide, on an individual basis, whether a variance is authorized for each
provision of this chapter identified in the variance request.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Building and Zoning
Administrator may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the
variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Building and Zoning Administrator may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter, but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Building
and Zoning Administrator under the provisions of this chapter, shall have the
right to appeal to the Village Board, or to such other board or commission as
it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to
the Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement,
decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its consideration
of the appeal at the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at
least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely
decide the appeal.

§ 54.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third-party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village’s costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit-
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

section, the driver of a motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal
which fails to change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not

   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this village at a speed
which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.
Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person
or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and
the duty of all persons to use due care.
   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which is
greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
divisions (C) and (D) below, by §
71.002, or by a regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.

this section is guilty of a petty offense. Violations of this section are
punishable with a minimum fine of $150 for the first violation and a minimum
fine of $300 for the second or subsequent violation.
      (2)   A person committing a violation of this section is guilty of
aggravated special speed limit while passing schools when he or she drives a
motor vehicle at a speed that is:
         (a)   Twenty-six miles per hour or more but less than 35 miles per
hour in excess of the applicable special speed limit established under this
section or a similar provision of a local ordinance and is guilty of a Class B

per hour while passing a school zone, or while traveling on a local, county, or
state roadway on public school property or upon any public thoroughfare where
children pass going to and from school.
   (C)   This section shall not be applicable unless appropriate signs are
posted upon streets wherein the school zone is located. The signs shall give
proper due warning that a school zone is being approached, and shall indicate
the school zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when
school children are present. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of
electronic speed-detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special
school speed zone indicating the zone, as defined in this section, nor shall
evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speed,
provided the use of the device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed
limit in the special school speed zone.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2), a person who violates
this section is guilty of a petty offense. Violations of this section are
punishable with a minimum fine of $150 for the first violation, a minimum fine
of $300 for the second or subsequent violation, and community service in an
amount determined by the court.

EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet
from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall not proceed until the tracks
are clear and he or she can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall
apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagger gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and the train or railroad track equipment, by
reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an immediate hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
         (a)   Whenever any person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as
defined in ILCS Chapter 625, Act 5, § 6-500, approaches a railroad grade
crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet
from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until the tracks
are clear and he or she can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall
apply when:
            1.   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
            2.   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or
continues to give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or
railroad track equipment;
            3.   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a
highway crossing emits a warning signal and such railroad train or railroad
track equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an
immediate hazard;
            4.   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing;
            5.   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
         (b)   Whenever a person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined
in ILCS Chapter 625, Act 5, § 6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where
the driver is not always required to stop but must slow down, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall slow down within 50 feet but not less that 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she checks that the tracks are clear of an approaching train or railroad track
equipment.
   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around, or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (C)   When stop signs are erected at railroad grade crossings, the driver of
any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the
nearest rail of the railroad, and shall proceed only upon exercising due care.
   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs,
without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates, or a
human flagger giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad
track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly
marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not less than 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment
after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference
is prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.
   (E)   No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to
negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient
undercarriage clearance.
   (F)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section.

its owner. The facility owned by the village shall be moved to accommodate the
permittee unless the cost of the work is borne by the permittee. The cost of
moving privately-owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee
unless other arrangements are made with the person owning the facility. The
permittee shall support and protect, by timbers or otherwise, all pipes,
conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by
the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and
protect them under, over, along or across the work. The permittee shall secure
approval of method of support and protection from the owner of the facility.
   (B)   In case any of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should
be damaged, and for this purpose, pipe coating or other encasement or devices
are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly
notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the
agency or person owning them and the expense of the repairs shall be charged to
the permittee. It is the intent of this section that the permittee shall assume
all liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or injury to
anyone because of the facility damage and the assumption of liability is a
contractual obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be instances
where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the owning utility. The

preserve and protect from injury, any adjoining property by providing proper
foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where, in the
protection of the property, it is necessary to enter upon private property for
the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall
obtain consent from the owner of the private property for the purpose and, if
he or she cannot obtain consent, the Street Superintendent may authorize him or
her to enter the private premises solely for the purpose of making the property
safe.
   (B)   (1)   At the permittee’s own expense, all buildings, walls, fences or
other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work
shall be shored up and protected, and the permittee shall be responsible for
all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from failure to
properly protect and carry out the work.
      (2)   Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through
any lawn area, the area shall be re-seeded or the sod shall be carefully cut
and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled, as required in this

or in any street shall be piled and maintained in a manner as to eliminate
danger to those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the Street Superintendent shall have the
authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a
storage site and then re-haul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling.
It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal
sites.
   (B)   All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably
possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as specified by the Street
Superintendent. Whenever necessary, in order to expedite the flow of traffic or
to abate the dirt or dust nuisance, toe boards or bins may be required by the
Street Superintendent to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes.

the Street Superintendent. From time to time, as may be ordered by the Street
Superintendent, and in any event, immediately after completion of the work, the
permittee shall, at his or her or its own expense, clean up and remove all
refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from the work and upon
failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified to do so by the
Street Superintendent, the work may be done by the Superintendent and the cost
thereof charged to the permittee and the permittee shall also be liable for the
cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder.

§ 98.04 ENFORCEMENT; WARNINGS; REMOVAL AND CONFISCATION OF DEBRIS AND PERSONAL
PROPERTY.
   (A)   The Chief of Police, or their designee(s), will have primary
responsibility for the enforcement of the camping regulations herein. Nothing
in this chapter shall prevent the Police Chief, or their designee(s), from
obtaining voluntary compliance by way of warning, notice, education, or
coordination with other willing public or private entities and/or community
members.
      (1)   Prior to issuing any citation pursuant to this chapter, the
investigating officer shall provide a verbal and written warning to cease such
unlawful conduct and a verbal and written referral for possible alternatives to
their present camping practices, such as, (without limitation), transportation,
shelter, and/or contact information to public or private agencies who may be
able to provide services or support. Any public or private entities who wish to
assist the Maryville Police Department ("Department") in effectively and
humanely transitioning individuals from unauthorized encampments on public
property to an environment consistent with village ordinances should contact
the Department with a description of what services they can provide and
effective contact information. The Department will develop and maintain a
policy to include procedural guidance regarding the implementation of this
chapter. The Department shall consult relevant professional resources and
engage interested community members, service providers, or other willing public
or private entities when designing and implementing this policy. The policy
shall be published and implemented no later than six months after the passage
of this chapter. The policy shall provide for the collection of relevant data
that shall be used to review and revise the manual every three years, or as
needed. Said revision shall be made in the same manner the policy is developed.
      (2)   Police shall exercise discretion to ensure that individuals are not
cited for violating this chapter due only to a true personal necessity that
requires their present unauthorized camping practices. When possible, the
Department may work directly with community members, service providers or other
willing public or private entities to determine whether a true personal
necessity exists in a particular circumstance. The Department shall provide
specific support, guidance and contacts for officers. But it shall be evidence
that no true personal necessity exists if the individual who is camping refuses
to take advantage of proffered alternatives to their present camping practices
(which could include, in the most extreme cases, short term use of another
location more easily monitored by the Police).
      (3)   Upon a determination by law enforcement that an area constitutes an
unauthorized encampment, regardless of whether an individual is cited for a
violation of this chapter, village officials shall have the right to remove any
debris, contraband, or personal property that creates a legitimate health and
safety concern, or that creates an immediate and substantial danger to the
environment. No warning is required prior to such confiscation relating to
health and safety concerns.
      (4)   Materials confiscated pursuant to this chapter that are unsanitary
or a danger to the health and safety of any person may be immediately disposed
of. Otherwise, the Department shall provide 24 hour written notice prior to
confiscating property. The Department shall retain personal property
confiscated pursuant to this chapter in a manner consistent with the handling
of other confiscated property, and must not dispose of such personal property
for a period of at least 30 calendar days, during which time the owner may
retrieve such property from the Department, pursuant to the procedure outlined
in the policy. Nothing prevents Department members from disposing of property
with the consent of the property owner. When Department members have received
consent to dispose of property, village officials shall assist Department
members when necessary.

§ 98.99 PENALTIES.

by cash payment or community service.
   (B)   Any person who commits a subsequent violation of this chapter, which
occurred within 30 days of a violation, may be punishable by a fine of no more
than $500. All fines under this chapter may be satisfied by cash payment or
community service.
   (C)   Each occurrence of a violation of this chapter or, in the case of a
continuous violation, each day a violation occurs or continues, may constitute
a separate offense and may be punishable separately.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 116.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Cable Communications
Regulatory Code.”
(`92 Code, § 8-1-1) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.002 PURPOSE.
   (A)   (1)   The village finds that further development of cable systems has
the potential to be of great benefit to the village and its residents and
businesses. Cable technology is rapidly changing and cable plays an essential
role as part of the village’s basic infrastructure. Cable systems extensively
make use of scarce and valuable public rights-of-way, in a manner different
from the way in which the general public uses them, and in a manner reserved
primarily for those who provide services to the public, such as utility
companies. A cable company currently typically faces very limited competition;
thus, the grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive
economic benefits and places the holder in a position of public trust.
      (2)   Because of these facts, the village finds that public convenience,
safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers
vested in the village or such persons as the village so designates to protect
the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public
interest.
      (3)   In light of the foregoing, the following goals, among others,
underlie the provisions set forth in this code:
         (a)   Cable service should be available to as many village residents
and businesses as possible and provide the widest possible diversity of
information sources and services to the public.
         (b)   A cable system should be capable of accommodating both present
and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the community.
         (c)   A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a
franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum
extent possible into existing system facilities, taking into account all
relevant factors including costs.
         (d)   A cable system should grow and develop and be responsive to the
needs and interests of the community.
   (B)   The village intends that all provisions set forth in this code be
construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes and

any implicit rights other than those mandated by federal, state or local law.

preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems within the
village; affect the village’s right to authorize use of public rights-of-way by
other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it determines
appropriate; or affect the village’s right to itself construct, operate or
maintain a cable system, with or without a franchise; provided, however, that

comply with state law, including ILCS Chapter 65, Act 5, § 11-42-11.

all other duly enacted and applicable laws, shall define the rights and
obligations of the franchisee and the village relating to the franchise.
   (E)   All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to any
prior lawful occupancy of the public rights-of-way and the village reserves the
right to reasonably designate where a franchisee’s facilities are to be placed
within the public rights-of-way through its generally applicable permit
procedures without materially adding to the obligations of the franchisee.
   (F)   A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and
personal to the original franchisee. No franchise transfer shall occur without
the prior written consent of the village upon application made by the
franchisee pursuant to this code and the franchise agreement, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and any purported franchise transfer made
without application and prior written consent shall be void and shall be cause

under 47 USC § 552, all powers regarding zoning, supervision of construction,
assurance of equal employment opportunities, control of public rights-of-way
and consumer protection.
   (B)   No course of dealing between a franchisee and the village or any delay
on the part of the village in exercising any rights hereunder shall operate as

franchisee in contravention of the rights, except to the extent expressly
waived in writing or expressly provided for in a franchise agreement.

      (2)   Whether the quality of the applicant’s service under any franchises
in other communities, including signal quality, response to customer
complaints, billing practices and the like, was reasonable in light of the
needs and interest of the communities served;
      (3)   Whether there is adequate assurance that the applicant has the
financial, technical and legal qualifications to provide cable service in the
village;
      (4)   Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements
established by the village and is otherwise reasonably likely to meet the
future cable-related needs and interest of the community, taking into account
the cost of meeting such needs and interests;
      (5)   Whether there is adequate assurance the applicant will provide
suitable public, educational and governmental access facilities;
      (6)   Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted and in the public
interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-
way that would be used by the cable system, including the extent to which
installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or
involve disruption of property, public services or use of the public rights-of-
way; and
      (7)   Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or
controls any other cable system in the village or whether grant of the
application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable
service in the village.
   (C)   (1)   If the Village Board finds that it is in the public interest to
issue a franchise considering the factors set forth above, the village shall
prepare a final written franchise agreement under this code that incorporates,
as appropriate, the commitments made by the applicant and establish a deadline
for the applicant to sign it and submit it for approval.
      (2)   If the applicant signs the franchise agreement and timely submits
it for approval, the village shall issue a franchise by ordinance adopted no
less than 30 days after the filing of the original application.
   (D)   If the Village Board denies a franchise, it will issue a written
decision explaining why the franchise was denied.
   (E)   Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the Village
Board shall hold a public hearing; however, the village may reject without
hearing any application that is incomplete or fails to respond fully to an RFP.
   (F)   This code is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant
standing to challenge the issuance of a franchise to another person or to limit
the standing.
   (G)   If an application seeks authority for a franchise in addition to an
existing franchise, the village shall comply with state law, including ILCS
Chapter 65, Act 5, § 11-42-11.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-41) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.037 APPLICATION FOR GRANT OF RENEWAL.
   (A)   Applications for franchise renewal under the Cable Act shall be
received and reviewed in a manner consistent with § 626 of the Cable Act, 47
USC § 546.
   (B)   If neither a franchisee nor the village activates in a timely manner,
or can activate, the renewal process set forth in 47 USC § 546(a) through (g),
including, for example, if the provisions are repealed, and except as to
applications submitted pursuant to 47 USC § 546(h), the provisions of § 116.036
shall apply and a renewal request shall be evaluated using the same criteria as
any other request for a franchise.
   (C)   The following requirements shall apply to renewal requests properly
submitted pursuant to the Cable Act:
      (1)   (a)   If the provisions of 47 USC § 546(a) through (g) are properly
invoked, the Village Board shall, in accordance with the time limits of the
Cable Act, commence and complete a proceeding to review the applicant’s
performance under the franchise during the then current franchise term and to
identify future cable-related community needs and interests. Upon completion of
the proceeding, the Village Board may issue a RFP. The Village Board or its
designee shall establish deadlines and procedures for responding to the RFP,
may seek additional information from the applicant and shall establish
deadlines for the submission of additional information. Alternatively, an
applicant can submit a proposal for renewal on its own initiative.
         (b)   Following receipt of renewal proposals and additional
information, as may be provided in response to requests, the Village Board will
provide prompt notice of the proposals and thereafter either determine that the
franchise should be renewed or make a preliminary assessment that the franchise
should not be renewed. This determination shall be made in accordance with the
time limits established by the Cable Act, including sufficient time to comply
with the following procedures.
         (c)   If the Village Board preliminarily determines that the franchise
should not be renewed, which determination can be made by resolution, and the
applicant that submitted the renewal proposal notifies the Village Clerk in
writing within 20 days after receipt of the preliminary determination that it
wishes to pursue any rights to an administrative proceeding it has under the
Cable Act, then, if required, the Village Board shall commence ad
administrative proceeding after providing prompt public notice thereof, in
accordance with the Cable Act. The village may also commence such a proceeding
on its own initiative if it so chooses.
         (d)   If the Village Board decides to grant renewal, which decision
shall be made by resolution, the village shall prepare a final written
franchise agreement that incorporates, as appropriate, the commitments made by
the applicant in the renewal proposal and establish a deadline for the
applicant to sign it and submit it for approval. If the applicant signs the
franchise agreement and timely submits it for approval, the village shall issue
a franchise by ordinance. If the franchise agreement is not so accepted and
approved within the time limits established by 47 USC § 546(c)(1) and the
village, renewal shall thereupon be deemed preliminary denied, and if the
applicant notifies the Village Clerk, in writing, within 20 days after the
expiration of the time limit established by 47 USC § 546(c)(1) that it wishes
to pursue any rights to an administrative proceeding it has under the Cable
Act, then, if required, the Village Board shall commence an administrative
proceeding after providing prompt public notice thereof, in accordance with the
Cable Act. The village may also commence such a proceeding on its own
initiative if it so chooses.
      (2)   If an administrative proceeding is commenced pursuant to 47 USC §
546(c), the applicant’s renewal proposal shall be evaluated considering such
matters as may be considered consistent with federal law. The following
procedures shall apply:
         (a)   The Village Board shall, by resolution, appoint an
administrative hearing officer or officers, referred to hereafter as “hearing
officer.” The Village Board may appoint itself or one or more of its members as
hearing officer or any other qualified person.
         (b)   The hearing officer shall establish a schedule for proceeding
which allows for written discovery (requests for admissions, production of
documents and interrogatory responses), production of evidence and subpoenaing
and cross-examination of witnesses. Depositions shall not be permitted unless
the party requesting the deposition shows that written discovery and hearing
subpoena will not provide it an adequate opportunity to require the production
of evidence necessary to present its case. The hearing officer shall have the
authority to require the production of evidence as the interests of justice may
require, including to require the production of evidence by the applicant that
submitted the renewal proposal and any affiliate of the applicant. The hearing
officer shall not prohibit discovery on the ground that evidence sought is
proprietary or involves business secrets, but rather shall issue protective
orders which allow reasonable and necessary discovery without making the
information available to competitors. Any order of the hearing officer may be
enforced by imposing appropriate sanctions in the administrative hearing or by
action of the Village Board.
         (c)   The hearing officer may conduct a pre-hearing conference and
establish appropriate pre-hearing orders. The village and the applicant shall
be the only parties. The village may have special counsel to represent its
interests at the hearing so that the Village Attorney may advise the Village
Board as it makes its decision.
         (d)   The hearing officer may require the village and the applicant to
submit prepared written testimony prior to the hearing. Unless the parties
agree otherwise, the applicant shall present evidence first, the village shall
present evidence second and the applicant shall be allowed the opportunity to
present rebuttal evidence. Any reports or the transcript or summary of any
proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 USC § 546(a) shall for purposes of the
administrative hearing be regarded no differently than any other evidence. The
village and the applicant must be afforded full procedural protection regarding
evidence related to these proceedings, including the right to refute any
evidence introduced in these proceedings or sought to be introduced by the
other party. Both shall have the opportunity to submit additional evidence
related to issues raised in the proceeding conducted pursuant to 47 USC § 546
(a).
         (e)   There shall be a transcribed proceeding during which each party
will be allowed to present testimony (live or written if so required) and
cross-examine the witnesses of the other party.
         (f)   Following completion of any hearing, the hearing officer shall
require the parties to submit proposed findings of fact with respect to the
matters that the Village Board is entitled to consider in determining whether
renewal ought to be granted. Based on the record of the hearing, the hearing
officer shall then prepare written findings with respect to those matters, and
submit those findings including a decision and the reasons therefor, to the
Village Board and to the parties unless the hearing officer is the Village
Board, in which case the written findings shall constitute the final decision
of the village.
         (g)   If the hearing officer is not the Village Board, the parties
shall have 30 days from the date the findings are submitted to the Village
Board to file exceptions to those findings. The Village Board shall thereafter
issue a written decision granting or denying the application for renewal,
consistent with the requirements of the Cable Act, based on the record of the
proceeding, stating the reason for the decision. A copy of the final decision
of the Village Board shall be provided to the parties.
         (h)   The proceeding shall be conducted with due speed. Any decision
to renew a franchise shall be made by ordinance enacted no less than 30 days
after the filing of the application and subsequent to preparation of a written
franchise agreement consistent with the decision by the village and signature
thereof by the applicant.
         (i)   In conducting the proceeding, and except as inconsistent with
the foregoing, the hearing officer will follow the Illinois Administrative
Procedures Act, ILCS Chapter 5, Act 100, §§ 1-1 et seq., as amended. The
hearing officer may request that the Village Board adopt additional reasonable
and necessary procedures and requirements by resolution.
      (3)   This section does not prohibit any franchisee from submitting or
the village from considering an informal renewal application pursuant to 47 USC
§ 546(h), which application may be granted or denied in accordance with the
provisions of 47 USC § 546(h). If an informal renewal application is granted,
including during the course of formal renewal proceedings, then the steps
specified in divisions (C)(1) and (2) above need not be taken, notwithstanding
the provisions of those divisions. However, the village will provide the public
with adequate notice before making a decision on an application, and will make
any decision to renew by ordinance enacted no less than 30 days after the
filing of the application, and subsequent to the preparation of a written
franchise agreement by the village and signature thereof by the applicant.
Unless otherwise directed by the village, an informal renewal application shall
contain the information required under §
116.038.
      (4)   The provisions of this code shall be read and applied so that they
are consistent with § 626 of the Cable Act, 47 USC § 546, as amended.

(`92 Code, § 8-1-43) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.039 APPLICATION FOR FRANCHISE MODIFICATION.
   (A)   An application for modification of a franchise agreement shall
include, at minimum, the following information:
      (1)   The specific modification requested;
      (2)   The justification for the requested modification, including the
impact of the requested modification on subscribers and others, and the
financial impact on the applicant if the modification is approved or

      (3)   A statement whether the modification is sought pursuant to § 625 of

more shall be processed through formal or informal renewal procedures.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-44) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.040 FRANCHISE TRANSFERS.
   (A)   Village approval required. No franchise transfer shall occur without
prior written application to and written approval of the Village Board by
ordinance enacted after a public hearing and only then upon such terms and
conditions as the Village Board reasonably deems necessary and proper. Approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any purported franchise transfer made
without the prior approval shall be void and shall be cause for the village to
revoke the franchise agreement. A grant of a franchise involves personal
credit, trust and confidence in the franchisee and franchise transfer without
the prior written approval of the Village Board shall be considered to impair
the village’s assurance of due performance. The granting of approval for a
franchise transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any
subsequent franchise transfer.
   (B)   Application.
      (1)   The franchisee shall promptly notify the Village Clerk in writing
of any proposed franchise transfer. If any franchise transfer should take place
without prior notice to the village, the franchisee will promptly notify the
Village Clerk in writing that such a franchise transfer has occurred.
      (2)   At least 120 calendar days prior to the contemplated effective date
of a franchise transfer, the franchisee shall submit to the Village Clerk an
application for approval of the franchise transfer. Such an application shall
provide information on the proposed transaction, including details on the
legal, financial, technical and other qualifications of the transferee, any
waivers required from the village under applicable law, and on the potential
impact of the franchise transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a minimum,
the following information must be included in the application:
         (a)   All information and forms required under federal law;
         (b)   All information described in §
116.038, regarding the transferee instead of the applicant and regarding the
franchise transfer rather than initial or renewal franchise;
         (c)   A description of any business relationships or transactions of
any kind, past, present or anticipated, between the franchisee, or its owners
or affiliates, and the transferee or its owners or affiliates, other than the
proposed transaction;
         (d)   Any contracts, financing documents or other documents that
relate to the proposed transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits or
the like referred to therein;
         (e)   A description of the sources and amounts of the funds to be used
in the proposed transaction, indicating how the debt-equity ratio of the system
will change in the course of the transaction; what entities will be liable for
repayment of any debt incurred; what interest, payment schedule and other terms
or conditions will apply to any debt financing; any debt coverages or financial
ratios any potential transferees will be required to maintain over the
franchise term if the proposed transaction is approved; what financial
resources would be available to the system under the control of the proposed
transferee;
         (f)   Any other information necessary to provide a complete and
accurate understanding of the financial position of the system before and after
the proposed franchise transfer, including, but not limited to projected income
statements and cash flow statements, including capital investments, for at
least five years after the proposed franchise transfer, assuming the franchise
transfer is approved, stating specifically what assumptions are being made with
respect to any rebuild or upgrade of the system;
         (g)   A statement that the franchisee is in compliance with its
franchise obligations over the term of the franchise or specific descriptions
of any noncompliance of which the franchisee or any potential transferee is
aware.
      (3)   For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a
franchise transfer, the Village Board and its agents may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee and the other matters as the
Village Board may deem necessary to determine whether the franchise transfer is
in the public interest and should be approved or denied. The franchisee and any
prospective transferees shall assist the Village Board in any such inquiry, and
if they fail to reasonably cooperate, the request for approval of franchise
transfer may be denied. Proprietary information shall be protected from
disclosure to competitors to the extent permitted by law.
   (C)   Determination by village.
      (1)   In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant
subject to conditions an application for approval of a franchise transfer, the
Village Board shall consider the legal, financial and technical qualifications
of the transferee to operate the system; whether any required waivers under the
applicable law are in the best interests of the public; whether the franchisee
is in compliance with its franchise agreement and this code and, if not, the
proposed transferee’s commitment to cure the non- compliance; and whether
operation by the transferee on approval of the franchise transfer would
adversely affect the village’s interest under this code, the franchise
agreement, other applicable law or the public interest or make it less likely
that the future cable-related needs and interests of the community would be
satisfied.
      (2)   The village shall make its determination in accordance with any
time limits imposed by federal law, including under 47 USC § 537.
      (3)   Any purported franchise transfer made without the Village Board’s
prior written approval shall be void, and shall make a franchise subject to
revocation at the Village Board’s sole discretion, and make any other remedies
available to the village under the franchise or other applicable law.
Acceptance of filing of an application for approval of a franchise transfer
later than 120 days before the purported effective date of the franchise
transfer shall not validate the transaction or excuse the late filing and in
such an instance the village shall retain the right to make its decision
regarding a franchise transfer within 120 days unless action is required sooner
by law.
   (D)   Transferee’s agreement. No application for approval of a franchise
transfer shall be granted unless and until the proposed transferee submits an
agreement in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this code
and the franchise agreement and that it will assume the obligations and
liabilities, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee under this code and
the franchise agreement for all purposes, including renewal, unless the Village
Board approves a modification of the franchise agreement pursuant to § 116.03
in conjunction with its approval of the franchise transfer, in which case the
proposed transferee’s agreement shall refer to the franchise agreement as so
modified.
   (E)   Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the Village Board of
a franchise transfer does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the
rights of the village under this code or a franchise agreement, whether arising
before or after the date of the franchise transfer; however, upon approval of a
franchise transfer, the former franchisee shall be released from prospective
liability under the franchise.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-45) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.041 FILING FEES AND DEPOSITS.
   (A)   To be acceptable for filing, an application hereunder shall be
accompanied by a filing fee in the following amounts to cover the village’s
internal administrative costs incidental to the franchising process:
      (1)   For a initial franchise: $1,000.

connection with the evaluation of its application and shall be given an
opportunity to be heard thereat. Notice of all public proceedings of the
village shall be published and posted in accordance with its usual practices.

§ 116.042 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION.
   By resolution of the Village Board, any part or all of the process
established by this subchapter may be conducted in concert with other political
subdivisions served or to be served by the applicant.

CONSTRUCTION PROVISIONS
§ 116.055 SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE.
   (A)   (1)   Every franchise agreement shall specify the construction
schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade or rebuild of
the cable system. Failure on the part of a franchisee to commence and
diligently pursue the requirements and complete the matters set forth in its
franchise agreement or to comply with the system design and construction plan
submitted to the village, including by providing the equipment specified or its
equivalent and by following generally accepted installation practices, except
insofar as those plans or practices, if carried out, would result in
construction of a system which could not meet requirements of federal, state or
local law; and except for minor modifications as are typical in the industry,
shall be grounds for revocation of its franchise under and pursuant to the
terms of § 116.179.
      (2)   The Village Board, in its discretion, may extend the time for the
completion of construction and installation for additional periods by
resolution in the event a franchisee, acting in good faith, experiences delays
by reason of circumstances beyond its control and requests an extension in
writing.
   (B)   A franchisee’s failure to comply with provisions of the construction
plan approved by the Village Board shall also be grounds for imposition of
penalties pursuant to § 116.999.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-50) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.056 CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   A franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain the cable system
subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the village who have
jurisdiction in such matters, and in compliance with all laws, ordinances,
departmental rules and regulations affecting the system.
   (B)   The system, and all parts thereof, shall be subject to periodic
inspection by the village.
   (C)   (1)   No construction, reconstruction or relocation of the system or
any part thereof within the public rights-of-way shall be commenced until
written permits have been obtained from the proper village officials.
      (2)   In any permit so issued, the officials may impose the conditions
and regulations as a condition of the granting of the permit as are reasonably
necessary for the purpose of protecting any structures or facilities in the
public rights-of-way and for the proper restoration of the public rights-of-
way and structures and facilities, and for the protection of the public and the
continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (D)   The Village Board may by resolution or ordinance, from time to time,
issue such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the construction,
operation and maintenance of the system as are consistent with the provisions
of this code and franchises issued pursuant to this code.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-51) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.057 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   (1)   The construction, operation, maintenance and repair of a cable
system shall be in accordance with all applicable sections of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act of 1970; the National Electrical Safety Code; the
National Electric Code; National Cable Television Association Standards of Good
Engineering Practices; Obstruction Marking and Lighting, Federal Aviation
Administration; Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structures,

limitation, local zoning and construction codes and laws and accepted industry
practices, all as hereafter may be amended or adopted.
      (2)   In the event of a conflict among codes and standards, the most
stringent code or standard shall apply, except insofar as that code or
standard, if followed, would result in a system that could not meet
requirements of federal, state or local law.
      (3)   The village may adopt additional reasonable standards as required
to ensure that work continues to be performed in an orderly and workmanlike
manner or to reflect changes in standards which may occur over a franchise
term.
   (B)   All wires, cable lines and other transmission lines, equipment and

other applicable federal, state or local laws, codes and regulations, all as
hereafter may be amended or adopted.
   (E)   Without limiting the foregoing, all of a franchisee’s plant and
equipment, including, but not limited to the antennae site, head end and
distribution system, towers, house connections, structures, poles, wires,
cable, coaxial cable, fiber, optic cable, fixtures and apparatuses shall be
installed, located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed,
repaired, maintained and operated in accordance with good engineering
practices, performed by experienced and properly trained maintenance and
construction personnel so as not to endanger any person or property or to
unreasonably interfere in any manner with the public rights-of-way or legal
rights of any property owner including the village or unnecessarily hinder or
obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
   (F)   All safety practices required by law shall be used during
construction, maintenance and repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall
install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices to prevent
failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to
the public.
   (G)   A franchisee shall not place facilities, equipment or fixtures where
they will interfere with any cable, gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer or
other utility facilities, or obstruct or hinder in any manner the various
utilities serving the residents and businesses in the village of their use of
any public rights-of- way.
   (H)   Any and all public rights-of-way, public property or private property
disturbed or damaged during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation,
operation, maintenance or construction of a system shall be repaired or
replaced by the franchisee within a reasonable time specified by the village.
   (I)   A franchisee shall, by a reasonable time specified by the village,
protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove discrete portions
of its property when required by the village by reason of traffic conditions;
public safety, public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way
maintenance or repair (including resurfacing or widening); change of public
right-of-way grade; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains,
water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks or any other type of government-
owned utility; public right-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the
convenience of the village would be reasonably served thereby; provided,
however, that the franchisee may abandon any property in place if approved by
the village in writing, and provided further that the franchisee shall not be
required to make permanent changes in its facilities to accommodate the
installation of another cable system, nor should it be required to make
temporary changes solely to disrupt its business or otherwise provide an unfair
advantage to a competitor. No action hereunder shall be deemed a taking of the
property of a franchisee and a franchisee shall not be entitled to any
compensation therefor. No location of any pole or wire-holding structure of a
franchisee shall be a vested interest.
   (J)   (1)   If any action under the preceding paragraph is reasonably
required to accommodate the construction, operation or repair of the facilities
of another person that is authorized to use the public rights-of-way, a
franchisee shall, after 30 days’ advance written notice, take action to effect
the necessary changes requested. The franchisee shall be reimbursed by such
other person for costs reasonably incurred in taking the action. The Village
Board may resolve disputes as to responsibility for costs associated with the
removal, relaying or relocation of facilities as among entities authorized to
install facilities in the public rights-of-way if the parties are unable to do
so themselves, and if the matter is not governed by a valid contract between
the parties.
      (2)   All charges shall be consistent with ILCS Chapter 65, Act 5, § 11-
42-11.
   (K)   In the event of an emergency or where a cable system creates or is
contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety or property, the village
may remove, relay or relocate the pertinent parts of that cable system without
prior notice. No charge shall be made by franchisee against the village for
restoration and repair.
   (L)   A franchisee shall, on the request of the village or any person
holding a permit issued by the village, temporarily raise or lower its wires to
permit the moving of buildings or oversized vehicles. The expense of the
temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person
requesting same and the franchisee shall have the authority to require the
payment in advance, except in the case where the request is made by the village
on its own behalf, in which case no payment shall be required. The franchisee
shall be given not less than 48 hours’ advance notice to arrange for the
temporary wire changes unless the Village Board has declared an emergency. All
charges shall be consistent with ILCS Chapter 65, Act 5, § 11-42-11.
   (M)   A franchisee shall have the authority to trim trees that overhand a
public right-of-way of the village so as to prevent the branches of such trees
from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the franchisee, at its own
expense subject to the supervision and direction of the village. Trimming of
trees on private property shall require written permission of the property
owner. All cut materials shall be property disposed.
   (N)   A franchisee shall use, with the owner’s permission, existing
underground conduits or overhead utility facilities whenever feasible and may
not erect poles in public rights-of-way without the express written permission
of the Village Board, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Copies of agreements for use of conduits or other facilities shall be filed
with the Village Clerk as required by a franchise agreement or upon village
request.
   (O)   (1)   Trunk, feeder and drop cable may be constructed overhead where
poles exist and electric, cable television or telephone lines are overhead, but
where no overhead lines exist all trunk, feeder and drop cable shall be
constructed underground. Whenever and wherever all electric lines and telephone
lines are moved from overhead to underground placement, all cable system cables
shall be similarly moved and the cost of movement of its cable shall be solely
the obligation of the franchisee. In cases of new construction or property
development where utilities are to be placed underground, on request of
franchisee the developer or property owner shall give a franchisee reasonable
notice of the particular date on which open trenching will be available to
franchisee for installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults and laterals to
be provided at the franchisee’s expense. The franchisee shall also provide
specifications as needed for trenching.
      (2)   Costs of trenching and easements required to bring facilities
within the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner,
except that if the franchisee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or
vaults and laterals within five working days of the date the trenches are
available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or property
owner, then should the trenches be closed after the five-day period, the cost
of new trenching is to be borne by the franchisee.
   (P)   The village shall have the right to install and maintain free of
charge upon any poles or within any conduit owned by a franchisee any wire and
pole fixtures that do not reasonably interfere with the cable system operations
of the franchisee.
   (Q)   Prior to construction or rebuild of a cable system, a franchisee shall
first submit to the Village Board for approval a concise description of the
cable system proposed to be erected or installed, including engineering
drawings, if required by the Village Board, together with a map and plans
indicating the proposed location of all facilities and obtain written approval
therefor from the Village Board, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
   (R)   Any contractor or subcontractor used for work or construction,
installation, operation, maintenance or repair of system equipment must be
properly licensed under laws of the state and all applicable local ordinances
and each contractor or subcontractor shall have the same obligations with
respect to its work as a franchisee would have under the franchise agreement
and applicable laws if the work were performed by the franchisee. The
franchisee must ensure that contractors, subcontractors and all employees who
will perform work for it are trained and experienced. The franchisee shall be
responsible for ensuring that the work of contractors and subcontractors is
performed consistent with the franchise and applicable law, shall be fully
responsible for all acts or omissions of contractors or subcontractors, shall
be responsible for promptly correcting acts or omissions by any contractor or
subcontractor and shall implement a quality control program to ensure that the
work is properly performed.
   (S)   Upon failure of a franchisee to commence, pursue or complete any work
required by law or by the provisions of this code to be done in any street,
within the time prescribed and to the reasonable satisfaction of the village,
the village may, at its option, after 30 days notice to franchisee, cause the
work to be done and the franchisee shall pay to the village the cost thereof in
the itemized amounts reported by the village to franchisee within 30 days after
receipt of the itemized report.
   (T)   The franchisee shall make no paving cuts or curb cuts, except after
written permission has been given by the village, which permission shall not
unreasonably be withheld.
   (U)   The franchisee shall install in conduit all cable passing under any
major roadway.

§ 116.058 AREA SERVED.
   A franchisee shall build and maintain its system so that within a reasonable
period of time, as established by the franchise, it is able to provide service
to all households desiring service located within the franchise area without
any construction charges, other than standard connection charges and drop
charges as indicated in § 116.059(B). A franchisee must build and maintain its
system so that it can extend service to households desiring service located
outside the franchise area in accordance with § 116.059(A) through (D).
Connections to commercial customers shall be governed by § 116.059(E).
(`92 Code, § 8-1-53) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
Penalty, see § 116.999
§ 116.059 LINE EXTENSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   For areas within the village, but outside the franchise area,
including areas annexed after the effective date of its franchise, subject to
ILCS Chapter 55, Act 5, § 5-1095, a franchisee shall upon request of the
Village Board extend its trunk and distribution system to serve households
desiring service without any construction charge, other than standard
connection charges and drop charges as indicated in division (B) below, unless
the franchisee demonstrates to the Village Board’s satisfaction evidenced by
written decision that circumstances justify a specific charge, where the new
subscriber requesting service is located within 500 feet from the termination
of the cable system or the number of potential subscribers to be passed by the
extension is equal to or greater than six potential households per quarter mile
measured from any point on the system.
      (2)   In the event that the requirements set forth in the foregoing
division (A)(1) above are not met, the franchisee shall, on request of the
Village Board, extend its cable system based upon the following cost-sharing
formula. The franchisee shall contribute an amount equal to the construction
costs per mile multiplied by the length of the extension in miles, multiplied
by a fraction where the numerator equals the number of potential households per
quarter mile at the time of the request and the denominator equals six.
Households requesting service as of the completion of construction can be
required to bear the remainder of the total construction costs on a pro rata
basis.
      (3)   (a)   The “construction costs” are defined as the actual turnkey
cost to construct the entire extension including lines, materials, electronics,
pole make-ready charges and labor, but not the cost of drops except as provided
below. If the franchisee proposes to require a household requesting extension
to make a contribution in aid of extension, it must:
            1.   Notify the Village Board in advance;
            2.   Send the Village Board a copy of the invoice showing the
amount actually charged each household requesting extension; and
            3.   Within 30 days of completion of the extension, furnish proof
of the total cost of the extension and make any appropriate refunds if the
total cost is less than the amounts charged in advance of construction.
         (b)   At the end of each calendar year, the franchisee must calculate
the amount any contributing person would have paid based on the number of
persons served at that time and pay back the difference between the amount
actually collected from that person and the amount which would then be owed.
The franchisee shall report such calculations and refunds to the Village Clerk
by the end of January of the following year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as federal rate regulations may otherwise require, the
franchisee shall not assess any additional cost for service drops of 150 feet
or less unless the franchise demonstrates to the Village Board’s satisfaction,
evidenced by written decision, that circumstances justify a specific charge.
      (2)   Where a drop exceeds 150 feet in length, a franchisee may charge
the subscriber for the difference between franchisee’s actual costs associated
with installing a 150-foot drop and the franchisee’s actual cost of installing
the longer drop, provided that drop length shall be the shorter of the actual
length of installed drop or the shortest practicable distance to the point
where the franchisee would be required to extend its distribution system.
   (C)   Except as federal rate regulations may otherwise require, in any area
where a franchisee would be entitled to install a drop above ground, the
franchisee will provide the subscriber the option to have the drop installed
underground, but may charge the subscriber the difference between the actual
cost of the above-ground installation and the actual cost of the underground
installation.
   (D)   A franchisee must extend service to any person who requests it within
seven days of the request within the franchise area or where service can be
provided by activating or installing a drop within 150 feet of the existing
distribution system; within 90 days of the request for service outside the
franchise area where an extension of mile or less, but more than 150 feet, is
required; or within six months for service outside the franchise area where an
extension of mile or more is required.
   (E)   Because existing conditions can vary dramatically, the franchisee may,
in its discretion, require commercial customers to pay all reasonable costs,
including time and materials, in excess of the average cost of connection for
residential services.

§ 116.060 SYSTEM TESTS AND INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   A franchisee shall perform the following tests to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of the franchise and other performance
standards established by federal law. All tests shall be conducted in
accordance with federal rules and in accordance with the most recent edition of
NCTA’s “Recommended Practices for Measurements on Cable Television Systems” or
if no recent edition exists, such other appropriate manual as the parties may
designate.
      (1)   Preconstruction quality control on cable and equipment. A
franchisee shall perform preconstruction quality tests on system components. In
case of passive components, this will include testing a significant sample of
devices to verify compliance with manufacturer’s specifications.
         (a)   All trunk and distribution cable shall be sweep-tested on the
reels to verify compliance with manufacturer’s specifications for frequency
response and loss.
         (b)   All trunk and distribution amplifiers shall be bench-tested to
verify compliance with manufacturer’s specifications.
         (c)   No component shall be used in the system which fails to meet
manufacturer’s specifications. A franchisee shall maintain, in the county,
records of all preconstruction tests, which the village may inspect during
normal business hours on reasonable notice.
      (2)   Acceptance tests. A franchisee shall perform acceptance tests prior
to subscriber connection. The tests shall demonstrate that the system
components are operating as expected. The test results shall be submitted to
the Village Clerk for review by the village. The franchisee shall have the
obligation, without further notice from village, to take corrective action if
any system components are not operating as expected. Unless the village
determines test results are not adequate to demonstrate system compliance with
the standards described above and objects within three working days of receipt
of the test results, the portion of the system covered by the tests will be
deemed approved for subscriber connection.
      (3)   Continuing tests.
         (a)   The franchisee shall select locations at the extremities of the
system to install equipment to establish sufficient permanent test points in
accordance with federal law and sound engineering practices. The franchisee
shall perform proof of performance tests at these locations at least once every
six months through the life of the franchise, except as federal law otherwise
limits its obligation, and at other times and points where complaints indicate
tests are warranted. The tests shall demonstrate system compliance with
technical specifications established pursuant to franchise, or other applicable
law. If the village requests to witness the tests, it shall be notified in
writing delivered to the Village Clerk at least 48 hours in advance of any
testing.
         (b)   A written report of all test results shall be kept on file by
the franchisee and provided to the Village Clerk on request. If a location
fails to meet performance specifications, the franchisee shall take corrective
action and retest the location. The village shall have the option of witnessing
the follow-up tests and shall be notified in writing delivered to the Village
Clerk at least 48 hours in advance of any such follow-up testing.
         (c)   At any time after commencement of service to subscribers the
village may require additional tests, full or partial repeat tests, different
test procedures or tests involving a specific subscriber’s terminal. Requests
for additional tests will be made on the basis of complaints received or other
evidence indicating an unresolved controversy or significant non-compliance and
the tests will be limited to the particular matter in controversy. The village
may conduct such tests independently on three days advance notice to
franchisee. The village will endeavor to so arrange its requests for the
special tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the franchisee and
the subscriber(s).
      (4)   Summaries included. All reports of test results shall include
executive summaries.
      (5)   Performance criteria. Test procedures used in verification of the
performance criteria set forth herein, if not as set forth in § 76.609, Subpart
K of the FCC Rules and Regulations, shall be in accordance with good
engineering practice and shall be fully described in an attachment to the
annual certificate filed with the village.
      (6)   Combines reports. To the extent that the report of measurements as
required above may be combined with any reports of measurements required by the
FCC or other regulatory agencies, the village shall accept combined reports,
provided that all standards and measurements herein or hereafter established by
the village are satisfied.
   (B)   The village may conduct inspections of the system, including to assess
compliance with the construction and installation practices manuals and design
plans. The franchisee shall be notified in writing of any violations found
during the course of inspections. The franchisee must bring violations into
compliance within 30 days of the date notice of violation is given, and must
submit a report to the Village Clerk describing the steps taken to bring itself
into compliance. Inspection does not relieve the franchisee of its obligation
to build in compliance with all provisions of the franchise.

CONSUMER PROTECTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVISIONS
§ 116.115 TELEPHONE AND OFFICE AVAILABILITY.
   (A)   Each franchisee shall maintain an office at a convenient location to
subscribers, not necessarily within the franchise area, that shall be open
during normal business hours to allow subscribers to request service, pay bills
and conduct other business. Each franchisee shall perform service calls,
installations and disconnects at least during normal business hours, provided
that a franchisee shall respond to outages 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Outage reports should be addressed within 24 hours. Each franchisee shall
establish a publicly listed local toll-free telephone number. The phone must be
answered by customer service representatives at least during normal business
hours for the purpose of receiving requests for service, inquiries and
complaints from subscribers; after those hours a franchisee shall arrange for
the phone to be answered so that customers can register complaints and report
service problems on a 24-hour per day, seven day per week basis, and so that
the franchisee can respond to service outages as required herein.
   (B)   Under normal operating conditions, telephone answering time shall not
exceed 30 seconds or four rings and the time to transfer the call to a customer
service representative, including hold time, shall not exceed an additional 30
seconds. Under normal operating conditions a customer will receive a busy
signal less than 3% of the time. These standards shall be met 90% of the time,
measured quarterly. When the business office is closed, an answering machine or
service capable of receiving and recording service complaints and inquiries
shall be employed. The after-hours answering service shall comply with the same
telephone answer time standard set forth in this section. Upon request by the
village, franchisee shall supply information demonstrating that it is meeting
the standards set forth herein.
   (C)   A franchisee must hire sufficient staff so that it can adequately
respond to customer inquiries, complaints and requests for service in its
office, over the phone, and at the subscriber’s residence.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-81) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.116 SCHEDULING WORK.
   (A)   All appointments for service, installation or disconnection shall be
specified by date. Each franchisee shall specify a specific time at which the
work shall be done, or offer a choice of time blocks, which shall not exceed
four hours in length unless the subscriber agrees to a longer period of time.
The franchisee may also, upon request, offer service installation calls outside
normal business hours, for the express convenience of the customer. If at any
time an installer or technician believes it impossible to make a scheduled
appointment time, an attempt to contact the customer will be made prior to the
time of appointment and the appointment rescheduled at a time convenience to
the customer.
   (B)   (1)   Subscribers who have experienced two missed appointments due to
the fault of a franchisee shall receive installation free of charge, if the
appointment was for installation.
      (2)   If an installation was to have been provided free of charge, or for
other appointments, the subscriber shall receive a 50% discount on one month of
basic cable service tier or its equivalent.
   (C)   With regard to mobility-limited customers, upon subscriber request,
each franchisee shall arrange for pickup and/or replacement of converters or
other franchisee equipment at the subscriber’s address or by a satisfactory
equivalent (such as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer).
   (D)   Under normal operating conditions, requests for service, repair and
maintenance must be acknowledged by a trained customer service representative
within 24 hours, or prior to the end of the next business day, whichever is
earlier. A franchisee shall respond to all other inquiries, including billing
inquiries, within five business days of the inquiry or complaint.
   (E)   Under normal operating conditions, installations made within 150 feet
of the existing distribution system shall be completed within seven business
days after the order is placed. Repairs and maintenance for service
interruptions and other customer location repairs must be completed within 24
hours, or if it is not possible to be complete the work within 24 hours, then
work must have commenced within the time period and be diligently continued
thereafter until completed. Work on all other requests for service on
franchisee’s facilities must be begun by the next business day after
notification of the problem and must be completed within three days from the
date of the initial request, except installation requests, provided that a
franchisee shall complete the work in the shortest time possible where, for
reasons beyond the franchisee’s control, the work could not be completed in
those time periods even with the exercise of all due diligence; the failure of
a franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff shall not
justify a franchisee’s failure to comply with this provision. Except as federal
law permits, no charge shall be made to the subscriber for this service, unless
required due to damage caused by a subscriber.
   (F)   The franchisee shall not cancel a service or installation appointment
with a customer after the close of business on the business day preceding the
appointment.
   (G)   The standards of divisions (D) and (E) above shall be met at least 95%
of the time, measured on a quarterly basis.

subscribers and the village at least 30 days’ notice of any significant changes
in the information required to be provided by this section. The notice shall be
in writing and by announcement on the system. The franchisee may provide notice
of service and rate changes to subscribers using any reasonable written means
at its sole discretion. The franchisee need not provide prior notice of any
rate change that is the result of a regulatory fee, franchise fee or any other
fee, tax, assessment or charge of any kind imposed by any federal agency, state
or franchising authority on the transaction between the franchisee and the
subscriber.
   (C)   All franchisee promotional materials, announcements and advertising of
residential cable service to subscribers and the general public, where price
information is listed in any manner, shall clearly and accurately disclose
price terms. In the case of pay-per-view or pay-per-event programming, all
promotional materials must clearly and accurately disclose price terms and in
the case of telephone orders, a franchisee shall take appropriate steps to
ensure that the customer service representative clearly and accurately disclose
price terms to potential customers in advance of taking the order.
   (D)   Each franchisee shall maintain a public file containing all notices
provided to subscribers under these customer service standards, as well as all
written promotional offers made to subscribers.

§ 116.118 INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE.
   A franchisee may intentionally interrupt service on the cable system only
for good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency
situations, only after a minimum of 48 hours’ prior notice to subscribers and
the village of the anticipated service interruption; provided, however, that
planned maintenance that occurs between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00
a.m. shall not require the notice to subscribers, so long as notice to the
village is given no less than 24 hours prior to an anticipated service
interruption.

   (A)   A franchisee’s first billing statement after a new installation or
service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security
deposit.
   (B)   A franchisee’s billing statement must be clear, concise and
understandable, must itemize each category of service and equipment provided to
the subscriber and must state clearly the charge therefor.
   (C)   A franchisee’s billing statement must be mailed on or before the first
day of the month (or equivalent period) and must show a specific payment due
date not earlier than the fifteenth day of the month (or equivalent period) in
which the service being billed is rendered. Any balance not received within 15
days after the due date may be assessed a reasonable processing charge based on
costs and/or a late fee. Late fees shall not exceed .75% per month.
   (D)   A franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit
payment in person at the franchisee’s office(s) and inform the subscriber of
the address of the office(s).
   (E)   Subscribers shall not be charged a processing fee or late fee or be
otherwise penalized for any failure by a franchisee, including failure to
timely or correctly bill the subscriber or failure to properly credit the
subscriber for a payment timely made.
   (F)   On request, the account of any subscriber shall be credited a prorated
share of the monthly charge for the service if the subscriber is without
service or if service is substantially impaired for any reason for a period
exceeding four hours during any 24-hour period, except where it can be
documented that a subscriber seeks a refund for an outage or impairment which
that subscriber caused, or in the case of a planned outage occurring between
the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. of which the village received the
required prior notice.
   (G)   The franchisee shall respond to all written billing complaints from
subscribers within 30 days.
   (H)   Refund checks to subscribers shall be issued no later than:
      (1)   The subscriber’s next billing cycle following resolution of the
refund request; or
      (2)   The date of return of all equipment to the franchisee, if service
has been terminated.
   (I)   Credits for service shall be issued no later than the subscriber’s

subscriber who so requests by giving at least one-day notice and reasonably
cooperating with the franchisee regarding the removal of the franchisee’s
equipment from the subscriber’s location.
      (2)   No charge may be imposed for any voluntary disconnection and
downgrade charges must comply with the requirements of federal law. No charge
may be imposed by any franchisee for any cable service delivered after the
requested date of disconnection.
   (C)   A subscriber may be asked, but not required to disconnect a
franchisee’s equipment and return it to the nearest business office.
   (D)   Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be

franchisee. The refund process shall take a maximum of 30 days, from the date
disconnection was requested to the date the customer receives the refund.
   (E)   If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber or other fee or
charge, a franchisee may disconnect the subscriber’s service outlet; however,
the disconnection shall not be effected until after 30 days from the due date.
If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before the date
scheduled for disconnection, the franchisee shall not disconnect service. After
disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all fees or charges
due, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, and any
reasonable security deposit, the franchisee shall promptly reinstate service on
request.
   (F)   A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber
is damaging or destroying the franchisee’s cable system or equipment. After
disconnection, the franchisee shall restore service after the subscriber
provides adequate assurance that it has ceased the practices that led to
disconnection, and paid all proper fees and charges, including any reconnect
fees and amounts owed the franchisee for damage to its cable system or
equipment and any reasonable security deposit.
   (G)   A franchisee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes signal
leakage in excess of federal limits. It may do so without notice, provided that

its property from a subscriber’s premises within 60 days of the termination of
service, voluntarily or involuntarily. If a franchisee fails to remove its
property in that period, the property shall be deemed abandoned.

§ 116.121 CHANGES IN SERVICE.
   (A)   (1)   Before a franchisee unilaterally alters the service it provides
to a class of subscribers, it must provide the village and each affected
subscriber 30 days’ written notice, by any reasonable means at its sole
discretion, explain the substance and full effect of the alteration, and
provide the subscriber the right within the 30-day period following notice to
opt to receive any combination of services offered by franchisee. Except as
federal law otherwise provides, subscribers may not be required to pay any
charge, other than the regular service fee, including an upgrade or downgrade
charge, in order to receive the services selected.
      (2)   No charge may be made for any service or product that the
subscriber has not affirmatively indicated it wishes to receive. Payment of the
regular monthly bill does not in and of itself constitute such an affirmative
indication.
   (B)   (1)   If a franchisee plans to provide a premium channel without
charge to subscribers who do not subscribe to a premium channel, the franchisee
shall, not later than 30 days before the premium channel is provided without
charge, notify all subscribers in writing by any reasonable means at its sole
discretion of its plans including the time period involved, notify all
subscribers they have a right to request that the premium channel be blocked,
and block the premium channel upon the request of a subscriber.
      (2)   For the purpose of this division (B), the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.

§ 116.145 FINDING.
   (A)   The village finds that public rights-of-way of the village to be used
by a franchisee or any other person for the provision of cable service over a
cable system are valuable public property acquired and maintained by the
village at great expense to taxpayers.
   (B)   The village further finds that the grant of a franchise to use public
rights-of-way is a valuable property right without which a franchisee would be
required to invest substantial capital.

§ 116.146 PAYMENT TO VILLAGE.
   (A)   As compensation for use of a public rights-of-way, a franchisee and
any other person providing cable service over a cable system shall pay the
village franchise fees.
   (B)   Every franchise agreement shall specify the amounts a franchisee is
initially required to pay as a percentage of gross revenues, but if the
specified amount is less than the maximum or if the maximum amount permitted
increases, the village may increase it to any amount up to the maximum allowed
by law after 60 days notice to the franchisee, so long as the increase may by
law be passed on to subscribers.

payments that a franchisee or other person may be required to pay under any
federal, state or local law, including any applicable property and amusement

fee under 47 USC § 542.

§ 116.148 PAYMENTS.
   (A)   The franchise fees and any other costs or penalties assessed by the
village against a franchisee or any other person shall be paid quarterly to the
village and shall commence as of the effective date of a franchise. The village
shall be furnished at the time of each payment with a statement certified by
the franchisee’s or other person’s respective chief financial officer or an
independent certified public accountant reflecting the total amount of gross
revenues for the payment period. Payments shall be made to the village no later
than 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter.
   (B)   In the event any franchise fee or other payment is not made on or
before the date specified herein, the franchisee and any other person shall pay
interest charges computed from the due date, at an annual rate equal to the
commercial prime interest rate of the village’s primary depository bank during
the period the unpaid amount is owed, plus 2% of the amount due to defray the
village’s additional expenses by reason of the delinquency.

§ 116.149 NO ACCORD OR SATISFACTION.
   No acceptance of any payment by the village shall be construed as a release
or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the village may have for further or
additional sums payable as franchise fees under this code or for the
performance of any other obligation of a franchisee or other person.

§ 116.150 AUDIT.
   (A)   (1)   The village shall have the right to inspect all reasonably
necessary records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts
determined to be payable under this code. The franchisee shall be responsible
for providing the records to the village at an office located within the
county. The records shall be maintained for at least five years. The village’s
audit expenses shall be borne by the franchisee if the franchise fees paid
during the audit period are less than 98% of the amount owed according to the
audit.
      (2)   Any additional amounts due to the village as a result of the audit
shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the franchisee by the
village of the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the audit
report.

village, the amount shall be subject to interest, as specified in § 116.148(B).

§ 116.164 FAILURE CONSTITUTES MATERIAL VIOLATION.

§ 116.165 INDEMNIFICATION.
   (A)   A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold
harmless and defend the village, its officials, boards, board members,
commissions, commissioners, agents and employees, against any and all claims,
suits, causes of action, proceedings and judgments for damages or equitable
relief arising out of the construction, maintenance or operation of its cable
system; copyright infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure
consents from the owners, authorized distributors or licenses of programs to be
delivered by the cable system; the conduct of the franchisee’s business in the
village; or in any way arising out of the granting of a franchise or a
franchisee’s enjoyment or exercise of a franchise granted hereunder, regardless
of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this code or a franchise agreement.
   (B)   (1)   Specifically, but not by way of limitation on the scope of
division (A) above, a franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the village, and in their capacity as such,
the officers, agents and employees thereof, from and against any and all
claims, suits, actions, liability and judgments for damages or otherwise
subject to § 638 of the Cable Act, 47 USC § 558, arising out of or alleged to
arise out of the installation, construction, operation or maintenance of its
system, including, but not limited to any claim against the franchisee for
invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person or the violation or
infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark or patent
or of any other similar right of any person.
      (2)   This indemnify does not apply to programming carried on any channel
set aside for public, educational or government use or channels leased pursuant
to 47 USC § 532, unless the franchisee was, in any respect, engaged in

programming for the purported purpose of banning or regulating indecent or
obscene programming.
   (C)   The indemnity provision includes, but is not limited to the village’s
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit
or proceeding prior to franchisee assuming such defense. The village shall
notify a franchisee of claims and suits as soon as practicable, but failure to
give the notice shall not relieve a franchisee of its obligations hereunder.
Once a franchisee assumes the defense, the village may, at its option, continue
to participate in the defense at its own expense.
   (D)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this code, the
village shall not be so indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any amounts
attributable to the village’s own negligence, willful misconduct, intentional
or criminal acts, including in the performance of its obligations under this
code or a franchise agreement.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-105) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES AND REMEDIES
§ 116.175 SECURITY FUND.
   (A)   (1)   Prior to a franchise becoming effective and on each anniversary
date thereafter during the franchise term including the date of termination,
the franchisee shall post with the Village Clerk sufficient funds to service as
a cash security deposit to be used as a security fund to ensure the
franchisee’s faithful performance of and compliance with all provisions of this
code, the franchise agreement and other applicable law, compliance with all
orders, permits and directions of the village, and the payment by the franchise
of any claims, liens, fees or taxes due the village which arise by reason of
the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.
      (2)   The amount of the security fund on deposit shall be equal to 3% of
the franchisee’s projected annual gross revenues for the upcoming year, or in
the instance of the final deposit, 3% of the actual gross revenues for the
preceding year.
   (B)   (1)   In lieu of a cash security fund, a franchisee may file and
maintain with the Village Clerk an irrevocable letter of credit with a surety
acceptable to the village in the amount specified in the preceding paragraph to
serve the same purposes as set forth therein. The letter of credit shall remain
in effect for the full term of the franchise plus an additional six months
thereafter or longer if there is any outstanding obligation or default on the
part of the franchisee, as determined by the Village Board.
      (2)   The franchisee and its surety shall be jointly and severally liable
under the terms of the letter of credit for the franchisee’s failure to ensure
its faithful performance of and compliance with all provisions of this code,
the franchise agreement and other applicable law and compliance with all
orders, permits and directions of the village, and the payment by the
franchisee of any claims, liens, fees or taxes due the village which arise by
reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system. The letter
of credit shall provide for, 30 days’ prior written notice to the village, any
intention on the part of the franchisee to cancel, fail to renew or otherwise
materially alter its terms. Neither the filing of a letter of credit with the
village, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the village thereunder,
shall be construed to excuse unfaithful performance by the franchisee or limit
the liability of the franchisee under the terms of its franchise for damages,
either to the full amount of the letter of credit or otherwise.
   (C)   The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund
are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this
code or authorized by other law or a franchise agreement, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the security fund or letter
of credit will affect any other right the village may have.
   (D)   The following procedures shall apply to drawing on the security fund
and letter of credit.
      (1)   If the franchisee fails to make timely payment to the village of
any amount due as a result of a franchise, fails to make timely payment to the
village of any amounts due under a franchise agreement or applicable law, fails
to make timely payment to the village of any taxes due, or fails to compensate
the village within ten days of written notification that such compensation is
due for any damages, costs or expenses the village suffers or incurs by reason
of any act or omission of the franchisee in connection with its franchise
agreement or the enforcement of its franchise agreement, the village may
withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security
fund or from funds available under the letter of credit.
      (2)   Within three days of a withdrawal from the security fund or under
the letter of credit, the village shall mail, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, written notification of the amount, date and purpose of the
withdrawal to the franchisee.
      (3)   If at the time of a withdrawal from the security fund and under the
letter of credit by the village, the amounts available are insufficient to
provide the total payment towards which the withdrawal is directed, the balance
of the payment shall continue as the obligation of the franchisee to the
village until it is paid.
      (4)   No later than 30 days after mailing of notification to the
franchisee by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a withdrawal under
the security fund or letter of credit, the franchisee shall deliver to the
village for deposit in the security fund an amount equal to the amount so
withdrawn or shall restore the letter of credit. Failure to make timely
delivery of the amount to the village or to restore the letter of credit shall
constitute a material violation of the franchise.
      (5)   Upon termination of the franchise under conditions other than those
stipulating forfeiture of the security fund, the balance then remaining in the
security fund shall be withdrawn by the village and paid to the franchisee
within six months of the termination, provided that there is then no
outstanding obligation or default on the part of the franchisee.
      (6)   In addition to or in lieu of a security fund or letter of credit, a
franchise may require the guarantees as the village deems to be in the public
interest.

   (A)   (1)   Prior to any cable system construction, upgrade or other work in
the public rights-of-way, a franchisee shall establish in the village’s favor a
performance bond to ensure the franchisee’s faithful performance of the
construction, upgrade or other work.
      (2)   The amount of the performance bond shall be equal to 10% of the
total cost of the work unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement.
   (B)   (1)   In the event a franchisee subject to such a performance bond
fails to complete the cable system construction, upgrade or other work in the
public rights-of-way in a safe, timely and competent manner, after notice and a
reasonable opportunity to cure, there shall be recoverable, jointly and
severally from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss
suffered by the village as a result, including the full amount of any
compensation, indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property
of the franchisee, or the cost of completing or repairing the system
construction, upgrade or other work in the public rights-of-way, plus a
reasonable allowance for attorneys’ fees, up to the full amount of the bond.
      (2)   The village may also recover against the bond any amount
recoverable against a security fund where the amount exceeds that available
under a security fund.
   (C)   Upon completion of the system construction, upgrade or other such work
in the public rights-of- way and payment of all construction obligations of the
cable system to the satisfaction of the Village Board, the Village Board shall
eliminate the bond after a time appropriate to determine whether the work
performed was satisfactory, which time shall be established considering the
nature of the work performed.
   (D)   The performance bond shall be issued by a surety with a B+7 or better
rating of insurance in Best’s Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition,
shall be subject to the approval of the Village Attorney and shall contain the
following endorsement:
“This bond may not be canceled or allowed to lapse until 60 days after receipt
by the village, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew.”
(`92 Code, § 8-1-108) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.177 FAILURE CONSTITUTES MATERIAL VIOLATION.
   Failure to maintain a required security fund, letter of credit or
performance bond shall constitute a material violation of a franchise.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-109) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.178 REMEDIES.
   In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity, the village
may apply any one or a combination of the following remedies in the event a
franchisee violates this code, its franchise agreement, other applicable
ordinances or applicable state or federal law:
   (A)   Revoke the franchise or shorten the term pursuant to the procedures
specified in this code;
   (B)   Impose penalties available hereunder and other applicable state and
local laws for violation of village ordinances;

(`92 Code, § 8-1-110) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.179 SHORTENING, REVOCATION OR TERMINATING FRANCHISE.
   (A)   (1)   The village shall have the right to shorten the term of a
franchise to a term not less than 31 months from the date of the action
shortening the franchise term, or to revoke the franchise, for a franchisee’s
substantial and ongoing failure to construct, operate or maintain the cable
system as required by this code or a franchise agreement; for defrauding or
attempting to defraud the village or subscribers; if the franchisee is declared
bankrupt; or for any other substantial and ongoing material violation of this
code or substantial and ongoing material violation of a franchise agreement.
      (2)   To invoke the provisions of this division, the Village Board shall
give the franchisee written notice of intent. If, within 30 calendar days
following the written notice from the village to the franchisee, the franchisee
has not completed corrective action or corrective action is not being actively
and expeditiously pursued to the satisfaction of the Village Board, the Village
Board may give written notice to the franchisee of its decision to commence a
proceeding to consider shortening the term of or revoking the franchise,
stating its reasons; provided that no opportunity to cure shall be afforded in
the event the franchisee is declared bankrupt. Revocation for bankruptcy shall
be governed by division (C) below.
   (B)   (1)   Prior to shortening the term of or revoking a franchise, the
Village Board shall hold a public hearing, after giving at least 15 calendar
days’ notice by posting and publication, at which time the franchisee and the
public shall be given an opportunity to be heard.
      (2)   Following the public hearing, the Village Board may determine
whether to shorten the franchise term or to revoke the franchise based on the
information presented at the hearing and other information of record. If the
Village Board determines to shorten a franchise term or revoke a franchise, it
shall make the decision by ordinance setting forth the reasons for its
decision.
      (3)   The village may make the decision conditional on a franchisee’s
failure to resolve outstanding problems or take appropriate steps to resolve
the problems within a specific period of time.
      (4)   A copy of the decision shall be provided to the franchisee.
   (C)   Any franchise may, at the option of the Village Board following a
public hearing, be revoked by ordinance 120 calendar days after an assignment
for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to
take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors or other
action or proceeding unless within that 120-day period:
      (1)   The assignment, receivership or trusteeship have been vacated;
      (2)   The assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms
and conditions of this code and the existing franchise agreement and has
executed an agreement, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, assuming
and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this code and the
existing franchise agreement; and
      (3)   In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of a material
portion of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee (other than
pursuant to a pledge or mortgage which qualified as an exception to the
definition of a “franchise transfer” and after which the franchise transfer was
ultimately approved), the Village Board may revoke the franchise, following a
public hearing before the Village Board, by serving notice on the franchisee
and the successful bidder, in which even the franchise and all rights and
privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days
after serving the notice, unless:
         (a)   The Village Board has approved the franchise transfer; and
         (b)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the village
to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement
and this code.
   (D)   If the Village Board revokes a franchise, if a franchise expires, or
if for any other reason a franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate
or maintain service to its subscribers after notice and reasonable opportunity
to cure of at least 30 days, the following procedures and rights are effective:
      (1)   The Village Board may require the former franchisee to remove its
facilities and equipment at the former franchisee’s expense. If the former
franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the Village Board
may have the removal done at the former franchisee’s or surety’s expense. In
removing its plant, structures and equipment, the franchisee shall refill, at
its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all
public ways and places in as good condition as prevailed prior to the
franchisee’s removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the
electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments. The village shall inspect
and approve the condition of the public ways and public places; and cables,
wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity and
insurance as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the
period of removal and until full compliance by the franchisee with the terms
and conditions of this section and this code. In the event of a failure by the
franchisee to complete any such work or any other work required by village law
or ordinance within the time as may be established and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the village, the village may cause the work to be done and the
franchisee shall reimburse the village the reasonable cost thereof within 30
days after receipt of an itemized list of the costs.
      (2)   At the expiration of the term for which any franchise is granted,
if renewal is either not sought or denied, the village, at its election, shall
have the right to purchase and take over all or any part of a cable system
located within the village upon the payment to the franchisee of a sum equal to
the fair market value of the system or the part taken, based on system value as
a going concern. In the event of revocation, as provided for in this code, the
village at its election, shall have the right to purchase and take over all or
any part of a cable system located within the village upon payment to the
franchisee of a sum equal to an equitable price for the system or the part
taken. If the village elects to purchase only a part of the system, the fair
market value shall include both the fair market value of the part purchased
together with the diminution in value of the part not purchased. The price for
the cable system or the part taken, shall not include, and the franchisee shall
not receive, anything for the value allocated to the franchise itself unless
the valuation is now or subsequently provided for by the Cable Act or in the
franchise itself. Upon the exercise of the option by the village and its
service of an official notice of the action upon the franchisee, the franchisee
shall immediately transfer to the village possession and title to all of the
purchased facilities and property, real and personal, of the cable system, with
any existing liens and encumbrances, provided the village can require
application of purchase price to such liens and encumbrances at closing; and
the franchisee shall execute such warranty deeds or other instruments of
conveyance to the village as shall be reasonably necessary for this purpose.
Each contract entered into by franchisee with reference to its operations under
the franchise shall be subject to the exercise of this option by the village.
      (3)   If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee during the franchise
term, or if the franchisee fails to operate its system in accordance with this
code during any transition period, or the franchisee otherwise terminates the
franchise, upon decision of the Village Board made after providing the
franchisee reasonable notice of at least 30 days and an opportunity to be
heard, the ownership of all portions of the cable system in public rights-of-
way shall revert to the village and the village may sell, assign or transfer
all or part of the assets of the system, or the Village Board, at its option,
may operate the system, designate another entity to operate the system
temporarily until the franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable
to the village or until the franchise is revoked and a new franchisee selected
by the village is providing service, seek an injunction requiring the
franchisee to continue operations and/or seek to recover all damages sustained
as a result of the abandonment or failure to operate. A franchisee retains all
rights to contest such actions and all rights to compensation provided by law.
      (4)   A franchisee shall be deemed to have abandoned its system or failed
to operate its system during any transition period, if:
         (a)   The franchisee fails to provide cable service in accordance with
its franchise over a substantial portion of the cable system for 96 consecutive
hours unless the Village Board authorizes a longer interruption of service in
writing; or
         (b)   The franchisee, for any period, willfully and without cause
refuses to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a
substantial portion of the cable system.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, where the village
has issued a franchise requiring the completion of construction, system upgrade
or other specific obligation by a specified date, failure of the franchisee to
complete the construction or upgrade or to comply with such other specific
obligations as may be required, within such time limits, as same shall be
extended by the Village Board for good cause shown by the franchisee, will
result in the forfeiture of the franchise upon decision of the Village Board
made after providing the franchisee with reasonable notice of at least 30 days
and an opportunity to be heard.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-111) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)
§ 116.180 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.
   All remedies under this code and the franchise agreement are cumulative
unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not
foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of
penalties relieve a franchisee of its obligations to comply with its franchise.
Remedies may be used along or in combination as permitted by law; in addition,
the village may exercise any rights it has at law or equity.
(`92 Code, § 8-1-112) (Ord. 96-19, passed 10-2-96)

a security fund or letter of credit or otherwise does not limit a franchisee’s
duty to indemnify the village in any way; nor shall the recovery relieve a
franchisee of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the
village or in any respect prevent the village from exercising any other right
or remedy it may have.

situated persons or take any retaliatory action against a person because of

of providing service.
   (C)   A franchisee shall not deny access to cable service or levy different

its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber,
potential subscriber or group of subscribers or potential subscribers;

discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such
discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of
subscribers throughout the village; and a franchisee may offer reasonable
discounts for senior citizens or the economically disadvantaged, discounts or
customer specific pricing for bulk rate customers and other discounts as it is
expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if such discounts are applied
in a uniform and consistent manner.

state and local laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to
non-discrimination.

attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the village, the
wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of
the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      (2)   Application process. The village shall process applications as
follows:
         (a)   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by the different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         (b)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the village fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application.
            However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75
days after the submission of a completed application.
            The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 90th day
after the submission of the complete application or the tenth day after the
receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed
approved notice shall not preclude the village's denial of the permit request
within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (c)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the village fails to approve or

conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            The village shall document the basis for a denial, including the
specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
village denies an application.
            The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the village
and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial
is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The
village shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the
applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit the revised applications within 30 days of the denial shall require
the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the village's review period.
            The applicant must notify the village in writing of its intention
to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
            Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved
permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the

shall enter into License Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment Agreement.
      (3)   Completeness of application. Within 30 days after receiving an
application, the village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
30 days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in
the village's permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the
village.
         Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
village; or
         (b)   A local, state, or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the
collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless
facility and substantially the same type of structure.
         If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the
village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter.

safety agency's communications equipment.
      Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
      If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given notice of the interference by the public safety agency,
the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference
with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970
through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675.
      The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on
such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code
of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
   (D)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on
village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
      However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
      For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electrical Safety Code as
published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   (E)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local
code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
   (F)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that
are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth,
concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in the village
ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive plan or other
written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way,
including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
   (G)   Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility pole, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of
the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right
to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the
alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional
material costs as determined by the applicant.
      If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
   (H)   Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
      New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which
small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of;
      (1)   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other
than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on
the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structure
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
      (2)   45 feet above ground level.
   (I)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for
a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which
the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall
apply for a Special Use Permit or Variance in conformance with procedures,
terms and conditions set forth in §§
156.110 et seq.
   (J)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of- way.
   (K)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply
with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
   (L)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with
the local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility pole and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
   (M)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.

§ 122.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide regulations regarding the
cultivation, processing and dispensing of adult-use cannabis occurring within
the corporate limits of the village. Such facilities shall comply with all
regulations provided in the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (P.A. 101-0027)
(Act), as it may be amended from time-to-time, and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and the regulations provided below. In the event that the Act is
amended, the more restrictive of the state or local regulations shall apply.
The Building and Zoning Department shall govern the application process of a
Cannabis Business Establishment license.
   (B)   It is further the purpose of this chapter to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare of the residents, businesses, and property in the
village by prescribing the manner in which adult-use cannabis establishments to
operate, including matters in relation to:
      (1)   Providing for a means of cultivation, production, and distribution
of cannabis to persons permitted to obtain, possess, and use cannabis for
recreational purposes under the Act;
      (2)   Protecting public health and safety through reasonable limitations
on business operations as they relate to noise, air, and water quality, food
safety, neighborhood and public safety, security for the business and its
personnel, and other health and safety concerns;
      (3)   Promoting lively street life and high-quality neighborhoods by
limiting the concentration of any one type of adult-use cannabis establishments
in specific areas;
      (4)   Creating regulations that address the particular needs of the
residents and businesses of the village and coordinate with laws that may be
enacted by the State of Illinois regarding adult-use cannabis establishments
and recreational cannabis use;
      (5)   Facilitating the implementation of the Act without going beyond the
authority granted by it;
      (6)   Protecting public safety and residential areas by limiting the
areas of the village where adult-use cannabis establishments may be located;
      (7)   Permitting recreational cannabis use, distribution, cultivation,
and production where it will have a minimal impact and potential negative
impacts are minimized, since these can have an impact on health, safety, and
community resources;
      (8)   Use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and
transportation of cannabis is currently illegal under federal law, and cannabis
remains classified as a "Level 1 Controlled Substance" by federal law;
      (9)   The General Assembly has adopted enabling legislation that provides
for adult-use cannabis establishments; however, the Act does not completely
address the local impacts of adult-use cannabis establishments on
municipalities, making it appropriate for local regulation of adult-use
cannabis establishments;
      (10)   Nothing in this chapter is intended to promote or condone the
production, distribution, or possession of cannabis in violation of any
applicable laws;
      (11)   This chapter is to be construed to protect the public over the
interests of adult-use cannabis establishments;
      (12)   Adult-use cannabis establishments are a heavily regulated industry
in the state and all licensees are assumed to be fully aware of the law, hence
the village shall not therefore be required to issue warnings before issuing
citations for violations of this chapter;
      (13)   This chapter is intended to specify the time, place, and manner
restrictions for operating an adult-use cannabis establishment in the village
as specified under the Act and in this chapter; and
      (14)   The Village President and Board of Trustees have determined to
allow adult-use cannabis establishments in the village on the condition that
the establishments are operated in compliance with this chapter rather than
banning them in the village as permitted by the Act.

      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions, or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;

ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;

of the material, or absence thereof;

   (D)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement, or
possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

authorized to be used for the storage purposes, if within the corporate limits
of the village, or otherwise to remove it to a location outside the corporate
limits.
   (D)   Penalty for failure of owner to abate the nuisance. If the owners
allow the nuisance to exist or fail to abate the nuisance, they, and each of
them, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than $50, nor more than
$500, for each offense and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each
day during or on which the nuisance is permitted to exist.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to diminish threats to public health
and safety, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote
public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction,
use and maintenance of any new development or redevelopment or other activity
which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of
earth, and/or changes the stormwater drainage pattern and/or stormwater flows
from that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural
state. This stormwater runoff and resulting soil erosion could result in the
inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of
downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources.
This chapter regulates these activities to minimize adverse impacts.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives:
      (1)   To assure that new development or redevelopment does not increase
the drainage or flood hazards, or create unstable conditions susceptible to
soil erosion;
      (2)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff and soil erosion;
      (3)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased
flooding and soil erosion on a watershed basis;
      (4)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel
erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by stormwater
runoff and soil erosion quantities from new development or re- development;
      (5)   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land
and soil, water, air, animal, and plant resources;
      (6)   To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
watercourses and flood plains and to protect water quality and aquatic
habitats;
      (7)   To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in
order to manage flood and stormwater impacts, improve water and groundwater
quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, maintain
quality forest resources, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits, enhance community and economic development.
   (C)   The purpose of this chapter is also to comply with the General
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. ILR40
regulations, and the Notice of Intent (NOI) submitted to the IEPA in 2003.
(Ord. passed 12-9-02; Am. Ord. 2007-33, passed 6-20-07)

not urban and built up land or water areas. It is either used for food or fiber
or is available for those uses. The soil qualities, growing season and moisture
supply are those needed for a well managed soil to economically produce a
sustained high yield of crops. Prime farmland produces the highest yields with
minimum inputs of energy and economic resources, and farming it results in the
least damage to the environment.
   PROPERTY. A parcel of real estate.
   RETENTION BASIN. A facility designed to completely retain a specified amount
of stormwater runoff without release except by means of evaporation,
infiltration, emergency bypass or pumping.

within a tributary drainage basin which are in excess of the infiltration
capacity of the soils of that basin, which flow over the surface of the ground
or are collected in channels or conduits.

secondary to the use or maintenance of the land itself.
   WATERSHED. All land area drained by, or contributing water to, the same
stream, creek, ditch, lake, marsh, stormwater facility, groundwater or
depressional area.
   WET BASIN. A detention basin designed to maintain a permanent pool of water
after the temporary storage of stormwater runoff.
   WETLANDS. Wetlands are defined by regulation as “those areas that are
inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration
sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence
of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.” For
general, but not inclusive locations of designated wetlands refer to mapping
prepared jointly by the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service
and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Resource

less than or equal to 12 hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution
shall be used for the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance
system with critical durations greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24
hours. The fourth quartile distribution shall be used in the design and
analysis of systems with durations greater than 24 hours. The first, third, and
fourth quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in Table 37 of
Bulletin 70. Refer to Table 13 of Bulletin 70 for rainfall depth, duration, and
frequency. The NRCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the
Huff distributions. The total rainfall value for the design storm shall be
adjusted for the “St. Louis Urban Effect” as given in Table 4, Illinois State
Water Survey Circular 172.
   (F)   Antecedent moisture. Average antecedent moisture conditions shall be
assumed when calculating runoff curve numbers for use in the SCS TR-55 method.
   (G)   Wet detention basin design. Wet detention basins shall be designed to
remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as
much as feasible to be available for recreational use.
      (1)   Wet basin depths. Wet basins shall be at least three feet deep,
excluding near-shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided
they shall be at least eight feet deep over 25% of the bottom area to prevent
winterkill.
      (2)   Wet basin shoreline slopes. The side slopes of wet basins at the
normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than three to one (3 to 1 horizontal
to vertical). It is recommended that aquatic vegetation be established around
the perimeter to provide protection from shoreline erosion. For basins in
excess of five acres, rip rap shoreline protection shall be provided.
      (3)   Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall, at a minimum, be equal to the runoff volume from its
watershed for the two-year, 24-hour event (calculated during dry weather
conditions).
      (4)   Wet basin inlet and outlet orientation. The distance between
detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. Inlets and outlets shall be at
opposite ends of the basin providing that the orientation does not create undue
hardship based on topography or other natural constraints.
   (H)   (1)   Dry detention basin design. In addition to the other
requirements of this chapter, dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater
pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to
be available for multiple uses. Paved low flow channels may be used in a dry
basin provided provisions are made to prevent ponding.
      (2)   Dry basin drainage. Dry basins shall be designed so that the bottom
of the detention basin shall be 80% emptied of the standing water before or by
72 hours for any runoff event less than the 100- year, 24-hour event. Grading
plans shall clearly distinguish the wet portion of the basin bottom.
Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement.
      (3)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets
and to minimize resuspension of pollutants.
      (4)   Dry basin inlet and outlet orientation. Shall be the same as §
152.23(G)(4).
   (I)   Existing depressional areas. Existing depressional storage volume will
be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the
requirements of this chapter shall be in addition to existing storage.
   (J)   Minimum detention outlet size. Where a single pipe outlet or orifice
plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of
12 inches for larger basins. Smaller basins may install a smaller rectangular
or v-notch wier to control discharge. If this minimum orifice size permits
release rates greater than those specified in this section, and regional
detention is not a practical alternative, outlets, structures such as
perforated risers, or flow control orifices shall be used.
   (K)   (1)   Detention in flood plains. The placement of detention basins
within the flood plain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their
reliable operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention
requirements of this chapter may be fulfilled by providing detention storage
within flood fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions
are met as well as compliance with §
152.02.
      (2)   Detention in flood fringe areas. The placement of a detention basin
in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 1.5 times the
volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including
any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall still be
controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant
shall demonstrate its operation for all stream-flow and flood plain backwater
conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be
opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All flood plain storage
lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the
existing ten-year elevation. All flood plain storage lost above the existing
ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the existing ten-year flood
elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse and comply with §
152.02.
      (3)   Detention on prime farmland. The placement of detention basins
shall avoid the utilization of prime farmland. All detention basin construction
shall examine potential impacts to adjacent agricultural land and shall address
measures that will be implemented to eliminate such impacts and comply with §
152.02.
      (4)   Detention in floodways. Detention basins shall be placed in the
floodway only in accordance with §
152.23(K).
      (5)   On-stream detention. On-stream detention basins are discouraged but
allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other
provisions of this chapter with respect to water quality and control of the
100-year 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are presented in §
152.24. If on-stream detention is used in watersheds larger than one square
mile, the applicant will use hydrographic modeling to demonstrate that the
design will not increase the water level for any properties upstream or
downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-
stream detention:
         (a)   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
         (b)   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water
quality or stream aquatic habitat;
         (c)   Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin;
         (d)   Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of
wetlands;
         (e)   Shall require the implementation of an effective non-point
source management program throughout the upstream watershed which shall include
as a minimum: runoff reduction “Best Management Practices” (BMP’s) consistent
with §
152.21; two-year, 24-hour detention/sedimentation basins for all development
consistent with §
152.23(K)(5);
         (f)   Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge;
         (g)   Shall not contribute to the duration or flood frequency of any
adjacent land; and
         (h)   Shall comply with §
152.02.
   (L)   (1)   Drainage into wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, and
depressional storage areas. Wetlands, lakes, ponds and depressional storage
areas shall be protected from damaging modifications and adverse changes in
runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to
the other requirements of this chapter, the following requirements shall be met
for all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds
or depressional storage areas:
      (2)   Detention in wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds or
depressional storage areas. Existing wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds or
depressional storage areas shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater
detention unless it is demonstrated that the proposed modifications will
maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions and
shall comply with §
152.02. Existing storage and release rate characteristics of wetlands, rivers,
lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas shall be maintained and the volume
of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be
in addition to this existing storage.
      (3)   Sediment control. The existing wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds, or
depressional storage areas shall be protected during construction and as
further regulated in §§
152.35 et seq.
      (4)   Alteration of drainage patterns. Site drainage patterns shall not
be altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to
the wetlands, rivers, lakes, ponds or depressional storage areas.
      (5)   Detention/sedimentation. All runoff from the development shall be
routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture
the two-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being
discharged to the wetland, river, lake, pond, or depressional storage area.
This basin shall be constructed before property grading begins and shall be
maintained throughout the construction process. In addition, the drainage
hierarchy defined in §
152.20 should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged
to the wetland, river, stream, lake, pond, or depressional storage area and as
further regulated in this subchapter.
      (6)   Loessal soils. Care must be taken to avoid open flow discharges of
stormwater over silt (loessal) soils due to high potential for erosion.
      (7)   Sinkholes, Karst area. The following requirements apply for new
developments or redevelopments where sinkholes are determined to be present:
         (a)   A stormwater detention basin shall not be placed in or over a
sink-hole.
         (b)   Stormwater detention basins shall not be located closer than 100
feet from the rim of a sinkhole.
         (c)   The outflow from a stormwater detention basin, channel, ditch or
any stormwater runoff generated as a result of a new development or
redevelopment shall not empty into or be directed, redirected by any means into
or through any sinkhole.
         (d)   If, after the review of the stormwater drainage plan, the
Building and Zoning Administrator may determine that more detailed information
is required, a sinkhole evaluation may be required. A sinkhole evaluation which
addresses the geologic, engineering and environmental factors resulting from a
new development or redevelopment be performed by a professional with experience
and expertise in Karst topography, whom shall certify the results of the
evaluation. This evaluation shall be the responsibility of the applicant and
performed at no cost to the village. After a review of this evaluation and with
the consultation of the County Soil and Water Conservation District, the
village may either approve or disapprove the drainage plan as submitted.
         (e)   Whenever a new sinkhole appears or it becomes apparent that the
sinkhole has not yet been identified, it shall be reported to the County Soil
and Water Conservation District.
         (f)   Shall comply with §
152.02.
   (M)   Street detention, parking lot detention, and culvert drainage.
      (1)   Street detention. If streets are to be used as part of the minor or
major drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights and shall
not remain flooded for more than eight hours for any event less than or equal
to the 100-year, 24-hour event.
      (2)   Parking lot detention. The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any
parking area shall not exceed six inches for more than four hours.
      (3)   Culvert, road and driveway crossings. Sizing of culvert crossings
shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tailwater conditions on the
culvert.
   (N)   (1)   Infiltration practices. To effectively reduce runoff volumes,
infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement should
be located in hydrologic soil groups “A” and “B” as designated by the U.S.D.A.
Natural Resources Conservation Service. Infiltration basins and trenches
designed to re-charge groundwater shall not be located within 75 feet of a
water supply well or building foundation and comply with §
152.02. A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse sediment
from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Dry
basins shall be designed so that the bottom of the detention basin shall be 80%
emptied of the standing water before or by 72 hours for any runoff event less
than the 100-year, 24-hour event. The bottom of infiltration basins or trenches
shall be a minimum of four feet above the seasonally high groundwater and
bedrock level. Engineering calculations demonstrating infiltration rates shall
be included with the application.
      (2)   Vegetated filter strips and swales. To effectively filter
stormwater pollutants and promote infiltration of runoff, sites should be
designed to maximize the use of vegetated filter strips and swales. Whenever
practicable, runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed onto filter
strips and swales comprised of native grasses and forbs before being routed to
a storm sewer or detention basin.
   (O)   (1)   Safety considerations. The drainage system components,
especially all detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any
children or adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events and
shall comply with §
152.02.
      (2)   Side slopes. The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year,
24-hour capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls
into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of
detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than three to one
(horizontal to vertical).
      (3)   Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety
ledge at least four feet in width 2 to three feet below the normal water depth
or must be protected by an enclosed fence, at least 48 inches in height.
      (4)   Velocity. Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall
be controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of
flow.
      (5)   Overflow structures. See §
152.23(B).
   (P)   Maintenance considerations. The stormwater drainage system shall be
designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes shall be
designed to allow lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins
shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain
the pool for sediment removal. Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity
is not feasible. Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible,
for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Site access for heavy equipment
shall be provided.

§ 152.24 ACCOMMODATING FLOWS FROM UPSTREAM TRIBUTARY AREAS.
   (A)   Generally. Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property
shall be considered in the design of the property’s drainage system. Whenever
practicable, flows from upstream areas that are not to be detained should be
routed around the basin being provided for the site being developed.
   (B)   Upstream areas not meeting ordinance requirements. When there are
areas not meeting the storage and release rates of this chapter, tributary to
the applicant’s property, regionalized detention on the applicant’s property
shall may be explored by the applicant or the county. When it is deemed
beneficial by the county or the applicant to explore such a design, the
following steps shall be followed:
      (1)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his or
her property using the release rates of §
152.23, the applicant’s property area, and the procedures described in §
152.22.
      (2)   Areas tributary to the applicant’s property, not meeting the
storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, shall be identified.
      (3)   (a)   Using the areas determined above plus the applicant’s
property area, total storage needed for the combined properties shall be
computed.
         (b)   Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined
property areas. Storage shall be computed as described in §
152.23. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land
cover, based on local zoning, shall be used for the purposes of computing
storage.
         (c)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the village may
choose to pay for over-sizing the applicant’s detention basin to accommodate
the regional flows. The applicant’s responsibility will be limited to the
storage for his or her property as computed above. If regional storage is
selected by the village then the design produced in §
152.22 shall be implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the village,
the applicant shall bypass all tributary area flows around the applicant’s
basin whenever practicable. If the applicant roust route upstream flows through
his or her basin and the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size, the
applicant must meet the provision of §
152.23(K) for onstream basins.
   (C)   Upstream areas meeting ordinance requirements. When there are areas
which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, tributary
to the applicant’s property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around the
applicant’s detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative.
Storage needed for the applicant’s property shall be computed as described in §
152.23. However, if the village decides to route tributary area flows through
an applicant’s basin, the final design stormwater releases shall be based on
the combined total of the applicant’s property plus tributary areas.
(Ord. passed 12-9-02)
§ 152.25 EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES.
   Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as
part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the
first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in
these facilities shall be removed by the applicant on a regular basis and
before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of the
facilities.

SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
§ 152.35 FINDINGS.
   The village hereby finds that:
   (A)   The soil types found in the village are susceptible to erosion and if
left unprotected could cause severe loss of soil with resultant damage to
property;
   (B)   The topography of the village contains areas with steep slopes upon
which, if clearing of trees and/or inappropriate construction takes place,
could result in severe erosion and slope stability problems which could result
in damage to property;
   (C)   Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain non- agricultural uses including but not limited to the
construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the
building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and
drainage ways, and the creation of recreational facilities;
   (D)   The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision
and reducing traction of road vehicles;
   (E)   Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed out
fills, and embankments;
   (F)   Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to
pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, sinkholes, wetlands, and reservoirs;
   (G)   Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and
other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and
   (H)   Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage
capacity of flood plains and natural depressions, resulting in increased
chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
(Ord. passed 12-9-02)
§ 152.36 GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
   (A)   It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and
sedimentation caused by development activities, including clearing, grading,
stripping, excavating, and filling of land, in the village, including
individual lots. Measures taken to control soil erosion and off-site sediment
runoff shall be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the
site by a storm event of ten-year, 24-hour frequency or less. Water quality
shall adhere to:
      (1)   Illinois Environmental Protection Act - ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5, § 12,
from Ch. 111 1/2, par 1011 & 1012;
      (2)   Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules & Regulations - Title 35:
Environmental Protection, Subtitle C: Water Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution
Control Board, Part 302 Water Quality Standards; and
      (3)   Illinois Pollution Control Board Rules & Regulations - Title 35:
Environmental Protection, Subtitle C: Water Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution
Control Board, Part 304 Effluent Standards.
   (B)   The following principles shall apply to all new development or
redevelopment activities within the village and to the preparation of the
submissions required under §
152.37.
      (1)   New development or redevelopment shall be related to the topography
and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of
steep slopes greater than 33% where high cuts and fills may be required are to
be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as
closely as possible.
      (2)   Natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds,
sink holes, and wetlands are to be left undisturbed wherever possible.
Temporary crossings of watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate
stabilization measures.
      (3)   Special precautions shall be taken to prevent damages resultant
from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake,
pond, sinkhole or wetland. Preventive measures shall reflect the sensitivity of
these areas to erosion and sedimentation.
      (4)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the
shortest practical time during development.
      (5)   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any
other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures shall be installed prior
to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from run-off
waters from land undergoing development.
      (6)   The selection of erosion and sediment control measures shall be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs, and
benefits involved.
      (7)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices,
aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance must be considered.
      (8)   Provision shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused
by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant
velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on-site or
downstream.
      (9)   Permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed and
functional as soon as practical during development.
      (10)   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other
land uses shall be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
      (11)   All waste generated as a result of site development activity shall
be properly disposed of and shall be prevented from being carried off the site
by either wind or water.
      (12)   All construction sites shall provide measures to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
      (13)   All temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained to function as intended until the contributing drainage area has
been permanently stabilized at which time they shall be removed.

§ 152.38 DESIGN AND OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General. The preparation of soil erosion and sediment control plans
shall follow the principles outlined in the “Illinois Procedures and Standards
for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control”, excepting Chapter 6
published by the Urban Committee of the Association of Illinois Soil and Water
Conservation Districts. The design criteria, standards, and methods shall be
prepared in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and the standards
and specifications contained in “Illinois Urban Manual” prepared for the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency by the U.S.D.A. Natural Resources
Conservation Service, which standards and methods are hereby incorporated into
this chapter by reference. In the event of conflict between the provisions of
said manuals and of this chapter, this chapter shall govern.
   (B)   Erosion and sediment control design requirements. New developments or
redevelopments shall comply with §
152.37 and meet the following:
      (1)   Control measures shall be constructed to control runoff from the
property to such an extent possible that sediment is retained on-site.
      (2)   Temporary on-site control measures required shall be constructed
and functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or
fill activities on the site.
      (3)   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with permanent measures within
seven calendar days following the end of active disturbance, or re-disturbance
consistent with the following criteria:
         (a)   Appropriate permanent stabilization measures shall include
seeding, mulching, sodding, with non-vegetative measures as a last resort.
         (b)   Areas having slopes greater than 33% shall be stabilized with
sod, mat, or blanket in combination with seeding or equivalent.
      (4)   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices
must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of
their intended function.
      (5)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
disposed in a proper manner within 30 days after final site stabilization is
achieved with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
      (6)   Site development requirements: On-site sediment control measures,
as specified by the following criteria, shall be constructed as specified in
the referenced handbooks, and functional prior to initiating clearing, grading,
stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site.
         (a)   For new developments or redevelopments less than one acre, or
for a tract of land where a single-family dwelling is being erected and less
than 10,000 square feet of impervious surface is being developed, filter
barriers (including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures)
shall be constructed to control all on-site runoff. Vegetated filter strips,
with a minimum width of 25 feet, may be used as an alternative only where
runoff in sheet flow is expected.

§ 152.61 SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS.
   (A)   If at any stage of the grading of any development site the Zoning
Administrator determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that
further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any
property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the Zoning
Administrator may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that
such reasonable special precautions to be taken as is considered advisable to
avoid the likelihood of such peril. “Special precautions” may include, but
shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils
engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for
further work.
   (B)   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on
any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee
required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the Zoning Administrator
may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require
that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion
of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.

developer, however, shall be responsible for construction details and
construction quality of green space areas for a three-year period as provided
in §
154.088.
      (3)   As part of a developer’s site plan approval responsibility, the
developer shall be responsible for the improvements to the development for
passive use green space purposes including, but not limited to finished grading
and ground cover for all green spaces within the subdivision development.
      (4)   In a phased subdivision, the developer must provide the required
green space for the subdivision in proportional amounts for each phase of
development. The amount of green space exceeding the requirements in a
completed phase may be applied toward any future phase of the subdivision.
   (B)   The amount of green space required in a subdivision is as follows:
      (1)   Single-family residence district (SR-1): 10% of the total area of
the subdivision shall be green space.
      (2)   Single-family residence district (SR-2): 20% of the total area of
the subdivision shall be green space.
      (3)   Two- and three-family residence district (MR-1) and multi-family
residence district (MR-2): 20% of the total area of the subdivision shall be
green space.
   (C)   (1)   In addition to providing the required areas of green space
within the subdivision, the owner/developer shall pay to the village for
allocation to a park improvement fund the following sum:
         (a)   Single-family residence district (SR-1): $750 per lot.
         (b)   Single-family Residence district (SR-2): $500 per lot.
         (c)   Two- and three-family residence district (MR-1) and multi-family
residence district (MR-2): $750 per dwelling unit.
         (d)   Planned development residential (PDR): $750 per dwelling unit.
      (2)   The green space contribution shall be paid at the time the building
permit fees are paid and the building permit is obtained from the village.
   (D)   Green space shall be protected from development through platting, deed
restrictions or restrictive covenants which will ensure its perpetual use as a
green space, as defined herein, and which further provides that no changes in
use may be made without the express written consent of the Board of Trustees.

§ 154.033 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS IN RECREATIONAL ACCESS WAYS.
   (A)   Hard-surfaced sidewalks or access ways shall be required in all newly
developed subdivisions, commercial or industrial areas connecting such areas to
existing developed areas and/or to secondary streets which will allow
pedestrians, bicyclists or non-motorized vehicle travel between existing and
proposed developed areas.
   (B)   Where a new development abuts an existing park or bike trail, or a
proposed park or bike trail, a public right-of-way shall be planned and platted
on the preliminary and final plat to allow access on a hard-surfaced sidewalk
to the park or bike trail or a planned park or bike trail or park boundary. The
sidewalk shall be constructed at the cost of the developer and shall meet
village standards for the construction of sidewalks.
   (C)   Access ways shall be constructed of concrete or asphalt as determined
by the village. Where an access way meets a street, a curb cut shall be made to
allow ease of access by wheeled non-motorized vehicles. The village shall have
the right to require the subdivider or developer to construct ballards on the
access ways.
   (D)   Public rights-of-way for access ways shall be at least 20 feet wide
with a minimum pavement width of eight feet. Such public access rights-of-way
shall be dedicated to the village upon inspection and acceptance by the
village.
   (E)   Each platted subdivision, commercial or industrial development which
abuts an existing or proposed park or bike trail or park boundary shall provide
a minimum of one public right-of-way access way. The village may require more
than one such right-of-way upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission.
The layout and number of such public access ways shall be designed to provide
maximum access to the park or bike trail or park boundary via the internal
street or parking lot network of the development.
   (F)   The public right-of-way access way shall be designed to intersect as
nearly as possible at right angles to the connecting street. The grade of the
access way shall conform as closely as possible to the natural topography and
shall meet all state and federal standards for construction. The public access
right-of-way shall be sloped to allow for proper drainage and planted with
grass or other vegetation to stabilize the soil.

§ 154.051 ALLEYS.
   (A)   Alleys may be allowed in single-family residence districts only with
Planning Commission approval. Alleys may be required in multiple-family
districts and in commercial/industrial districts unless other adequate
provisions for service access are made. When required or provided, alleys shall
be at least ten feet wide, and shall be paved in accordance with §
154.057. Alleys normally shall not intersect with one another nor change
sharply in alignment.
   (B)   Adequate vehicular turnaround space shall be provided at the terminus
of any dead-end alley.
(`92 Code, § 34-3-5.6) (Am. Ord. 2024-32, passed 5-1-24)
§ 154.052 INTERSECTIONS.
   (A)   No more than two streets shall intersect at any one point.
   (B)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles; in no case shall two streets intersect at any angle of less than
75 degrees. An oblique street shall be curved approaching an intersection and
shall be approximately at right angles with the intersection for at least 100
feet therefrom.

   All streets and alleys shall be improved at the expense of the subdivider/
developer in accordance with requirements set forth herein.
   (A)   (1)   Whenever any subdivision/development abuts an existing street
that is narrower than the standards indicated in the Table of Street Design
Specifications, the subdivider/developer shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way
on the side abutting the subdivision/development to permit compliance with
those standards.
      (2)   The developer/subdivider shall improve the street to the standards
imposed at §
154.057 and pay one-half the cost of the improvements. Where it is not feasible
to construct the street at the time of the subdivision development, a non-
refundable deposit shall be made for the future street improvement.
   (B)   Whenever any subdivision/development includes an existing street,
incorporating both sides of the street, that is narrower than the standards
indicated in the Table of Street Design Specifications, the subdivider/
developer shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way on both sides of the street
within the subdivision/development to permit compliance with those standards.
The developer/subdivider shall improve the street to the standards imposed at §
154.057 and pay the entire cost of the improvements. Where it is not feasible
to construct the street at the time of the subdivision development, a non-
refundable deposit shall be made for the future street improvement.

§ 154.056 PRIVATE STREETS.
   (A)   Hereafter, it shall be unlawful to create any private street unless a
subdivision variance has been granted. To obtain a variance, the subdivider
must satisfactorily demonstrate that there is virtually no current or potential
public interest in the proposed private street.
   (B)   In every case, a variance to permit a private street shall be subject
to the following conditions:
      (1)   That no additional subdivision shall be developed using a private
street as a means of access to a public street;
      (2)   That the final plat will show the location and width of a private
street; and
      (3)   That the final plat will include a certificate stating essentially
as follows:
I/We,                                    , owner/owners of the land being
subdivided hereon and owner/owners of the private road/street shown hereon,
declare that the private road/street is not dedicated to the public but shall
remain private, to be maintained by and for the adjoining lot owners until such

PAVEMENT STRUCTURE
§ 154.070 GENERALLY.
   (A)   All streets and alleys shall be paved across the entire surface-width
as specified in Table 3-B located at the end of this chapter. The Village Board
reserves the right to select the most appropriate option; likewise, equivalents
to the following standards may be approved by the Village Board, depending on
engineering and traffic volume considerations. The village also reserves the
right to compel the developer to extract cores from the constructed roadway
pavements, and may assess penalties if the minimum pavement thicknesses are not
constructed as specified in the aforementioned Table 3-B according to the
following method. Determination of pavement thickness shall be performed after
the pavement surface tests and corrective action have been completed according
to the Illinois Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road
and Bridge Construction, current edition. The procedure to determine the in-
place pavement thickness and remedies shall be as follows.
      (1)   Length of units. The length of a unit will be a continuous strip of
pavement 150 feet in length.
      (2)   Width of units.
         (a)   Flexible pavements. The width of a unit will be the width from
the pavement edge to the adjacent lane line, from one lane line to the next, or
between pavement edges for single-lane pavements.
         (b)   Rigid pavements. The width of a unit shall be the width from the
pavement edge to the adjacent longitudinal joint, from one longitudinal joint
to the next, or between pavement edges where there is no longitudinal joint.
      (3)   Thickness measurements. Pavement thickness will be based on cores
two inches in diameter.
         (a)   Cores shall be taken from the pavement by the developer at
locations selected by the engineer. When determining the thickness of a unit,
one core shall be taken in each unit.
         (b)   The developer and the engineer shall witness the coring
operations, as well as the measuring and recording of the cores. Core
measurements will be determined immediately upon removal from the core bit and
prior to moving to the next core location. Upon concurrence of the length, the
core samples shall become the property of the village.
         (c)   Upon completion of coring, all water shall be removed from the
hole, and the hole shall then be filled with a rapid-hardening mortar or
concrete. The material shall be mixed in a separate container, placed in the
hole, consolidated by rodding, and struck-off flush with the adjacent pavement.
      (4)   Unit deficient in thickness. In considering any portion of the
pavement that is deficient, the entire limits of the unit will be used in
computing the deficiency or determining the remedial action required.
      (5)   Thickness equals or exceeds specified thickness.  When the
thickness of a unit equals or exceeds the specified plan thickness, it shall be
deemed as acceptable by the village.
      (6)   Thickness deficient by 10% or less. When the thickness of a unit is
less than the specified plan thickness by 10% or less, a financial penalty will
be assessed per square yard for the item involved. The value of the full
penalty will be determined from the average unit price of the installed
pavement type from the most currently published Illinois Department of
Transportation’s state letting results. A percentage of the full penalty will
be assessed as given in the following table:
 
Percent Deficiency (Of Plan Thickness) Percent of Full Penalty
                                       (Per Square Yard)
0.0 to 2.0                             0
2.1 to 3.0                             20
3.1 to 4.0                             28
4.1 to 5.0                             32
5.1 to 7.5                             43
7.6 to 10.0                            50
 
      (7)   Thickness deficient by more than 10%. When a core shows the
pavement to be deficient by more than 10% of plan thickness, additional cores
shall be taken on each side of the deficient core, at stations selected by the
developer and offsets selected by the engineer, to determine the limits of the
deficient pavement. No core shall be located within five feet of a previous
core obtained for thickness determination. The first acceptable core obtained
on each side of a deficient core will be used to determine the length of the
deficient pavement. An acceptable core is a core with a thickness of at least
90% of plan thickness. The area of deficient pavement will be defined using the
length between two acceptable cores and the full width of the unit. The area of
deficient pavement shall be removed and replaced; however, when requested in
writing by the developer, the engineer may permit in writing such areas of
deficient flexible pavement to remain in place. For deficient areas of flexible
pavement allowed to remain in place, additional lift(s) may be placed, at no
additional cost to the village, to bring the deficient pavement to plan
thickness, when the engineer determines grade control conditions will permit
such lift(s). The area(s) to be overlaid, the material to be used, the
thickness(es) of the lift(s), and the method of placement will be approved by
the engineer. The option of correcting deficient rigid pavement with additional
lift(s) shall not apply.
      (8)   When an area of deficient pavement is removed and replaced, or
additional lifts are placed, the corrected pavement shall be retested for
thickness.
      (9)   The thickness of the first acceptable core on each side of the core
more than 10% deficient will be used to determine any needed penalty
assessments for the remaining areas on each side of the area deficient by more
than 10%.
      (10)   Right of discovery.  
         (a)   When the engineer has reason to believe any core location does
not accurately represent the true conditions of the work, he or she may order
additional cores. These additional cores shall be taken at specific locations
determined by the engineer. The engineer will provide notice to the developer
containing an explanation of the reasons for his or her action.
         (b)   When the additional cores show the pavement to be deficient by
more than 10% of plan thickness, the procedures outlined in division (A)(7)
shall be followed, except the engineer will determine the additional core
locations.
      (11)   Profile index adjustment. After any area of pavement is removed
and replaced, or any additional lifts are added, the corrected areas shall be
retested for pavement smoothness. Any necessary profile index adjustments and/
or corrections will be made based on these final profile readings prior to
retesting for thickness.
   (B)   All material types for construction are to be furnished and installed
as specified in the latest edition of the Illinois Department of Transportation
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.
   (C)   All new or replacement driveways constructed for new and/or existing
residences shall have a two inch expansion joint installed where the driveway
abuts the back of curb/gutter and where the driveway abuts the garage slab as
shown on the detail sheet attached to the ordinance codified herein and
available from the village. These expansion joints shall be maintained by the
property owner.
   (D)   All concrete street pavement shall be required to have expansion
joints at locations noted as A2 on the detail sheet for PCC Pavement Special
(Non-reinforced) Detail attached to the ordinance codified herein and available
from the village.

§ 154.071 EARTH SUBBASE.
   (A)   All fill areas within proposed street rights-of-way shall be placed in
eight-inch lifts and compacted to 95% standard proctor on a lime modified sub-
grade 12 inches in depth as noted in Table 3-B located at the end of this
chapter. The developer or contractor will be responsible to have compaction
tests performed by qualified personnel and submit copies of these tests to the
village. The number of tests will be determined by the Village Engineer.
   (B)   Portland cement concrete pavement joints shall be sawed longitudinally
in center and every 15 feet transversely.
   (C)   Materials and construction techniques shall be in accordance with the
applicable sections of the latest edition of the Standards and Specification
for Road and Bridge Construction, as published by the Illinois Department of
Transportation.
   (D)   In the event of dispute, Illinois Department of Transportation
standards and specifications shall prevail.
   (E)   An Illinois registered professional engineer shall be required to
certify any pavement design reports, compaction reports and the like that are
required.
   (F)   (1)   Trench drains a minimum of 12 inches wide and 30 inches deep
with a four inch perforated pipe placed in rock backfill to within six inch of
the ground surface and covered with geotextile fabric shall be installed on
both sides of the street or roadway as required in the notes on Table 3-
B located at the end of this section.
      (2)   Trench drains on all new village streets and roadways with profile
grades greater than 5%.
         (a)   Minimum 12 inch wide and 30 inch deep;

§ 154.116 SUBDIVISION VARIANCES.
   (A)   Any subdivider/developer desiring a variance from the requirements of
this code shall file a written application therefore with the Planning
Commission and Administrator at the same time that he files his or her
preliminary plat. The application shall fully explain the grounds for the

applied, would cause great practical difficulties or hardship. The
Administrator shall prepare a written advisory report on every variance
application and submit it, together with the completed application, to the Plan
Commission.
(`92 Code, § 34-6-2)
   (B)   (1)   The Planning Commission shall review the variance application
and the Administrator’s comments, perform on-site review when appropriate and
submit their advisory report to the Board of Trustees together with their
recommendation on preliminary plat approval. The Planning Commission’s advisory

(C) below.
      (2)   A copy of the Committee’s decision, clearly stating their reasons
therefore and exact terms of any variance granted, shall be attached to the

(`92 Code, § 34-6-2.1)
   (C)   At the same meeting at which they take action on the application for
preliminary plat approval, the Board of Trustees shall decide by resolution
whether to grant or deny the requested subdivision/development variance. A copy
of their decision, clearly stating their reasons therefore and the exact terms
of any variance granted, shall be attached to both the preliminary and final
plats. The Board of Trustees shall not grant any subdivision/development
variance unless, based upon the information presented to them, they determine
that:
      (1)   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of
this code;
      (2)   Strict application of the subdivision/development requirements
would result in great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant;
      (3)   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from the
subdivision/development requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/
hardship;
      (4)   The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
his or her own making;
      (5)   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other tracts and, therefore, that a variance would be a more
appropriate remedy than a code amendment; and
      (6)   The variance, if granted, will not materially frustrate
implementation of the municipal comprehensive plan including the official map.

amending, modifying or superseding any subdivision or neighborhood restrictive
covenants regulating the parking, storing, allowance or disallowance of
recreational vehicles, motorhomes, boats, camping trailers, horse trailers or
any other trailer of any type. The village recognizes that many subdivisions
and neighborhoods may have covenants, restrictions or regulations that prohibit
or more strictly regulate the parking and storage of recreational vehicles or
trailers and the village has no intent or desire to interfere with those
restrictions, regulations or prohibitions.

landscape improvements to be incorporated into development, thus becoming by
itself a valuable capital asset.
      (4)   Human values. Provide direct and important physical and
psychological benefits to human beings through the use of landscape materials
to reduce noise and glare, to provide visual diversity and seasonal interest,
and visually soften the harsher aspects of urban development.

all zoning districts shall be of the species, cultivars, or varieties listed in
the tables below (except where specific exceptions are noted in a table). The
species, cultivar, and/or variety which are listed in Table 4 are not
acceptable for planting within the public rights-of-way due to a variety of
factors such as susceptibility to salt damage, potential for providing a
traffic visual hazard, susceptibility to disease, potential for growth into
right-of-way, etc.

      (c)   Undesirable tree species, cultivars, or varieties. In order to
protect the village’s existing trees from disease, to ensure that the species
and varieties of trees which are planted will grow and be healthy, will be
resistant to storms, and do not provide other undesirable effects, the trees
listed below in Table 5 shall not be planted on existing sites and in
conjunction with new developments within the MR-1, MR-2, B-1, and B-2 districts
and within public rights-of-way within all zoning districts, except upon the
approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission in special locations where
because of characteristics of adaptability or landscape effect they can be used
to public advantage and will not create a detriment to adjoining property or
the trees thereon.

      (2)   Standards for landscape materials.
         (a)   Tree planting standards. Immediately upon planting all trees
shall conform to the American Association of Nurserymen Standards and have the
following characteristics:
            1.   In all MR-1, MR-2, B-1 and B-2 districts, all medium to large
canopy trees shall be a minimum of 12 feet in height and shall have a minimum
caliper of three inches.
            2.   All understory trees shall be at least five feet in height,
except where they are fulfilling the requirement as a landscape buffer as
provided for in this subchapter in which case they shall be a minimum of eight
feet in height. Deciduous small trees shall have a minimum caliper of two
inches, a minimum height of ten feet, and have not less than eight branches on
the upper half of the trunk.
            3.   Tree species mix: When more than ten trees are to be planted
to meet the requirements of this subchapter, a mix of species shall be
provided. The number of species to be planted shall vary according to the
overall number of trees required to be planted. Species shall be planted in
proportion to the mix.
            4.   On a corner lot in any district, development shall conform to
the requirements of a sight distance triangle in which nothing shall be
erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially
impede vision between a height of two feet and ten feet above the rides at the
back of the curb of the intersecting streets, within the triangular area formed
by the right-of-way lines and a line connecting them at points 40 feet from
their point of intersection or at equivalent points on private streets, except
that the site distance triangle may be increased when deemed necessary for
traffic safety the Building and Zoning Administrator.
            5.   Only medium deciduous trees shall be acceptable for planting
in public rights-of- way in all zoning districts where the planting area
between the curb or edge of the roadway pavement and the edge of the sidewalk
is limited to a width of between four and five feet. In all zoning districts
where the planting area between the curb or edge of the roadway pavement and
the edge of the sidewalk is greater than five feet, both medium and large
deciduous trees shall be acceptable for planting. In instances where deciduous
trees of either medium or large size are likely to cause interference with
overhead utility wires, understory deciduous trees will be acceptable for
planting.
            6.   Except as otherwise provided for herein, a five foot buffer
consisting of landscape plantings shall be required in side yards in all zoning
districts.
            7.   No tree shall be planted closer than 40 feet of any street
corner, measured from the point of nearest intersecting curbs or curb-lines or
within ten feet of any fire hydrant.
         (b)   Plant material installation standards. The following standards
shall apply to all landscape installation projects subject to regulation by
this Article and this chapter:
            1.   Soil utilized for the growing medium of plant materials shall
be friable, well- drained, local soil, capable of sustaining plant life. Areas
which have been compacted by construction activities shall be thoroughly
cultivated to the full depth of the compaction. Soil utilized for planting
within these areas may be existing soil, provided it is friable, well-drained,
free of construction debris including, but not limited to, scrap wood, trash,
chemical/oil spills, excess paving materials, crushed rock, sand, natural site
stones greater than one-inch mortar, and all other non-soil materials.
            2.   Organic mulches shall be used to reduce the growth of weeds,
add nutrients to the soil, and retain moisture over the root zones of plant
materials. When appropriate, a minimum of three inches of organic mulch shall
be placed beneath all newly installed tree, shrub, and ground cover planting
areas. At no time shall rock of any size or variety be placed around any
existing or newly planted tree located in a public right-of-way.
            3.   The top four inches of the lawn bed for all areas to be seeded
or sodded shall be topsoil. Topsoil shall be brought on-site from a local
commercial source.
         (c)   The following standards shall apply to all B-1 and B-
2 districts:
            1.   Any part of a lot area not used for buildings or other
structures or for parking, loading, or access ways, shall be landscaped with
grass, ground cover, trees, shrubs, and pedestrian walks in accordance with the
following provisions:
            2.   A planting strip of ten feet (not including sidewalks) shall
be provided and maintained within the required 30 foot front yard and shall
separate vehicular parking and drive areas from any public or private street or
right-of-way.
            3.   For all off-street parking areas the following standards shall
apply:
               a.   There shall be one three-inch caliper canopy tree existing
or planted for every ten parking spaces located within planting islands meeting
the standards prescribed herein. Each planting island area shall be a minimum
of 90 square feet in area and shall contain at least one deciduous canopy tree
of a type and size and type required herein. There shall be a minimum of two
trees, within and up to, every 100 linear feet of parking for each parking row.
Such trees shall be spaced evenly wherever possible and the ends of parking
rows abutting a circulation aisle shall be defined by a planting island
wherever feasible. These canopy trees and any associated planting islands areas
shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by non-mountable, reinforced
concrete curbing of a type specified by the Building and Zoning Administrator.
The use of unreinforced extruded curbing of asphalt or other materials shall be
prohibited.
               b.   In addition to any landscaped front, back or side yard
areas or planting islands required by this subchapter, for any parking area
containing more than five spaces, a minimum of 20 square feet of interior
landscaped area shall a provided within the parking lot for each parking space.
Landscape areas shall be uniformly distributed in one or more areas so as to
minimize and reduce the apparent size of parking areas.
               c.   Planting islands that are parallel to parking spaces should
be a minimum of nine feet wide.
               d.   Where planting islands are perpendicular to parking spaces,
islands should be a minimum of eight feet wide to allow for overhang of parked
cars. If parking is only on one side of the island, an eight foot width is
still required.
               e.   In instances where vehicle parking occurs perpendicular or
parallel to parking islands, no landscape plantings other than grass shall be
installed within 42 inches of the back of the curb.
               f.   Seventy-five percent of the canopy trees required in §
156.092(F) shall be located within the paved area, and the remaining canopy
trees shall be located in the front yards but in any event the number of trees
to be provided in the required front yard shall not be less the equivalent of
one tree for every 50 feet of frontage along any public or private street. In
complying with the front yard requirement and in order to maintain views into
the site, the required number of canopy trees may be clustered at site corners,
entry islands or other appropriate locations along the frontage. The canopy
trees of the variety specified in §
156.092(F) shall be counted in determining compliance with this provision.
               g.   No landscape hedge, bushes, shrubs, or other low-growing
plant material, wall, or berm shall exceed three feet in height within ten feet
of any driveway opening.
         (d)   Screening of mechanical equipment, trash, and loading area is
required. All mechanical equipment, trash receptacles, storage of materials and
equipment shall be within a fully enclosed building or in a side or rear yard
to screened by berms, dense vegetative plantings, wooden fences, or brick
walls, or combinations of these materials at least eight feet in height so that
said materials and equipment are not visible at the grade of the nearest
adjacent street and/or adjoining property lines. Roof-mounted mechanical
equipment shall also be screened so that it is not visible from the street or
on-site parking areas or adjacent residential properties. Materials used to
screen such roof-mounted mechanical equipment shall be of a type which is
complimentary to the building architecture.
         (e)   Where any parcel abuts any residential district or development,
a 50 foot perimeter landscape buffer shall be provided and maintained along all
rear and side property lines where it abuts the residential district or
development. The buffer area shall contain evergreen plant material with a
minimum height of eight feet, planted in such a manner to achieve an effective
spacing of six foot on center. The berm shall not exceed a slope of 30 degrees
and shall be completely covered with shrubs, grass, or other living ground
cover in addition to the evergreen plant material specified herein.
         (f)   All disturbed soil on the site that is not to be covered by
buildings, parking and loading areas, and driveways, and which is not subject
to other landscape treatment in accord with an approved site plan, shall be
graded in accord with said site plan and covered with sod.
      (3)   In the B-1 and B-2 districts, in order to present a healthy and
visually appealing appearance, landscaped areas shall be provided with adequate
irrigation for the maintenance of grass, shrubs, ground cover and other plant
materials by utilizing a sprinkler system, hose bibs, and/or such other method
of providing water.
      (4)   The following standards shall apply to all MR-1, MR-2 and PD-
R districts:
         (a)   In circumstances where existing parcels meeting the standard
prescribed in §
156.092(F) become nonconforming as a result of the loss of a canopy tree due to
storm damage, disease, or other means, the nonconforming condition shall be
corrected as soon as weather and planting conditions permit. In such instances
where public right-of-way is involved, the village shall be responsible for
correcting the non-conforming condition (except in instances where the property
owner has caused or condoned the damage). In such instances where private
right-of-way is involved, the property owner shall be responsible for
correcting the non-conforming condition. Any tree which replaces an existing
tree shall be selected and installed in accordance with the standards provided
for in this subchapter.
         (b)   On parcels where no sidewalk exists, the required canopy trees
shall be planted in an area not more than four feet nor less than three feet
from the back of the curb or street edge. However, in no event shall a tree be
planted where the clear space between the curb and the sidewalk is less than
four feet, except where special permission is obtained from the Building and
Zoning Administrator or his or her designated representative.
         (c)   On private property, no tree of any type shall be planted within
five feet of the right-of- way of any public street.
   (G)   Maintenance standards for trees and cultivated landscape areas. The
following standards shall apply in the maintenance of cultivated landscape
areas as defined in this Article which are located within B-1 and B-2 districts
and in public rights-of-way in all zoning districts unless otherwise
specifically stated:
      (1)   General. The owner or assigns of land shall be responsible for the
maintenance of the areas of said land subject to this Article in good condition
so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly landscape area and healthy trees.
      (2)   All required plants shall be maintained in a healthy, pest-free
condition. Within six months of a determination by the Building and Zoning
Administrator or his or her designated representative that a plant is dead or
severely damaged or diseased, the plant shall be replaced by the property owner
or owners in accordance with the standards specified in this.
      (3)   Removal of trees representing hazards or obstructions. It shall be
the responsibility of each property owner to remove any trees or shrubs, or
parts thereof, which overhang or interfere with traffic- control devices,
street lighting, public sidewalks, rights-of way, or property owned by the
village. The Building and Zoning Administrator or his or her designated
representative shall have the authority to order the pruning or removal of any,
such trees subject to the provisions herein or other applicable sections of the
Municipal Code of the village.
      (4)   Removal of trees; general. Any trees removed from properties
covered under the provisions of this subchapter or any other village ordinance,
and which will render the property non conforming with the provisions of this
subchapter, shall be replaced with trees which are of acceptable type and
species and in locations which comply with the provisions of this subchapter
and any previously approved site and landscape plan. Where such replacement
involves properties within a B-1, B-2, MR-1 or MR-2 district, a landscape plan
shall be required, shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of this
Article, and shall depict the trees to be removed and the type, species, and
location of replacement trees. Said landscape plan shall be prepared by a
professional landscape architect approved by the village.
      (5)   Pruning. All pruning should be accomplished according to standard
horticultural practices. Trees shall be pruned only as necessary to promote
health growth. Unless special approval is provided by the Building and Zoning
Administrator or his or her designated representative, trees shall be allowed
to attain their normal size and shall not be severely pruned or “topped” in
order to permanently maintain growth at a reduced height. It shall be unlawful
as a normal practice for any person, firm, or village department to top any
street tree, park tree, other tree on public property. Trees may be
periodically pruned or thinned in order to reduce the leaf mass and thus
minimize damage from storms. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes,
or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning
practices are impractical may be exempted from this Article at the
determination of the Building and Zoning Administrator or his or her designated
representative. All pruning shall be accomplished in accordance with the
National Arborists Standards.
      (6)   Stumps. The stumps of all removed trees shall be ground out to at
least three inches below the ground level, the chips removed, the soil cavity
filled with soil, and the area leveled. If the area where the tree is removed
is to be paved, the top of the stump shall be ground out to at least six inches
below the ground level.
      (7)   Mowing. Grass shall be mowed as required in order to encourage deep
root growth and therefore the preservation of irrigation water.
      (8)   Height maintenance. In order to assure the safe and unimpeded
progress of fire and street equipment of the village in the performance of its
designated functions, all trees, plants and shrubs that are within or adjacent
to and overhanging any public street, highway, road or thoroughfare shall be
maintained at a minimum height of 12 feet at the center line of the street,
highway, road or thoroughfare and ten feet at the curb of said public way when
said tree, plant, or shrub is fully leafed. The Building and Zoning
Administrator or his or her designated representative may require the property
owner to shape said plant growth as specified above or may cause same to be
maintained by members of the Department of Public Works.
      (9)   The Building and Zoning Administrator or his or her designated
representative may remove or cause or order to be removed, any tree or part
thereof on private property which is in an unsafe condition or which by reason
of its nature is injurious to sewers, electric power lines, gas lines, water
lines or other public improvements, or is afflicted with any injurious fungus,
insect or other pest.
      (10)   Removal. The village shall have the right to cause the removal of
any dead or diseased trees on private property with the village, when such
trees constitute a hazard to life and property, or harbor insects or disease
which constitute a potential threat to other trees within the village.
   (H)   Procedures upon order to prune or remove. In conjunctions with the
provisions of §
156.092(H) above the following procedures shall be used:
      (1)   When the Building and Zoning Administrator or his or her designated
representative shall find it necessary to order the pruning or removal of trees
or plants infected with disease or infested with damaging or disease-carrying
insects upon private property as provided for herein, he or she shall serve a
written order upon the property owner to correct the condition creating danger
or hazard to the public or to village vehicles or equipment.
      (2)   The order required herein shall be served by at least one of the
following methods:
         (a)   By personal delivery of the order to the property owner of
record.
         (b)   By mailing a copy of the order to the address of the owner of
the property based on the most recent address on file in the office of the
Madison County Assessor.
         (c)   If the property owner cannot be located for service by the means
specified in subsections (1) and (2) above, then a copy of the order shall be
published twice not less than 15 days between publications, in a local
newspaper of general circulation.
         (3)   The order required herein shall set forth a time limit not
earlier than seven days from the date of the order for compliance. In cases of
extreme danger to persons or public property, the Building and Zoning
Administrator or his or her designated representative, upon finding a hazardous
condition, shall have the authority to require forthwith compliance immediately
upon service of the order.
         (4)   The property owner to whom an order thereunder is directed shall
have the right within seven days of the service of the order, to appeal to the
Board of Trustees. Said appeal shall be filed with the Village Clerk with a
copy provided to the Building and Zoning Administrator. The Board of Trustees
shall review such order and the property owners’ reason for appeal not later
than their next regularly scheduled meeting so long as said meeting is not
sooner than seven days following receipt of the appeal by the Village Clerk.
Unless the order is revoked or modified it shall remain in full force and be
obeyed by the property owner to whom directed. No property owner to whom an
order is directed shall fail to comply with such order within ten days after an
appeal shall have been determined and a copy thereof served on the responsible
person or party. Any persons or parties jointly or severally aggrieved by any
decision of the Board of Trustees under this section may seek a review of such
decision by the Circuit Court of Madison County.
         (5)   When a property owner to whom an order is directed shall fail to
comply within the specified period of time, the Building and Zoning
Administrator or his or her designated representative shall remedy the
condition or contract with others for such purpose and charge the cost thereof
to the person or party.
         (6)   When in the opinion of the Building and Zoning Administrator or
his or her designated representative there is an actual and imminent danger
from a damaged or diseased tree which would endanger life; or when any tree, or
any part thereof, has fallen and life is endangered, the Building and Zoning
Administrator or his or her designated representative is authorized and
empowered to take whatever action as may be necessary to render the tree or
part thereof temporarily safe, whether or not the notice procedure as
previously described in this section has been instituted.
         (7)   The costs incurred in the performance of any procedure required
as a result of conditions as outlined in divisions (F) and (G) above shall be
billed to the owner of the real property where such work is performed. If such
bill is not paid within 30 days after forwarding a statement therefore by the
Building and Zoning Administrator or his or her authorized representative, the
costs shall be levied against the property upon which such work was performed
as a special assessment. The levying of the assessment herein shall not affect
the liability of the persons or parties where such work was performed. Such
special assessment shall be certified by the Building and Zoning Administrator
to the Village Clerk and shall thereupon become and be a lien upon the property
and shall be included in the next tax bill rendered to the owner thereof unless
paid before, and shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes against
the property.
   (I)   Interference. It shall be unlawful to delay or in any manner interfere
with the Building and Zoning Administrator or his or her designated
representative in planting, pruning, spraying or removing any tree, shrub,
vine, or flowering plant in any public street, boulevard, alley, park, or other
public place, or in the removal of any stone, cement or other material from
about the trunk thereof; to interfere with or delay the Building and Zoning
Administrator or his or her designated representative in the removal of
dangerous or diseased trees on private property as provided for herein in §

his or her designated representatives in the discharged of duties provided for
in this Article.
   (J)   Penalties. Any person who violates any provision of this Article of
this chapter or who fails to comply with any notice issued pursuant to the
provision of the ordinance, upon being found guilty of violation, shall be
subject to a fine not to exceed $500 for each separate offense. Each day during
which any violation of the provisions of this Article shall occur or continue
shall be a separate offense. If, as the result of the violation of any
provision of this Article, the injury, mutilation, or death of a tree, shrub,
or other plant located on village-owned property is caused, the cost of repair
or replacement of such tree, shrub, or other plant shall be borne by the
persons or parties in violation. The replacement value of trees and shrubs
shall be determined in accordance with the latest revision of A Guide to the
Professional Evaluation of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs, and Evergreens, as
published by the International Society of Arboriculture.
   (K)   Landscape plan required. In conjunction with the requirements of other
provisions of this Article and this chapter with respect to site plan review
and prior to the issuance of any building permit, a landscape plan shall be
submitted to, reviewed by, and approved by the Planning Commission. A landscape
plan for each lot or parcel involved in the proposed development shall be

      (6)   Site lighting shall not create glare which is directed toward or
reflected onto streets, or interior drives where such glare could negatively
impact vehicular or pedestrian safety.
      (7)   Except as may be provided elsewhere in this section, site lighting
shall at no time be directed upward, in a radiating and/or moving or sweeping
pattern, or at any angle which will light surfaces other than building walls,
panting or pedestrian areas, and landscaped areas, and shall not create
lighting patterns which will direct light toward residential areas.
      (8)   At the time of filing any application for any use, development,
amendment or change as set out in division (A) above, a lighting plan for site
lighting shall be provided on a separate sheet. The following information shall
be submitted as part of the lighting plan:

(`92 Code, § 40-5-5)
§ 156.115 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS; INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of the Planned Development Districts is to provide a means
of achieving greater flexibility in development of land in a manner not always
possible in conventional zoning districts; to encourage a more imaginative and
innovative design of land development; and to promote a more desirable
community environment. The Board of Trustees, upon recommendation by the Plan
Commission, may, by an ordinance adopted in the same manner as a rezoning is
approved, authorize a Planned Development district when the proposed
development or use of a specific tract of land or area warrants greater
flexibility, control and density than is afforded under the general regulations
of standard zoning districts. These Planned Development regulations are not
intended to allow excessive densities, or the development of incompatible land
uses, either within the development, or as the development relates to the
general neighborhood. The Board of Trustees may, upon proper application,
approve a Planned Development to facilitate the use of flexible techniques of
land development and site design, by providing relief from conventional zoning
standards in order to achieve one or more of the following objectives:
      (1)   Site planning that better adapts to site conditions and its
relation to surrounding properties that would not otherwise be possible or
would be inhibited under the district regulations applicable to the property.
      (2)   Functional and beneficial uses of open space areas.
      (3)   Preservation of natural features of a development site.
      (4)   Creation of a safe and desirable living environment for residential
areas characterized by a unified building and site development program.
      (5)   Rational and economical in relation to public utilities and
services.
      (6)   Efficient and effective traffic circulation, both within and
adjacent to the development site.
   (B)   Relationship of planned development districts to zoning map.
      (1)   A mapped district. The PD designation is not intended to be
attached to existing zoning districts as an overlay. The PD designation, as
detailed in this section, is a separate use district and may be attached to a
parcel of land through the process of rezoning and zoning map amendment.
      (2)   Plan approval required. It is the intent of this Article that no
development or redevelopment of the property encompassed by the PD designation
take place until an acceptable development plan has been reviewed and approved
in conformance with the requirements of this section, §§
156.170 through
156.175, Amendments, and applicable subdivision regulations of Municipal Code.
   (C)   Coordination with §§
156.170 through
156.175, Amendments and Applicable Subdivision Regulations of the Municipal
Code.
      (1)   When a planned development involves any subdivision activity, the
subdivision review and approval procedure requirements contained in the
Subdivision Regulations of the Municipal Code shall be carried out
simultaneously with the review of a Planned Development under this section of
this Article. As applicable, reference is made to requirements of the
Subdivision Code of the Municipal Code within this section. With regard to
these references, said Appendix C may contain the term “plat”, which under the
PD district requirements is intended to be synonymous with “plan” as
appropriate.
      (2)   Since obtaining a PD district designation requires a map amendment
(rezoning), the requirements and procedures of §§
156.170 through
156.175, Amendments shall apply. As applicable, reference to §§
156.170 through
156.175 is made within this section.
(`92 Code, § 40-5-6) (Ord. 00-11, passed 7-5-00)
§ 156.116 TYPES OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   An area approved for the PD designation shall be assigned one of the
following district classifications which shall be considered a separate zoning
district and subject to the specific restrictions and limitations outlined in
this section.
   (A)   Planned Development - Residential (PD-R). Planned developments
involving residential uses only.
   (B)   Planned Development - Business (PD-B). Planned developments involving
retail, service, and office commercial uses only.
(`92 Code, § 40-5-7) (Ord. 00-11, passed 7-5-00)
§ 156.117 PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Planned development - Residential (PD-R).
      (1)   Permitted uses shall be established in the conditions of the
chapter adopted by the Board of Trustees governing the particular Planned
Development - Residential district. Specific uses may include those uses
designated as permitted or special uses in the SR-1, SR-2, MR-1 or MR-
2 districts.
      (2)   In addition to those uses included above, the following uses may be
designated as permitted uses and established as such in the chapter governing
the particular Planned Development - Residential district:
         (a)   Patio dwellings;
         (b)   Zero lot line residential developments.
   (B)   Planned Development - Business (PD-B). Permitted uses shall be
established in the conditions of the chapter adopted by the Board of Trustees
governing the particular Planned Development - Commercial district. Specific
uses may only include those uses designated as permitted or special uses in the
B-1 or B-2 districts.
(`92 Code, § 40-5-8) (Ord. 00-11, passed 7-5-00)
§ 156.118 MINIMUM PLANNED DEVELOPMENT SITE SIZE.
   The minimum site size for any of the Planned Development districts shall be
two acres. This minimum site size may be waived by the Board of Trustees upon
report by the Planning Commission if it is determined that the use proposed is
desirable or necessary in relationship to the surrounding neighborhood or, if
the Board of Trustees should determine such waiver to be in the general public
interest.
(`92 Code, § 40-5-9) (Ord. 00-11, passed 7-5-00)
§ 156.119 DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   General standards.
      (1)   The approval of the Development Plan may provide for such
exceptions from the regulations associated with traditional zoning districts as
may be necessary or desirable to achieve the objectives of the proposed planned
development. No Planned Development shall be allowed which would result in:
         (a)   Inadequate or unsafe vehicular access to the development;
         (b)   Peak-hour traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the
adjoining or nearby streets. Capacity shall be based on a street providing
“level of service D” as defined in the latest publication of Transportation and
Traffic Engineers Handbook, Institute of Transportation Engineers;
         (c)   An undue burden on public parks, recreation areas, schools, fire
and police protection and other public facilities which serve or are proposed
to serve the planned development;
         (d)   A failure to comply with the performance standards contained in
§
156.119;
         (e)   Other detrimental impacts on the surrounding area including, but
not limited to, visual and noise pollution.
      (2)   In addition to the above requirements, all planned developments
shall be subject to the review criteria established in §
156.114. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to clearly establish
that the above requirements are met.
   (B)   Other codes. All requirements of other codes and ordinances of the
City (such as Building Code) shall be applicable.
   (C)   Planned Development - Residential (PD-R).
      (1)   Density. The density of residential development - shall be
consistent with the intent of the original underlying residential district(s).
While the district regulations specifies upper limits to residential density,
density of a Planned Development may be limited to that which is established in
the original residential district or which is consistent and compatible with
nearby existing developed areas. Conversely, the density limits indicated in
the district regulations may be exceeded on portions of the site within a PD-
R district as long as the total site density limit is not exceeded. This is
referred to as “density transfer”. Additionally, the total site density may be
exceeded up to a limit, upon conclusion of the Plan Commission and the Board of
Trustees that the density bonus provisions contained in division (C) below have
been satisfied. This is referred to as “density bonus”.
      (2)   Calculation of density.
         (a)   The computation of density shall be based on dwelling units per
net acre for the entire site.
         (b)   To compute the number of dwelling units per net acre, 15% of the
gross acreage of the parcel shall be deducted and the net acreage divided by
the lowest minimum lot size of the underlying residential district. The
following provides an example of density calculation for a 20 acre tract in the
residential district:
20 acres x 43,560 square feet per acre = 871,200 sq. ft.
871,200 sq. ft. - (871,200 x 0.15) = 740,520 sq. ft.
740,520/6,000 sq. ft. min, lot size = 123 dwelling units
         (c)   In situations where a proposed PD-R district overlaps two or
more dwelling districts, density shall be calculated separately for the
portions of the PD-R district in each of the original residential districts.
      (3)   Density bonus. The Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of
Trustees may approve an increase in density within a PD-R district, up to a
maximum of 20%, which shall be based on the precepts listed below. The density
bonuses shall be treated as additives and not compounded.
 
Maximum Percentage Increase Design Element
                            A minimum of an additional 5% of the net
                            development area devoted to common open space
10%                         (above the minimum requirement) and improved with
                            public pedestrian ways, bike paths, park land,
                            swimming pools, tennis courts, community centers,
                            club buildings, etc.
                            Creative site designs and building groupings, which
                            take advantage of natural terrain and resolve
5%                          existing on-site and off-site water run-off and
                            erosion problems. The provision of storm drainage
                            retention as a site amenity is encouraged.
                            Variations in building design are permissible.
                            Creative use of landscape materials and the
5%                          provision of more extensive landscaping than would
                            otherwise be required under the landscaping
                            requirements found elsewhere in this chapter.
 
   If density bonuses (increases) are requested under this section, the
applicant shall document all site amenities or improvements for the village’s
review and consideration.
      (4)   Development phasing. If the sequence of construction of various
portions of the development is to occur in stages, then the open space and/or
recreational facilities shall be developed, or legally provided for on a final
plat, in reasonable proportion to the number of dwelling units intended to be
developed during any given stage of construction as approved on a final plat by
the Board of Trustees. Furthermore, at no time during the construction of the
project shall the number of constructed dwelling units per acre of developed
land exceed the overall density per net acre established by the approved PD-
R district.
      (5)   Non-residential uses in PD-R developments. Non-residential uses are
limited to those specifically listed in the dwelling zoning districts. Such
non-residential uses shall be subject to all requirements for lot area, width,
height, yards and setbacks prescribed in the district in which the proposed PD-
R development is located.
      (6)   Common open space requirements.
         (a)   Common open space shall comprise at least 15% of the gross area
of the residential development or be of a size equivalent to one acre for each
100 persons of expected population of the development, whichever is greater.
For purposes of this subsection, the expected population shall be determined by
multiplying the total number of dwelling units times 2 persons per dwelling
unit.
         (b)   The amount of required common open space may be reduced by an
amount equal to twice the total area of private balconies or patios. The
balconies or patios shall be accessible to individual dwelling units, consist
of at least 60 square feet of outdoor area, and have at least a horizontal
dimension of six or more feet. In no case shall the area devoted to common open
space be less than 10% of the gross lot area.
         (c)   Common open space shall be used for recreational, park or
environmental amenity purposes for the collective enjoyment of the occupants of
the development.
         (d)   In addition to the above open space requirements, the following
regulates the use of this common open space in terms of physical surface
characteristics, size, location and physical improvements therein.
            1.   Of the required common open space, up to one-half of it may be
covered by water, flood plain, stormwater detention/retention facilities or
left in a natural state.
            2.   The area of each parcel of open space shall not be less than
6,000 square feet in area nor less than 30 feet in its smallest dimension. In
addition, at least 50% of the common open space shall be contiguous or
connected via pedestrian/bicycle paths.
            3.   To the extent practicable, common open spaces should be
distributed equitably throughout the development in relation to the dwelling
units that such common open space is intended to serve. The open space shall
not be isolated in one corner of a development, but shall be highly accessible
(physically and/or visually) to the residents of the development.
         (e)   Where common open space is to be provided in a subdivided
residential development, the use, operation, and maintenance of areas for
common open space, common ground, and common buildings shall be guaranteed by
the establishment of a trust indenture providing for such by a subdivision
association or trustees. Said indenture shall be approved by the Village
Attorney prior to recording the indenture simultaneously with the recording of
the final plat.
      (7)   Perimeter buffer requirements.
         (a)   Where a PD-R development proposes residential development along
the perimeter of the site, which is higher in density than that of an adjacent
dwelling district, there shall be a minimum 30 foot wide buffer area. The
buffer area shall be kept free of buildings or structures and shall be
landscaped or protected by natural features so that all higher-density
residential buildings are effectively screened from the abutting lower density
residential property.
         (b)   Where a PD-R development abuts a commercial or industrial use or
district, there shall be a minimum 30 foot wide buffer area. This buffer area
shall be permanent and landscaped and/or otherwise provided with screening
(such as sight proof fencing) so as to effectively screen the commercial or
industrial use form the PD-R development.
      (8)   Payment for allocation. In addition to providing the required areas
of common open space within the residential development, the owner/developer
shall pay to the village for allocation to the Park Improvement Fund the sum of
$500 per dwelling unit. This payment shall be paid at the time of approval of
the final plat of the subdivision by the Board of Trustees of the village. If
the payment is not made to the village at such time, the Mayor shall not sign
the final plat for recording purposes.
   (D)   Planned Development - Business (PD-B).
      (1)   Site coverage. Total site coverage by uses permitted in the PD-
B districts shall be 70%, except as permitted to be exceeded in accordance with
subsection (b) below.
      (2)   Site coverage bonus. The Plan Commission may recommend and the
Board of Trustees may approve an increase in maximum site coverage from 70% up
to 90%. In order to qualify for this bonus, the development plan must
demonstrate compliance with four or more of the following performance criteria:
         (a)   Incorporate storm drainage retention facilities as a site
amenity.
         (b)   Install storm drainage detention facilities underground.
         (c)   Increasing parking lot landscaping by 50% more than otherwise
required.
         (d)   Submitting for approval developments on tracts that are five or
more acres in size.
         (e)   Design of principal access to the development tract at an
approved location that allows for shared access by an adjacent property.
         (f)   Construction of separate-grade pedestrian and bicycle paths.
         (g)   Providing for screened loading areas.
         (h)   Demonstration of a development using innovative architectural,
site planning and land use design and of such quality as to set an excellent
example for subsequent development or redevelopment projects.
         (i)   Any other performance criteria that further the goals,
objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan and that, in the opinion of
the Plan Commission and Board of Trustees warrant the approval of development
bonuses.
      (3)   Signage. Signage shall be in compliance with §
156.049 unless the applicant for a PD-B district designation elects to submit a
“Comprehensive Sign Plan” in addition to the submission of other required
development plan documents. The Plan Commission may recommend, and the Board of
Trustees may approve, a Comprehensive Sign Plan and such plan shall be made
part of the chapter approving the PD district. This chapter may contain
conditions, requirements or standards regarding signs that may be stipulated by
the Board of Trustees. Comprehensive Sign Plans approved under this section
shall be evaluated based upon the following criteria:
         (a)   Placement. All signs shall be placed where they are sufficiently
visible and readable for their function. Factors to be considered shall include
the purpose of the sign, its location relative to traffic movement and access
points, site features, structures and sign orientation relative to viewing
distances and viewing angles.
         (b)   Quantity. The number of signs that may be approved within any
development shall be no greater than that required to provide project
identification and entry signs, internal circulation and directional
information to destinations and development sub-areas and business
identification. Factors to be considered shall include the size of the
development, the number of development sub areas, and the division or
integration of sign functions.
         (c)   Size. All signs shall be no larger than necessary for visibility
and readability. Factors to be considered in determining appropriate size shall
include topography, volume of traffic, speed of traffic, visibility range,
proximity to adjacent uses, amount of sign copy, placement of display (location
and height), lettering style and the presence of distractive influences. In no
event shall a plan contain a sign that exceeds by more than 50% that of any
maximum area standard contained in § 156.049 unless otherwise waived by the
Board of Trustees.
         (d)   Materials. Sign materials shall be compatible with architectural
and/or natural features of the project. This may be accomplished through
similarity of materials for sign structures and faces, the use of complementary
colors, similarity of architectural style or the use of consistent lettering
style and typography. A request for approval for a comprehensive Sign Plan
shall accompany the request for PD-B zoning classification and shall include,
but is not limited to, the following:
            1.   A site plan, depicting the proposed plan of development and
illustration of proposed sign locations;
            2.   Descriptions and drawings indicating size, qualities,
materials and illumination; and
            3.   A narrative description of the common theme for signage within
the development, how it relates to architectural and/or landscaping elements of
the development, and how the Comprehensive Sign Plan relates to each of the
criteria set forth in this section.
      (4)   Perimeter buffer requirements. Where a PD-B development abuts a
residential district, there shall be a minimum 50 foot buffer area between any
non-residential use and the adjacent residential district. This buffer area
shall be landscaped in accordance with § 156.089.
      (5)   Minimum building setbacks. Building setbacks shall be in accordance
with the approved site plan for a PD-B development. Where a commercial use
abuts a dwelling district, the minimum building setbacks established in the
district regulations shall apply.

operation of said motor vehicle oriented business, as approved by the Director
of Public Works.
      (3)   Where a business is located in a tenant space that is part of the
principal structure(s) of a strip shopping center development, and would
otherwise be considered a motor vehicle oriented business, the provisions of

be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the Board of Zoning Appeals
by general rule, by filing with the building and zoning official and with the
Board of Zoning Appeals a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The

constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An
appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of action appealed from,

Appeals after the notice of appeal has been filed with him that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate, the stay would, in his or her opinion, cause
eminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
of Zoning Appeals or by a Court of Record on application, or notice to the
building and zoning official and on due cause shown. The board shall select a

(`92 Code, § 40-7-3)
§ 156.158 POWER AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have all the powers and duties prescribed
by law and by this chapter, including the following:
   (A)   Interpretation. Upon an appeal from a decision by any administrative
official, to decide any question involving the interpretation of any provision
or term of this chapter, including the determination of the exact location of
any district boundary if there is uncertainty with respect thereto;
   (B)   Variances. To vary or adapt the strict application of any of the
requirements of this chapter in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow,
shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby such
strict application would result in such practical difficulty and/or unnecessary
hardship as would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or
building involved, but in no other case. In granting any variance, the Board
shall prescribe any conditions that it deems to be necessary or desirable for
the public interest, convenience or welfare. However, any “use variance” shall
be subject to the applicable provisions of § 156.114, and no other variance in
the application of any provisions of this chapter shall be granted by the Board
unless it finds:
      (1)   That there are special circumstances or conditions fully described
in the findings, applying to the land or buildings for which the variances are
sought, which circumstances or conditions are peculiar to such land or
buildings and do not apply generally to the land or buildings in the
neighborhood, and that said circumstances or conditions are such that strict
application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of a
reasonable use of such land or building;
      (2)   That, for reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of
the variances necessary for the reasonable use of land or buildings, and that
the variance as granted by the Board is the minimum variance that will
accomplish this purpose;
      (3)   That the granting of this variance will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. In addition to
considering the character and use of adjoining buildings and those in the
vicinity, the Board, in making its findings, shall take into account whether
the condition of the subject premises is peculiar to the lot or tract described
in the petition or is merely part of the general condition of the neighborhood
which would appropriately be the proper jurisdiction of the Village Board of
Trustees for consideration of rezoning of the area rather than a variance which
would affect only a small segment of the area.
   (C)   Permits for variances and special permits. To issue or authorize

§ 157.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPMENT. 
      (1)   Any man-made change to real estate including, but not necessarily
limited to:
         (a)   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building;
         (b)   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
         (c)   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site
for a manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on as site for more
than 180 days per year;

culverts or similar projects;
         (e)   Construction or erection of levees, dams, walls, or fences;
         (f)   Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating,
paving, or other alterations of the ground surface;
         (g)   Storage of materials including the placement of gas and liquid
storage tanks; and
         (h)   Channel modifications or any other activity that might change
the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include routine maintenance of existing
buildings and facilities; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar
practices that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface water from any source.
   FLOODPLAIN. Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any
source. (See FLOOD.)
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure transportable in one or more sections, that
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.
   STRUCTURE. For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including gas or liquid storage tanks, that is principally above ground. The
term includes RVs and travel trailers on site for more than 180 days.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred
regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must
be included in this determination.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places.
