into any contract with the county having a value or expense in excess of

(Ord. O-2011.02, passed 3-8-2011)
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY AND COMPLAINT PROCEDURE
§ 36.15  STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   (A)   It is the county’s policy that it will not tolerate the sexual
harassment of any employee by any other employee of this county. Sexual
harassment is an unlawful employment practice in violation of 42 USC 2000e et
seq., Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as 775 ILCS 5/
1-101 et seq., the Illinois Human Rights Act. Sexual harassment subjects the
harasser to liability for any such unlawful conduct.
   (B)   SEXUAL HARASSMENT includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors, or any other visual, verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual
nature when:
      (1)   Submission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
condition of the individual’s employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for
an employment decision affecting the harassed employee; or
      (3)   The harassment has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with the employee’s work performance or creating an environment
which is intimidating, hostile, or offensive to the employee.
   (C)   Each employee must exercise his or her own good judgment to avoid
engaging in conduct that may be perceived by others as sexual harassment. The
following are illustrations of actions that the county deems inappropriate and
in violation of county policy:
      (1)   A supervisor tells an employee or implies that he or she can earn a
promotion or salary increase by providing any form of sexual favor to or dating
the supervisor;
      (2)   A supervisor downgrades an employee’s performance rating because he
or she turned down the supervisor’s request for any sexual favor or date;
      (3)   An employee gives unwelcome hugs, kisses, massages, or makes other
unwelcome physical contact with another employee;
      (4)   An employee tells sexually offensive or degrading jokes or stories;
      (5)   An employee uses sexually oriented profanity;
      (6)   An employee makes offensive gestures of a sexual nature or
repeatedly stares at another;
      (7)   An employee makes unwelcome comments about the appearance or
anatomy of another;
      (8)   The work place contains pictures of naked or scantily clothed men
or women, or sexually explicit pictures or text;
      (9)   An employee interferes with another’s movement by blocking or
standing in an uncomfortably close proximity; and/or
      (10)   An employee repeatedly asks another for a date after being turned
down in a manner that does not invite a further invitation.
(Res. 2002.5, passed - -2002)
§ 36.16  APPLICABLE PROCEDURES.
   The county takes allegations of sexual harassment very seriously. It will
actively investigate all complaints.
   (A)   Bringing a complaint.
      (1)   Any employee of the county, or an employee of a county official,
who believes that he or she has been the victim of sexual harassment may bring
the matter to the attention of the county in one of the following ways:
         (a)   Advising his or her supervisor; or
         (b)   Advising the County State’s Attorney, or the County Clerk in the
event that the alleged harasser is the State’s Attorney.
      (2)   If the complaint involves someone in the employee’s direct line of
command, then the employee should go directly to the State’s Attorney.
      (3)   The complaint should be presented as promptly as possible after the
alleged harassment occurs.
      (4)   All complaints will be handled with the utmost discretion.
   (B)   Resolution of a complaint.
      (1)   Promptly after a complaint is submitted, the county will undertake
such investigation, corrective, and preventative actions as are appropriate. In
general, the procedure in resolving any complaints can (but will not
necessarily) include any of the following items:
         (a)   Private conferences between the employee making the complaint
and an individual designated by the county to investigate such complaints.
Important data to be provided by the complaining employee includes the
following:
            1.   A description of the specific offensive conduct;
            2.   Identification of all person(s) who engaged in the conduct;
            3.   The location where the conduct occurred;
            4.   The time when the conduct occurred;
            5.   Whether there were any witnesses to the conduct;
            6.   Whether conduct of a similar nature has occurred on prior
occasions;
            7.   Whether there are any documents which would support the
complaining employee’s allegations; and
            8.   What impact the conduct had on the complaining employee.
         (b)   If, after this initial meeting between the complaining employee
and the county representative, the employee decides to proceed further with the
matter, then a written statement will be submitted to the county by the
individual who conducted the initial interview with the employee. Cases
involving sexual harassment are particularly sensitive and demand special
attention to issues of confidentiality. Therefore, the information provided
either informally or by the written statement will not be released to third
parties, except as provided or required by law.
         (c)   After a written statement of complaint is submitted by the
employee, the alleged offending employee will be contacted by a designated
representative of the county. The alleged offending employee will be advised of
the charges brought against him or her, and may be provided with a copy of the
written statement of complaint made by the complaining employee. The alleged
offending employee will have an opportunity to fully explain his or her side of
the circumstances, and may also submit a written statement, if desired.
         (d)   After the alleged offending employee is interviewed, any
witnesses identified by either the complaining employee or the alleged
offending employee will be interviewed.
         (e)   Once this investigation is completed, the county will take such
action as is appropriate based upon the information obtained in the
investigation. In the event that the county finds merit in the charges made by
the complaining employee, disciplinary action will be taken against the
offending employee. This disciplinary action may, but need not necessarily,
include:
            1.   Verbal or written reprimand;
            2.   Placing the offending employee on probation for a period of
time to be identified;
            3.   Delay in pay increases or promotions;
            4.   Suspending the offending employee from work without pay; or
            5.   Immediate termination.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will there be any retaliation against any
employee making a complaint of sexual harassment.
      (3)   Questions concerning the county’s policies on this matter should be
addressed to the State’s Attorney. Further information may also be obtained
from the State Department of Human Rights, or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.

of-way, or easement that adjoins or abuts the premises for which the permit is
requested, or when the improvement to be served is located within a reasonable
distance of a public sewer to which a connection is practical and is permitted

notified at least one day prior to the performance of all tests and may
supervise any test.
   (J)   The Health Department shall be notified of any modification, change or
repair to any private sewage disposal system by either a home owner or
contractor to determine whether that modification, change, or repair requires a
permit as set forth in division (B) of this section. The routine cleaning of
disposal system components, replacing septic tank cover, or rodding out inlet
and outlets, does not require a construction permit as defined under this
section.
   (K)   There may be a fee charged for the initial construction permit,
alteration or extension of an individual sewage system. The fee shall be
collected by the Health Department at the time an application for permit is

written request for a hearing before the health authority. The health authority
shall hold a hearing at a time and place designated by him or her within 30
days from the date of which the written request was filed. The petitioner for
the hearing shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing not less
than five days prior to the date on which the hearing is to be held. If as a
result of the hearing, the health authority finds that strict compliance with
the order, or notice, would cause undue hardship on the petitioner, and that
the public health would be adequately protected and substantial justice done by
varying or withdrawing the order or notice, the health authority may modify or
withdraw the order or notice and as a condition for such action may, where he
or she deems it necessary, make requirements which are additional to those
prescribed in this section for the purpose of properly protecting the public
health. The health authority shall render a decision within ten days after the

designated by the Secretary of the Board of Health within 30 days of the date
on which the written request was filed. The petitioner for the hearing shall be
notified of the time and place of the hearing not less than five days prior to
the date on which the hearing is to be held. If, as a result of facts elicited
as a result of the Private Sewage Committee hearing, the Board of Health finds
that strict compliance with the decision of the health authority would cause
undue hardship on the petitioner, and that the public health would be
adequately protected and substantial justice done by granting a variance from
the decision of the Administrator or Acting Administrator, the Board of Health
Private Sewage Committee may grant a variance and as a condition of such
variance, may, where it deems necessary, make requirements which are additional
to those prescribed by this chapter, all for the purpose of properly protecting
the public health. The Board of Health Private Sewage Committee will render a
decision within ten days after the date of the hearing which shall be reduced
to writing and placed on file in the office of the Health Department and a copy
thereof shall be served on the petitioner personally or by delivery to the
petitioner by certified mail.

§ 90.50  SCOPE.
   (A)   In order to have a dog deemed VICIOUS as defined in this chapter, the
Administrator, deputy administrator, or law enforcement officer must give
notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the owner,
conduct a thorough investigation, interview any witnesses, including the owner,
gather any existing medical records, veterinary medical records or behavioral
evidence, and make a detailed report finding that the dog is a vicious dog and
give the report to the States Attorney office and the owner. The Administrator,
State’s Attorney or any citizen of the county in which the dog exist may file a
complaint in the circuit court in the name of the People of the State of
Illinois to deem a dog to be a vicious dog. Testimony of a board certified
veterinarian or another recognized expert may be relevant to the court’s

prove the dog is a vicious dog by clear and convincing evidence. The
Administrator will determine where the animal shall be confined during the
pendency of the case.
   (B)   (1)   A dog may not be declared vicious if the court determines the
conduct of the dog was justified because:
         (a)   The threat, injury, or death was sustained by a person who at
the time was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the
dog, or upon the property of the owner or custodian of the dog;
         (b)   The injured, threatened, or killed person was abusing or
assaulting the dog; or
         (c)   The dog was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting
itself, its owner, custodian, or member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
      (2)   No dog shall be declared VICIOUS if it is a professionally trained
dog for law enforcement or guard duties. Vicious dogs shall not be classified
in a manner that is specific as to breed.
      (3)   If the burden of proof has been met, the court shall deem the dog
to be a vicious dog.
   (C)   No landlord or landlord’s agent shall knowingly permit any tenant to
move a vicious dog into or keep a vicious dog in any building or premises owned
or controlled by such landlord or agent. No landlord or landlord’s agent shall
knowingly permit any tenant to keep a vicious dog in any building or premises
owned or controlled by such landlord or agent. Any landlord or agent thereof
learning of any vicious dog in any building or premises owned or controlled by
such a landlord or agent thereof shall notify the person having such dog to
remove the dog from the premises immediately.
   (D)   Owner of rental property, landlord or landlord’s agent that allows or
permits a vicious dog on his or her rental property, to stay in any of rental
buildings, or helps hide a vicious dog in any of the rental buildings, will be
responsible for any damage that the dog may cause if the animal attacks a

control agency shall impound the dog and the owner shall pay a $500 fine plus
impoundment fees to the animal control agency impounding the dog. The judge has
the discretion to order a vicious dog be euthanized. A dog found to be a
vicious dog will not be released to the owner until the Administrator, an
Animal Control Warden, or the Director approves the enclosure. No owner or
keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away the dog without approval from

      (2)   Any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog and which is not
confined to an enclosure shall be impounded by the Administrator, an animal
control warden, or the law enforcement authority having jurisdiction in such
area. If the owner of the dog has not appealed the impoundment order to the
Circuit Court in the county in which the animal was impounded within 15 days,
the dog may be euthanized.
      (3)   Upon filing a notice of appeal, the order of euthanasia shall be
automatically stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. The owner shall bear
the burden of timely notification to animal control in writing.
      (4)   Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the
physically handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police-owned dogs are exempt from
this section; provided, an attack or injury to a person occurs while the dog is
performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this section,
each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in accordance with
this chapter. It shall be the duty of the owner of such exempted dog to notify
the Administrator of changes of address. In the case of a sentry or guard dog,
the owner shall keep the Administrator advised of the location where such dog
will be stationed. The Administrator shall provide police and fire departments
with a categorized list of such exempted dogs, and shall promptly notify such
departments of any address changes reported to him or her.
   (C)   If the animal control agency has custody of the dog, the agency may
file a petition with the court requesting that the owner be ordered to post
security. The security must be in an amount sufficient to secure payment of all
reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by the animal control agency or
animal shelter in caring for and providing for the dog pending the
determination. Reasonable expenses include, but are not limited to, estimated
medical care and boarding of the animal for 30 days. If security has been
posted in accordance with this section, the animal control agency may draw from
the security the actual costs incurred by the agency in caring for the dog.
   (D)   Upon receipt of a petition, the court must set a hearing on the
petition, to be conducted within five business days after the petition is
filed. The petitioner must serve a true copy of the petition upon the
defendant.
   (E)   If the court orders the posting of security, the security must be
posted with the Clerk of the Court within five business days after the hearing.
If the person ordered to post security does not do so, the dog is forfeited by
operation of law and the animal control agency must dispose of the animal
through adoption or humane euthanization.

(Ord. 94.50, passed 6-13-1994; Ord. 0-97.5, passed 11-10-1997)
§ 111.26  INSPECTION FREQUENCY.
   (A)   An inspection of a food establishment shall be performed in accordance
with the following guidelines:
      (1)   High risk facilities shall receive three inspections per year, two
inspections per year if one of the following conditions is met:
         (a)   A certified food service manager is present at all times the
facility is in operation; or
         (b)   Employees involved in food operations receive a HACCP training
exercise, in-service training in another food sanitation area, or attend an
educational conference on food safety or sanitation.
      (2)   Medium risk facilities shall receive two inspections per year; and
      (3)   Low risk facilities shall receive one inspection every year.
   (B)   For each facility, the local health department shall assess the
relative risks of causing foodborne illness; classify each facility as high
risk, medium risk, or low risk; and annually verify the classification of each
facility.
      (1)   HIGH RISK means that a facility presents a high relative risk of
causing foodborne illness based on the large number of food handling operations
typically implicated in foodborne outbreaks and the type of population served
by the facility. The following criteria shall be used to classify high risk
facilities:
         (a)   Whenever cooling of potentially hazardous foods occurs as part
of the food handling operations at the facility;
         (b)   When potentially hazardous foods are prepared hot or cold and
held hot or cold for more than 12 hours before serving;
         (c)   If potentially hazardous foods which have been previously cooked
and cooled must be reheated;
         (d)   When preparing potentially hazardous food for off-premises
service for which time-temperature requirements during transportation, holding,
and service are relevant;
         (e)   Whenever complex preparation of foods, or extensive handling of
raw ingredients with hand contact for ready-to-eat foods, occurs as part of the
food handling operations at the facility;
         (f)   If vacuum packaging and/or other forms of reduced oxygen
packaging are performed at the retail level; or
         (g)   Whenever serving immuno- compromised individuals, where these
individuals comprise the majority of the consuming population.
      (2)   MEDIUM RISK means that a facility presents a medium relative risk
of causing foodborne illness based upon few food handling operations typically
implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks. The following criteria shall be used
to classify medium risk facilities:
         (a)   If hot or cold foods are not maintained at that temperature for
more than 12 hours and are restricted to same day service;
         (b)   If preparing foods for service from raw ingredients uses only
minimal assembly; and
         (c)   Foods served at an establishment that require complex
preparation (whether canned, frozen, or fresh prepared) are obtained from
approved food processing plants, (high risk) food service establishments or
retail food stores.
      (3)   LOW RISK means a facility presents a low relative risk of causing
foodborne illness based upon few or no food handling operations typically
implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks. The following criteria shall be used
to classify low risk facilities:
         (a)   Only pre-packaged foods are available or served in the facility,
and any potentially hazardous foods available are commercially pre-packaged in
an approved food processing plant;
         (b)   Only limited preparation of non-potentially hazardous foods and
beverages, such as snack foods and carbonated beverages, occurs at the
facility; or
         (c)   Only beverages (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) are served at the
facility.
   (C)   The Department recognizes that the local health department’s
experience with a facility is an important factor in assessing the relative
risk of foodborne illness for the public. A local health department may
reclassify a facility based upon its experience with the facility (e.g.,
inspection history, number and frequency of violations and their severity,
corrective actions, and the like) if, in its opinion, a health hazard will not
result from such reclassification or such reclassification will provide better
protection for the public. The basis for this decision must be documented and
be available for Department inspection.

   A designated representative of the Health Department, after proper
identification, shall be permitted to enter any food establishment at any
reasonable time for the purpose of making inspections to determine compliance
with this chapter; and shall be permitted to examine the records of the
establishment to obtain information pertaining to food and supplies purchased,
received, or used.
(Ord. 94.50, passed 6-13-1994; Ord. 0-97.5, passed 11-10-1997)
§ 111.28  REPORT OF INSPECTION.
   Whenever an inspection of a food establishment is made, the findings shall
be recorded on the inspection report form. The inspection report form shall
summarize the requirements of this chapter and shall set forth a weighted point
value of each requirement.  Inspectional remarks shall be written as specific
violations noted to reference, by any section number, the section violated in
the Food Service Sanitation Rules and Regulations or the Retail Food Store
Sanitation Rules and Regulations, and shall state the correction to be made.
The rating score of the establishment shall be the total of the weighted point
values for all violations, subtracted from 100. A copy of the completed
inspection report form is a public document that shall be made available for
public disclosure to any person who requests it according to law. A copy of the
completed inspection report shall be left at the establishment.
(Ord. 94.50, passed 6-13-1994; Ord. 0-97.5, passed 11-10-1997)
§ 111.29  CORRECTION OF VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   The completed inspection report form shall specify a reasonable
period of time for the correction of the violations found; and correction of
the violations shall be accomplished within the period specified, in accordance
with the following provision: If an imminent health hazard exists, such as
complete lack of refrigeration or sewage backup into the establishment, the
establishment shall immediately cease food operations. Operations shall not be
resumed until authorized by the Health Department.
      (2)   All serious violations shall be corrected as soon as possible, in
any event, within the time period specified on the inspection report. The
designated representative of the Health Department, conducting the inspection
is to determine if a reinspection is necessary and when the reinspection is to
occur and so state on the inspection report. All other violations shall be
corrected as soon as possible, but in any event, by the time of the next
routine inspection.
      (3)   When the rating score of the establishment is less than 60, the
establishment shall initiate corrective action on all identified violations
within 48 hours. One or more reinspections will be conducted at reasonable time
intervals to assure correction.
      (4)   In the case of temporary food service establishment, all violations
shall be corrected within 24 hours. If violations are not corrected within 24
hours, the establishment shall immediately cease food operations until
authorized to resume by the Health Department.
   (B)   The inspection report shall state that failure to comply with any time
limits for corrections may result in cessation of food operations. An
opportunity for hearing on the inspection findings or the time limitations or
both will be provided if a written request is filed with the Health Department
within ten days following cessation of operations. If a request for hearing is
received, a hearing shall be held within 20 days of the receipt of the request.
   (C)   Whenever a food establishment is required under the provisions to
cease operations, it shall not resume operations until it is shown on
reinspection that conditions responsible for the order to cease operations no
longer exist. Opportunity for reinspection shall be offered within a reasonable
time.

§ 111.30  EXAMINATION AND CONDEMNATION OF FOOD.
   Food may be examined or sampled by the Health Department as often as may be
necessary to determine freedom from adulteration or misbranding. The Health
Department may, upon written notice to the owner or person in charge, place a
hold order on any food which is or may be unwholesome or otherwise adulterated,
or misbranded. Under a hold order, food shall be permitted to be suitably
stored. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or alter a hold order,
notice or tag placed on food by the Health Department, and neither such food
nor the containers thereof shall be re-labeled, re-packed, reprocessed,
altered, disposed of, or destroyed without permission of the Health Department,
except of order by a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon determining the
wholesomeness or verifying the labeling of a product, the Health Department may
vacate the hold order, or may, by written order, direct the owner or person in
charge of the food which was placed under the hold order to denature or destroy
such food or to bring it into compliance with the provisions of this chapter;
provided that such order of the Health Department to denature or destroy such
food or bring it into compliance with the provision of this chapter shall be
stayed if the order is appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction within
three days.

   The unlimited operation of an adult business can, by reason of its intended
use, facilitate secondary effects including, but limited to, prostitution,
disorderly conduct, performance of sexual acts or conduct in public, traffic
congestion and parking problems. Insofar as the city has a substantial

neighborhoods and minimizing the disruptive effect of such adult businesses on
neighborhoods, the following limitations on operation times have been
propounded: live adult entertainment (performances) shall only be allowed
during the hours of 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. the following day. No operator,

government interest in these matters, all signs advertising or promoting the
sale of adults-only items must meet the following restrictions:

establishment shall utilize or contain any flashing lights, search lights or
spotlights, or any other similar lighting systems, or any words, lettering,

151.01   National Flood Insurance Program assurances
§ 151.01  NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM ASSURANCES.
   The County Board hereby:
   (A)   Assures the Federal Insurance Administration that it will enact as
necessary, and maintain in force in those areas having flood, mudslide (i.e.,
mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazards, adequate land use and control
measures with effective enforcement provisions consistent with the criteria set
forth in § 59 et. seq., of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations;
   (B)   Vests the County Chief Assessment Officer with the responsibility,
authority, and means to:
      (1)   Assist the Administrator, at his or her request, in the delineation
of the limits of the area having special flood, mudslide, or flood-related
erosion hazards;
      (2)   Provide information the Administrator may request concerning
present uses and occupancy of the floodplain, mudslide, or flood-related
erosion areas;
      (3)   Cooperate with federal, state, and local agencies and private firms
which undertake to study, survey, map, and identify floodplain, mudflow, or
flood-related erosion areas, and cooperate with neighboring communities with
respect to management of adjoining floodplain, mudslide, and/or flood-related
erosion areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards;
      (4)   Submit, on forms provided by the Administrator, an annual report on
the progress made during the past year within the community in the development
and implementation of floodplain management measures; and
      (5)   Upon occurrence, notify the Administrator in writing whenever the
boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or the community
has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. Include an accurate
corporate limit map suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new
corporate limits or new area for which the community has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority. The community will use
the flood insurance rate map or flood hazard boundary map published for the
community from which land areas were annexed or from that political entity that
previously had regulatory authority until the Administrator provides a map
using the new corporate limits.
   (C)   Appoints the County Chief Assessment Officer to maintain for public
inspection and to furnish upon request (for determining flood insurance premium
rates), the following information on all new and substantially improved
structures constructed within the identified special flood hazard area:
      (1)   The actual (as-built) lowest floor (including basement) elevation
in relation to mean sea level;
      (2)   Any certificates of flood-proofing;
      (3)   Whether or not a building has a basement; and
      (4)   For all floodproofed structures, the elevation to which the
structure has been floodproofed.
   (D)   Agrees to take such other official action as may be reasonable and
necessary to carry out the objectives of the program.

§ 152.042  FEES AND SECURITIES.
   (A)   Review fees.  All fees collected by the Plat Officer shall be
deposited into the general corporate fund of county. The following fees shall
apply:
      (1)   The review fee for preliminary plats and minor subdivision plat
shall be $400 a meeting plus $25 per lot.
      (2)   The review fee for final plats shall be $300 a meeting and no
charge for lots.
      (3)   If a request for a meeting other than the regular meeting of the
Planning and Subdivision Committee as established by Board rules, the applicant
shall reimburse the county for the expenses of the committee meeting. The
meeting must comply with the Open Meetings Act.
   (B)   Security requirements.
      (1)   General. 
         (a)   In order to insure that the work will be completed, letters of
credit, cash or certificates of deposit with a federally insured bank or
Savings and Loan Association must cover all engineering improvements, which are
proposed in conjunction with a new subdivision. In addition, the same types of
security will be required to insure that the roads in a new subdivision will be
maintained until the County Engineer has accepted them. If a letter of credit
is submitted as security, it must be substantially in the form that is set
forth in Appendix G and must be clean, non-declining, and irrevocable, issued
by a federally insured bank or Savings and Loan Association.
         (b)   At the time letters of credit are submitted, the owners/
developer shall notify the County Engineer in writing as to the name and
address of the Professional Engineer who will establish lines and grades and
exercise general supervision as construction progresses.
      (2)   Amount of security. The subdivider shall post good and sufficient
security with the County Clerk, copies of the same to the Plat Officer, County
Engineer, and Subdivision and Planning Committee, in the amount of 150% of the
engineer’s estimate of cost to insure completion of the improvements. In
addition, the maintenance security shall be in the amount of 15% of the amount
posted for construction.
      (3)   Release of security.
         (a)   No portion of either the construction or maintenance security
will be released as the work progresses, but the entire amount deposited must
be retained until all work covered by the security is satisfactorily completed.
         (b)   Prior to the release of construction security of subdivision
improvement, the engineer in charge of construction of such improvements will
be required to certify that all improvements have been completed in accordance
with the approved engineering plans and specifications on file.
         (c)   Such certification shall cover all engineering aspects of the
development, including but not limited to, road, detention/retention, grading,
filling, and any topographic changes. Certification shall be in writing,
submitted to and approved by the County Engineering prior to release of
securities.
         (d)   The maintenance security shall be held by the county for a
period of 18 months after the final completion of subdivision improvements as a
guarantee against any defect in the material or workmanship furnished in
connection with such improvement latent in character and not discernable at the
time of certification of completion of such improvement, and to guarantee
against any damage to such improvements by reason of settling of the ground
base, or foundations, thereof. After the termination of such 18-month period,
such deposit shall be refunded to the depositor, if no defects have developed.
If defects have developed, then the balance of such deposit after reimbursement
to the county for any amounts expended by it in the curing of such defects
shall be paid to the depositor. A certificate from the County Clerk hereof that
no delinquent general taxes and that all special assessments constituting a
lien on the whole or any part of the land to be subdivided have been paid.
      (4)   Letters of credit. When letters of credit are used to meet the
requirements of the chapter, the form in Appendix G shall be used.
(Ord. 0-2005.4, passed 11-8-2005)
DESIGN AND LAYOUT
§ 152.055  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Interpretations.  In order to promote the best possible development
and use of land, the County Engineer shall interpret the standards, provisions,
and specifications contained in this chapter liberally and in favor of the
county’s interest. Exceptions from these standards, provisions, and
specifications may be granted when shown conclusively and to the satisfaction
of the engineer that such exceptions will bring about a more logical and
desirable result than would be obtained by strict compliance. When in doubt as
to the wisdom of granting such an exception, the Engineer shall request a
decision from the Subdivision and Planning Committee and the County Board.
   (B)   Land subject to inundation.  Land subject to flooding and land deemed
by the reviewing authorities to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for
residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to
health, life, or property, or aggravate the flood hazard, but such land within
the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by
periodic or occasional inundation, or shall not produce unsatisfactory living
conditions.
   (C)   Public sites and open spaces.  All proposed plats submitted for
approval under the provisions of this chapter may allocate adequate areas for
park, school, recreational, and other public and semipublic sites. The
location, shape, extent and orientation of such areas shall be consistent with
existing and proposed topographical and other conditions, including but not
limited to, the park, school, recreational and other public and semipublic
needs of said proposed subdivision.
(Ord. 0-2005.4, passed 11-8-2005)
§ 152.056  STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   (A)   Continuation of existing streets.  Proposed streets shall, as near as
practicable, provide for the continuation, connection, or projection of streets
in surrounding areas, or may conform to a plan as may have been approved by the
County Engineer.
   (B)   Private streets.  Private streets shall be prohibited. All streets
within a platted subdivision must be dedicated to public use.
   (C)   Circulation.  The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision, but the local streets therein shall be so laid out that
their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Insofar as practical, the
street arrangement should provide proper access to schools, playgrounds,
transportation, and other community features. New street openings shall
generally be prohibited within 600 feet of any major intersection or crossing
such as those formed by a railroad and a highway, two or more highways, or from
the head of any major bridge, grade separation structure, or like facilities,
as measured along the centerline from the intersection or from such structures.
   (D)   Topographical and cultural features.  In sloping terrain, streets
shall generally run parallel to the contour of the land or preferably cross at
a slight angle therewith. The general objectives are to avoid steep roadway
grades, heavy concentrations of storm surface runoff; abnormal differentials in
building elevations at opposite sides of the street, and excessive grading
operations.
   (E)   Portion of tract.  Where the plat to be submitted includes only a part
of the tract owned by the subdivider, the county requires topography and a
sketch layout of the future street system on the un-subdivided tract at a later
date.
   (F)   Intersections.  The angle of intersection between a minor street and a
major street should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. All
other roads should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible,
and no intersection of roads at angles of less than 70 degrees shall be
permitted.
   (G)   Street jogs.  Street jogs shall be avoided whenever possible. However,
where permitted, the minimum centerline offset distance between roads entering
a common right-of-way from opposite sides will be 150 feet.
      (1)   Half street.  Half streets shall be prohibited.
      (2)   Reserve strips.  Reserve strips controlling access to roads and
streets shall not be permitted.
      (3)   Dead-end streets.  Dead-end or stub-end streets are prohibited.
However, where it is necessary to provide circulation to undeveloped property
adjacent to the boundaries of the proposed subdivision, a temporary cul-de-sac
with not less than an 80-foot turnaround easement with not less than a 60-foot
turnaround pavement with not less than six- inch base course gravel with A-
2 treatment shall be provided within the subdivision and adjacent to its limit
for what would otherwise be a stub-end street. Provision will be made by the
subdivider that when the right-of-way is extended into the adjacent property,
that portion of the turnaround in excess of the right-of-way width will revert
to the adjacent property owner or owners, and curbs and gutters will be
provided.
      (4)   Cul-de-sac.  A cul-de-sac, designed to be so permanently, shall not
be longer than 500 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a
turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 100 feet and a street
property line diameter of at least 120 feet. No cul-de-sac may intersect with
another cul-de-sac.
      (5)   Alleys.  Alleys in residential developments shall be prohibited.
Service roads shall be required in commercial and industrial developments,
except where other provisions for suitable access and off-roadway loading and
unloading are assured. Alleys may be provided at the rear of all lots or tracts
intended for multiple-family building use; however, they will not be
encouraged.
      (6)   Right-of-way.  In the case of the extension of an existing
adjoining right-of-way, having a width less than the minimum requirement, the
Subdivision and Planning Committee may approve the extension thereof at the
same width.

§ 152.057  DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Typical street standards.  Minimum dimensional standards of all
rights-of-way, pavements, sidewalks and other public improvements shall be
determined by the County Engineer.
      (1)   Urban streets. Streets within one and one-half miles of a corporate
limit shall be considered urban.
      (2)   Collector street (urban).  The following definitions apply, 60 feet
right-of-way; with sufficient width for all necessary cuts and cross section;
36 feet pavement, including curb and gutters.
      (3)   Collector street (rural).  The following definitions apply, 60 feet
right-of-way; 24 feet pavement with four feet shoulders without curb and
gutters or 27 feet pavement with curb and gutters.
      (4)   Local street (urban).  The following definitions apply, 60 feet
right-of-way; 27 feet pavement, including curb and gutter; four feet sidewalks
near property line.
      (5)   Local street (rural).  The following definitions apply, 60 feet
right-of-way; 24 feet pavement, without curb and gutters, provided suitable
storm drainage facilities are installed. In cases where lots are 100 feet or
more in width and not situated along a major street, sidewalks may not be
provided unless required by the County Board.
      (6)   Cul-de-sac.  The following definitions apply, 60 feet right-of-way;
24 feet pavement.
      (7)   Marginal access streets abutting a major road or street.  The
following definitions apply, 50 feet right-of-way; 24-foot pavement without
curb and gutters or 27-foot pavement with four-foot space for utilities.
      (8)   Crosswalks. The following definitions apply, ten-foot right-of-way;
at least four-foot paved walkway along centerline.
   (B)   Street grades.  No street grade shall be less than .5% and shall not
exceed the following with the allowances for reasonable vertical curves:
      (1)   Collector street, 6%;
      (2)   Local streets, 8%; and
      (3)   Streets shorter than 500 feet and cul-de-sacs, 10%.
   (C)   Street alignment.  Horizontal and vertical alignment shall conform to
Chapter 32 of the Illinois Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Local
Streets Manual, unless otherwise specified. Design speed shall be 30 miles per
hour.
   (D)   Intersections. The radii on both pavement edge and right-of-way is to
be 30 feet minimum at all points of intersection and 60 feet for industrial or
major street or highway intersections.
   (E)   Blocks. 
      (1)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to:
         (a)   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated;
         (b)   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
traffic; and
         (c)   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
      (2)   No block shall be longer than 1,400 feet except in unusual
circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway, the greater
dimension on the block shall front along such major highway to minimize the
number of points of ingress or egress.
      (3)   Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a crosswalk easement not
less than ten feet in width may be required, if necessary, to provide proper
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and other facilities.
      (4)   The depth and width of properties laid out or reserved for
commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-
street parking and service facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated. The permanent reservation of suitable buffer and
easement areas may be required, where deemed essential. Such areas shall
normally be made a part of abutting lots or building sites.
   (F)   Lots.
      (1)   Size, shape and orientation.  The lot size, width, depth, shape,
orientation and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the
location of the subdivision and type of development and use contemplated. A
depth and width ratio of approximately 2-1/2 to 1 is desirable. Lot depth in
relation to width shall normally not exceed a ratio of 3 to 1.
      (2)   Dimensions.  Lot dimensions and area shall not be less than the
requirements of this chapter. In subdivisions not providing full community
sewer and water facilities, increased area will be required in instances where
such need is indicated by the Soil and Water Conservation District’s
investigations and by the County Public Health Department (see § 152.069).
      (3)   Corner lots. 
         (a)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less
than 50 feet. Either of the two sides of a corner lot fronting on a street may
be designated the front of a lot, provided the rear yard shall always be
opposite the frontage so designated.
         (b)   All corner lots, be they at the intersection of the rights-of-
way of two streets or of an alley and a street, shall have a curve with a
minimum radius of 30 feet joining the two sidelines of said rights-of-way.
      (4)   Lot lines.  Side lot lines shall be at right angles or radial to
the street center line or substantially so, and along curvilinear street center
lines, side lot lines so formed shall form a lot having not less than 20 feet
of width at either the front lot ones or the rear lot line.
      (5)   Double frontage lots.  All lots shall abut an improved public
street. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots may be required where they
are desirable to provide separation of development from traffic arteries or to
overcome other disadvantages of topography or situation.
      (6)   Building sites.  Every lot shall contain a suitable building site.
Lots containing rock foundations, water courses or other adverse conditions
shall have an additional depth or width as required. Lots without a public
sewer system but with a public water system shall be no less than one acre
(43,560 square feet). Where a private individual well and septic tank is
proposed, lots shall be no less than one acre. However, a greater area may be
required for such lots if, in the opinion of the Soil and Water Conservation
District and/or County Public Health Department, there are factors or drainage,
soil conditions, or other conditions which cause potential health problems.
   (G)   Street names.  Names of new streets shall not duplicate the names of
existing street or roads of record. New streets which are extensions of, or in
alignment with, existing streets may bear the name of the existing streets. All
names shall meet with approval of the 911 Board and final approval of a
proposed subdivision by the County Board will be withheld until the developer
complies with Section 3 (a) of the 911 ordinance.
   (H)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements shall be provided, where necessary, for any surface,
underground or overhead utility service and sewage effluent discharge,
including storm water drainage. They shall have a width of ten feet and shall
be established along rear lot lines and along such other lot lines as are
required to provide continuity of alignment throughout the area served.
      (2)   When a subdivision is traversed or bounded by a water course,
drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of
such water course; and such further width or construction, or both, as will be
adequate for the purpose. It shall include an additional area of at least 15
feet adjoining both edges of the established flood plain area as certified by
the subdivider or his/her Engineer. Minimum floor elevations for structures may
be required in areas which are or may be flooded.
   (I)   Resubdivision and replatting.  The Planning and Subdivision Committee
shall, in the performance of its plat-approving function, be vigilant for
opportunities to encourage and facilitate the replatting of prematurely and
inexpertly subdivided areas, which are now in sharp contrast to current
standards of acceptability. Rehabilitation of these areas shall be implemented
through proper design considerations when adjacent and unsubdivided land is
proposed for development.
   (J)   Business and industrial subdivision.  Business and industrial areas
shall be subdivided into lots of such size, shape and arrangement as to meet
business or industrial needs. Properties reserved or laid out for business or
industrial purposes shall be large enough to provide for the setback, yard,
private sewage disposal system and off-street parking and loading facilities
required by the type of development contemplated.

REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
§ 152.065  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Developer to furnish plans for improvements. Unless otherwise
indicated, the developer, through his or her engineer, shall prepare and
furnish all plans, specifications, cost estimates, and other essential
documents necessary for the construction and installation of the required
improvements. Further, the subdivider shall agree at his or her own cost and
expense to do all the work, and furnish all the materials and labor necessary
to construct and complete the required improvements in a good and substantial
manner to the satisfaction of the County Engineer.
   (B)   Construction to be in accord with state standards. Unless otherwise
specified, all construction shall be in accordance with the provisions of the
current issue of the Standard Specification for Road and Bridge Construction by
the Illinois Department of Transportation, as the same is amended from time to
time, and hereinafter referred to as the Standard Specification.
   (C)   Specifications, supervision and inspection.
      (1)   The specifications adopted by the county shall in all respects
govern all construction work. The subdivider shall employ a Professional
Engineer who shall be responsible for establishing the proper lines and grades
for all earthwork and drainage and shall exercise general supervision as
construction progresses. For the purpose of this section, general supervision
shall mean sufficient overseeing of the project to assure that construction of
the engineering improvement is accomplished in accordance with the approval
plans and specifications.
      (2)   The work shall be done under county inspection. The County Engineer
shall not in any way be a substitute for the subdivider’s resident engineer and
inspector. It shall be completed within the time fixed or agreed upon by the
County Engineer.
   (D)   Inspection costs. The cost of inspection shall be paid by the
subdivider. An amount of money estimated by the County Engineer for such
purpose shall be deposited in advance with the County Treasurer and credited to
the County Highway Department.
   (E)   Time schedule and sequence of construction. The subdivider shall
submit a statement setting forth a scheduled time not to exceed one year,
(except in the case of an asphaltic construction, where the maximum shall be
two years) from the date of approval of the final plat, within which the
improvement required by these regulations will be completed.
   (F)   Extension of time. All construction items shall be completed within
one year of the recording of the final plat, where bituminous construction is
required, a maximum of two years shall be allowed. The County Engineer shall be
authorized to grant one and only one extension, and for a period not to exceed
six months.
   (G)   Default. If the improvements are not completed within the specified
time, the County Board may use the performance bond or any portion thereof
necessary to complete same.
   (H)   Policy on sharing cost of oversize improvements. Whenever necessary to
conform to an overall plan otherwise to protect or promote the public interest,
oversize improvements shall be installed or constructed by the subdivider,
provided, however, that the cost to the subdivider shall be no greater than
that which would result from the installation or construction of only that size
necessitated by his or her own development. The excess cost resulting from the
requirement of an oversize improvement shall be borne by the county.

structures or other improvements required or involved in the opening, widening,
or expansion of any street, road, or public way shall be of such size, width,
thickness, character, and type deemed by the County Engineer to be suitable and
appropriate to the intended use and development; and consistent with the
standards and specifications set forth in these rules and regulations.
   (B)   Curbs and gutters.
      (1)   The requirements of curbs and gutters shall vary in accordance with
the character of the area and the density of development involved. In urban
areas, curbs are necessary to control storm water runoff and to clearly define
driving and parking areas.
      (2)   Curbs shall be required on all streets where the proposed net
residential density of the subdivision exceeds four families per acre.
      (3)   Where residential lot frontages are less than 85 feet in commercial
developments or where other similar intensive urban uses exist or are
anticipated, curbs shall be required. The installation of curbs may be required
on major,  collector, and local streets, if such construction is deemed
necessary for public safety.
      (4)   Where curbs exist on abutting properties, their extension will
ordinarily be required throughout the proposed subdivision.
      (5)   Where curbs are not required, adequate gutters shall be graded and
protected by seeding or a hard surface may be required where the grade is such
as may be deemed necessary by the County Engineer.
      (6)   Concrete curb and gutter, conforming to the Illinois Department of
Transportation Specifications, shall be required.
   (C)   Pavement. Roadway pavement surface and base course shall meet the
requirements as outlined in the following table, “Minimum Pavement
Requirements,” for the various acceptable road types.
   (D)   Sidewalks. If the property subdivided is located adjacent to the
corporate limits of a community, the Subdivision and Planning Committee may
require sidewalks. If the subdivision is near a school or a commercial area,
where pedestrian traffic would be high or when an official plan element intends
sidewalks in a given area. In residential districts, sidewalks shall be
constructed when required with the near edge of the sidewalk one foot from the
property line. In industrial districts, sidewalks shall be constructed when
required next to the curb. All commercial areas shall include spaces for
pedestrian circulation. Sidewalks shall be constructed as follows:
      (1)   Residential, commercial, and industrial districts. Minimum width,
four feet; minimum thickness,  four inches, except access driveway areas where
minimum thickness shall be five inches.
