PREAMBLE
 
WHEREAS, the City has the authority to promote the health, safety and welfare
of the City and its
citizens, and to prevent the spread of blight and deterioration and inadequate public facilities, including
sanitary sewer, by promoting the development of private investment in the
marketability of property thereby increasing the tax base of the City and
providing employment for its citizens; and
WHEREAS, Pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/8-1-2.5, a municipality may appropriate and
expend funds for economic development purposes, including without limitation
for commercial enterprises that are
deemed necessary or desirable for the promotion of economic development within the community; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 ILCS 5/
11-74.4 et seq., as amended (the “Act”), the City has the authority to provide
incentives to owners or prospective owners of real property to redevelop,
rehabilitate and/or upgrade such property by reimbursing the
owner for certain costs from resulting increases in real estate tax revenues 
(“real estate tax increment”) or from other City revenues; and
WHEREAS, on May 9, 2022, recognizing the need to foster the development,
expansion and revitalization of certain properties which are vacant,
underutilized or obsolete or a combination thereof, the City approved a Tax
Increment Financing Redevelopment Plan and Projects (the “Plan”), designated a
Redevelopment Area and adopted Tax Increment Financing as provided under the
Act for the Marion Residential TIF District II (the “TIF District ”); and
WHEREAS, included in the Redevelopment Project Area is property which is owned
by the Developer, located at 1713 West Dewey Street, Marion, Illinois, real
estate tax property identification number 06-13-357-012 (the “Property”); and
WHEREAS, the Developer owns said Property and is proceeding with plans to
rehabilitate and renovate the residence located thereon 
(the “Project”), and is doing so based on the availability of TIF incentives
offered by the City; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the City to encourage economic development which
will increase the real estate tax revenue of the City, which increased
incremental taxes will be used, in part, to finance incentives to assist
development within the Tax Increment Financing District; and
 
WHEREAS, the Developer’s proposed Project is consistent with the TIF District
Redevelopment Plan
and Projects for the Redevelopment Project Area and further conforms to the land uses of the City as
 
adopted; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-4(b) of the Act, the City may make and
enter into all contracts with property owners, developers, tenants,
overlapping taxing bodies, and others necessary or incidental to the
implementation and furtherance of the Redevelopment Plan; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-4
(j) of the Act, the City may incur project redevelopment costs and reimburse
developers who incur redevelopment project costs authorized by a redevelopment
agreement and further defined in Section 5/11-74.4-3(q) of the Act, including
those Estimated TIF
Eligible Project Costs as herein listed in the attached Exhibit “1" 
of this Redevelopment Agreement; and
 
WHEREAS, the Developer requested that incentives for the development be
provided by the City from incremental increases in real estate taxes of the
City generated from its Project and the City agreed to such incentives; and
WHEREAS, the City has determined that this Project required the incentives
requested as set forth
herein and that said Project will, as a part of the Plan, promote the health, safety and welfare of the City
and its citizens by attracting private investment to prevent blight and
deterioration and to generally enhance the economy of the City; and
WHEREAS, the City has reviewed the conditions of the Property and has reason to believe that the
costs of the necessary public and private improvements to be incurred by the Developer in furtherance
of the Project are eligible project costs under the Act and are consistent with the Redevelopment Plan
of the City; and
WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed that the City shall reimburse the Developer
for a portion of its TIF Eligible Project Costs incurred in furtherance of the
Project as set forth in Section C below.
 
WHEREAS, in consideration of the execution of this Agreement, the Developer is
completing the Project as set forth in Exhibit “1" ; and
WHEREAS, 
the City is entering into this Agreement having encouraged and induced the Developer
to proceed with the Project located on said Property.
 
 
AGREEMENTS
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt
of which is acknowledged, agree as follows:
 
A.   PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS
 
1.   The Parties agree that the matters set forth in the recitals above are
true and correct and form a part of this Agreement.
 
2.   Any terms which are not defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as they do in
the Act, unless indicated to the contrary.
 
3.   The Developer shall remain in compliance with all municipal ordinances
relating to property development, property condition, zoning, subdivision and
building codes. Failure to cure the violation of any such ordinance within
thirty (30) days upon being provided written notice of the
same by the City shall be cause for th City to declare the Developer in Default and unilaterally
terminate this Agreement, except where such failure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within
such 30-day period, in which case the Developer shall have such additional time
to cure as is reasonably necessary, provided that the Developer has commenced
such cure within such 30-day period and continues to diligently prosecute the
same to completion.
 
4.   Each of the Parties represents that it has taken all actions necessary to
authorize its representatives to execute this Agreement.
 
B.   ADOPTION OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING
 
The City has created a Tax Increment Financing District known as the “Marion
Residential TIF District II” which includes the Developer’s Property. The City
has approved certain Redevelopment Project Costs, including the types described
in Exhibit “1"  for the Developer’s Project.
 
C.   INCENTIVES
 
In consideration for the Developer completing the Project as set forth herein, the City agrees to extend
to the Developer the following incentives to assist the Developer’s Project:
 
1.   The City shall reimburse the Developer Sixty Percent 
(60%) of the annual “net” incremental increase in real estate tax generated
over the base year by the Developer’s Project for the
reimbursement of the Developer’s Eligible Project Costs 
(Exhibit “1"). Said reimbursements
shall commence with the real estate tax increment derived from the real estate taxes assessed in
year 2026 and paid in 2027, and continue for the current remaining life of the
TIF District, which is tax year 2045 with final payment received in 2046, or
until all TIF eligible project costs as described in Exhibit “1" are fully
reimbursed, not to exceed a total of Seventy-one Thousand Dollars and No Cents 
($71,000.00), whichever occurs first. These funds are to be allocated to
and when collected shall be paid to the City Treasurer for deposit in a separate account within
the Special Tax Allocation Fund for the Marion Residential TIF District II
designated as the “Dennis McGuire Special Account” 
(the “Special Account”). All monies deposited into the Special Account shall be
used exclusively by the City for the purposes set forth in this Agreement.
 
2.   “Net” real estate tax increment is defined as increases in annual real estate tax increment derived
from the Developer’s Project after payment of the proportionate amount of administrative fees
and costs incurred by the City and payments pursuant to TIF District
Intergovernmental Agreements, if any. The Developer’s proportionate amount is
calculated by dividing the increment generated by the Developer’s Project by
the total TIF District increment, and multiplying the result by any such
administrative fees and costs and payments pursuant to any TIF District
Intergovernmental Agreements.
 
D.   LIMITATION OF INCENTIVES TO DEVELOPER
 
1.   The Developer shall be reimbursed by the City for all TIF Eligible Project
Costs permitted by the Act (subject to a limitation of $71,000.00) and as set
forth in Exhibit “1" from the real estate
 
tax increment generated by this Project located on the Property and deposited into the Special
Account, but only for the term of the Agreement and only from the Property
included in this Project and currently owned by the Developer at that location.
 
2.   It is not contemplated nor is the City obligated to use any of its
proportionate share of the
monies for any of the Developer’s Eligible Project Costs but, rather, the City shall use its sums
for any purpose under the Act as it may in its sole discretion determine.
 
E.   PAYMENT OF ELIGIBLE PROJECT COSTS
 
1.   Payment to the Developer for TIF Eligible Project Costs as set forth by the Act, shall be made
by a Requisition for Payment of Private Development Redevelopment Costs
(Exhibit “2", “Requisition”) submitted from time to time by the Developer to
the City’s TIF Administrator Jacob & Klein, Ltd., with copy to The Economic
Development Group, Ltd. (collectively, the
“Administrator”), and subject to the Administrator’s approval of the costs and to the availability
of funds in the Special Account.
 
2.   All Requisitions must be accompanied by verified bills or statements of
suppliers, contractors or professionals together with mechanic’s lien waivers
(whether partial or full), cancelled checks, or other proof of payment of such
bills from each of the parties entitled to a payment that is the subject of the
Requisition as required by the City.
 
3.   In order for the Developer to receive reimbursement of Eligible Project
Costs for costs it has incurred in any year as set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2
above, the Developer must submit such
proposed eligible costs to the City by March 1 of the following year. If there are no accumulated
outstanding costs previously submitted and approved by the City and if the Developer does not
submit such proposed eligible costs by this deadline, the Developer will forfeit reimbursement
of such costs from the prior year’s real estate tax increment to be paid in the current year. Any
approved eligible costs submitted after this deadline will be eligible for reimbursement from the
next year’s real estate increment receipts.
 
4.   Any real estate increment not required to be paid to the Developer under the terms of Paragraph
3 above shall be available to the City for any purpose set forth in the TIF Plan and allowed by
the Act.
 
5.   The Developer shall use such sums as reimbursement for Eligible Project
Costs only to the
extent permitted by law and the Act and may allocate such funds for any purpose for the terms
of this Agreement or the term of the TIF District whichever is longer.
 
6.   The Administrator shall approve or disapprove a Requisition by written
receipt to the Developer within thirty 
(30) business days after receipt of the Requisition. Approval of the Requisition will
not be unreasonably withheld. If a Requisition is disapproved by the Administrator the reasons
for disallowance will be set forth in writing and the Developer may resubmit
the Requisition with
such additional information as may be required and the same procedures set forth herein shall
apply to such re-submittals.
 
7.   All TIF Eligible Project Costs approved shall then be paid by the City from the Special Account
to the Developer, or to others as directed by the Developer, pursuant to the
Redevelopment Plan
and as allowed by Illinois Law. The City shall pay such approved eligible Costs annually,
 
provided the Developer has satisfied the terms of this Agreement and costs
which exceed the
amount available to pay the Developer shall carry forward, until paid, without further action of
the Developer. Payment shall be made within forty-five 
(45) days after approval subject to the terms if this Agreement and after
receipt of the increment generated by the Developer’s Redevelopment Project
from the County.
 
8.   The Parties acknowledge that the determination of Eligible Project Costs,
and, therefore, qualification for reimbursement hereunder are subject to
changes or interpretation made by amendments to the Act, administrative rules
or judicial interpretation during the term of this
Agreement. The City has no obligation to the Developer to attempt to modify those decisions
but will assist the Developer in every respect as to obtaining approval of Eligible Project Costs.
 
F.   VERIFICATION OF TAX INCREMENT
 
1.   It shall be the sole responsibility of the Developer or its designee to
provide to the City, as requested in writing, copies of all PAID real estate
tax bills, annually, for the Property.
 
2.   The failure of Developer to provide any information required herein after
written notice from the City, and the continued failure to provide such
information within (30) days after such notice,
shall be considered a breach of this Agreement and shall be cause for the City to deny payments
hereunder to the Developer, which payments are conditional upon receipt of the
foregoing information.
 
G.   REIMBURSEMENT OF THE DEVELOPER’S SHARE OF TAX OBJECTION REFUNDS
 
If a refund of tax increment 
(including any accrued statutory interest thereon) is potentially due from the
TIF Fund as the result of any tax objection, assessment challenge or formal
appeal to the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB), issuance of a
certificate of error or other such action, including
any appeals therefrom, concerning the potential
reduction of assessed value of the Property, the City may at its sole
discretion withhold the Developer’s share of any such possible refund
(including any
accrued statutory interest thereon) from future reimbursements calculated to be paid to the Developer
under this Agreement. Furthermore, the Developer is hereby obligated to provide written notice to the
City within five (5) days of filing any such objection, assessment challenge or
formal appeal to the PTAB
or other such action, including any appeals therefrom, that could potentially reduce the assessed value
of the Property. Failure to provide such notice shall be considered a breach of this Agreement and shall
be cause for the City to deny payments hereunder to the Developer.
 
Any funds withheld by the City under this Section G shall be deposited by it
into a separate interest bearing bank account. Upon final determination of the
assessed value of the Property, the City shall
pay to the Developer the principal amount due under this Agreement as recalculated. The City shall be
entitled to retain any interest earned on the account as partial payment for
the administration of the
account due to the delay of the determination of the final evaluation and recalculation of the benefits
due the Developer under this Agreement.
 
If it appears to the City that it will be unable to recover the Developer’s
share of any such refund
(including any accrued statutory interest thereon) from the remaining future
reimbursements due the Developer under this Agreement, the Developer shall
reimburse the City for the Developer’s remaining unpaid share of such refund
within thirty (30) days upon receiving written demand of the same from
 
the City.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations contained in this Section G shall remain in effect for the
remaining life of the TIF District, whether the TIF District
expires upon the current expiration of the Redevelopment Plan and Projects adopted by the City 
(tax
year 2045 payable 2046); at an earlier time if the City passes an ordinance terminating the TIF District;
or at a later time if the TIF District is legislatively extended. Furthermore, the obligations set forth in
this Section G shall survive the expiration of the TIF District if a tax
objection or other such action taken by the Developer is pending prior to the
expiration of the TIF District and shall continue until final disposition of
such action.
 
H.   LIMITED OBLIGATION
 
The City’s obligation hereunder to pay the Developer for Eligible Project Costs is a limited obligation
to be paid solely from the Special Account. Said obligation does not now and shall never constitute an
indebtedness of the City within the meaning of any State of Illinois
constitutional or statutory provision
and shall not constitute or give rise to a pecuniary liability of the City or a charge or lien against any City
fund or require the City to utilize its taxing authority to fulfill the terms
of this Agreement.
 
I.   CITY PUBLIC PROJECTS
 
The City intends to use part or all of its share of the Project’s real estate
increment for other public projects within the TIF District or within
contiguous TIF Districts as allowed by law. The City shall
be eligible for reimbursement of the cost of doing so, as well as other eligible costs incurred by the City
in the TIF District.
 
J.   LIMITED LIABILITY OF CITY TO OTHERS FOR DEVELOPER'S EXPENSES
 
There shall be no obligation by the City to make any payments to any person other than the Developer,
nor shall the City be obligated to make direct payments to any other
contractor, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman providing services or
materials to the Developer for the Developer’s Project.
 
K.   COOPERATION OF THE PARTIES
 
1.   The City and the Developer agree to cooperate fully with each other when
requested to do so
concerning the development of the Developer’s Redevelopment Project. This includes without
limitation the City assisting or sponsoring the Developer, or agreeing to
jointly apply with the Developer, for any grant, award, subsidy or additional
funding which may be available from other governmental sources as the result of
the Developer’s or City’s activities. This also includes without limitation the
Developer assisting or sponsoring the City, or agreeing to jointly apply
with the City, for any grant, award, or subsidy which may be available as the result of the City’s
or the Developer’s activities.
 
2.   The Parties agree to take such actions, including the execution and delivery of such documents,
instruments, petitions, and certifications (and, in the City’s case, the
adoption of such ordinances
and resolutions), as may be necessary or appropriate, from time to time, to carry out the terms,
provisions, and intent of this Agreement and to aid and assist each other in
carrying out said terms, provisions, and intent.
 
3.   The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other in seeking from any or
all appropriate governmental bodies all approvals 
(whether federal, state, county or local) required or useful for the
construction or improvement of property and facilities in and on the Property
or for the provision of services to the Property, including, without
limitation, wetland mitigation, gas,
telephone, and electric utility services, roads, highways, rights-of-
way, water and sanitary sewage facilities, and storm water disposal facilities.
 
L.   DEFAULT; CURE; REMEDIES
 
In the event of a default under this Redevelopment Agreement by any party
hereto (the “Defaulting
Party”), which default is not cured within the cure period provided for below, then the other Party 
(the “Non-defaulting Party”), may have an action for damages, or, in the event
damages would not fairly compensate the Non-defaulting Parties for the
Defaulting Party’s breach of this Redevelopment Agreement, the Non-
defaulting Party shall have such other equity rights and remedies as are available
to them at law or in equity. Any damages payable by the City hereunder shall be
limited to the real estate tax increment payable to the Developer under the
terms of this Agreement.
 
In the event a Defaulting Party shall fail to perform a monetary covenant which
it is required to perform under this Redevelopment Agreement, it shall not be
deemed to be in default under this Redevelopment
Agreement unless it shall have failed to perform such monetary covenant within thirty 
(30) days of its receipt of a notice from a Non-
defaulting Party specifying that it has failed to perform such monetary
covenant. In the event a Defaulting Party fails to perform any nonmonetary covenant as and when it
is required to under this Redevelopment Agreement, it shall not be deemed to be
in default if it shall have cured such default within thirty (30) days of its
receipt of a notice from a Non-defaulting Party specifying the nature of the
default, provided, however, with respect to those nonmonetary defaults
which are not capable of being cured within such thirty 
(30) day period, it shall not be deemed to be in default if it commences curing
within such thirty (30) day period, and thereafter diligently and continuously
prosecutes the cure of such default until the same has been cured.
 
M.   TIME; FORCE MAJEURE
 
For this Agreement, time is of the essence. However, the Developer and the City shall not be deemed
in default with respect to any obligations of this Agreement on its part to be
performed if the Developer
or City fails to timely perform the same and such failure is due in whole, or in part, to any strike, lock-
out, labor trouble (whether legal or illegal), civil disorder, inability to
procure materials, weather conditions wet soil conditions, failure or
interruptions of power, restrictive governmental laws and
regulations, condemnation, riots, insurrections, war, fuel shortages, accidents, casualties, Acts of God,
acts caused directly or indirectly by the City (or the City’s agents, employees
or invitees) when applicable to Developer or third parties, or any other cause
beyond the reasonable control of Developer or the City.
 
N.   ASSIGNMENT
 
The rights (including, but not limited to, the right to payments contemplated
by Section C of this Agreement) and obligations (or either of them) of the
Developer under this Agreement shall be fully assignable by the Developer
provided written notice is provided to the City and the City’s consent is
obtained prior to such assignment. The City’s consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld provided that the nature of the Project is not substantially changed,
and further provided that the assignee is financially
capable of fulfilling the obligations of the assignor. Any such assignment shall be subject to all the
terms
 
and conditions contained in this Agreement. Further, no such assignment shall be deemed to release
the assignor of its obligations to the City under this Agreement unless the
consent of the City to the release of the assignor’s obligations is first
obtained.
 
O.   PREPAYMENTS

of the City and its
citizens, and to prevent the spread of blight and deterioration and inadequate public facilities, including
sanitary sewer, by promoting the development of private investment in the
marketability of property thereby increasing the tax base of the City and
providing employment for its citizens; and
WHEREAS, Pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/8-1-2.5, a municipality may appropriate and
expend funds for economic development purposes, including without limitation
for commercial enterprises that are
deemed necessary or desirable for the promotion of economic development within the community; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 ILCS 5/
11-74.4 et seq., as amended (the “Act”), the City has the authority to provide
incentives to owners or prospective owners of real property to redevelop,
rehabilitate and/or upgrade such property by reimbursing the
owner for certain costs from resulting increases in real estate tax revenues 
(“real estate tax increment”) or from other City revenues; and
WHEREAS, on February 24, 2020, recognizing the need to foster the development,
expansion and revitalization of certain properties which are vacant,
underutilized or obsolete or a combination thereof, the City approved a Tax
Increment Financing Redevelopment Plan and Projects (the “Plan”), designated a
Redevelopment Area and adopted Tax Increment Financing as provided under the
Act for the Marion Residential TIF District I (the “TIF District ”); and
WHEREAS, included in the Redevelopment Project Area is property which is owned
by the Developer, located at 302 S. Liberty Street, Marion, Illinois, real
estate tax property identification number 06-24-233-002 (the “Property”); and
WHEREAS, the Developer owns said Property and is proceeding with plans to
construct a new residential home located thereon (the “Project”), and is doing
so based on the availability of TIF incentives offered by the City; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the City to encourage economic development which
will increase the real estate tax revenue of the City, which increased
incremental taxes will be used, in part, to finance incentives to assist
development within the Tax Increment Financing District; and
WHEREAS, the Developer’s proposed Project is consistent with the TIF District
Redevelopment Plan
 
and Projects for the Redevelopment Project Area and further conforms to the land uses of the City as
adopted; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-4(b) of the Act, the City may make and

requested as set forth
herein and that said Project will, as a part of the Plan, promote the health, safety and welfare of the City
and its citizens by attracting private investment to prevent blight and
deterioration and to generally enhance the economy of the City; and
WHEREAS, the City has reviewed the conditions of the Property and has reason to believe that the
costs of the necessary public and private improvements to be incurred by the Developer in furtherance
of the Project are eligible project costs under the Act and are consistent with the Redevelopment Plan
of the City; and
 
WHEREAS, 
the Parties have agreed that the City shall reimburse the Developer Sixty percent

AGREEMENTS
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt
of which is acknowledged, agree as follows:
 
A.   PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS
 
1.   The Parties agree that the matters set forth in the recitals above are
true and correct and form a part of this Agreement.
 
2.   Any terms which are not defined
in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as they do in the Act, unless
indicated to the contrary.
 
3.   The Developer shall remain in compliance with all municipal ordinances
relating to property development, property condition, zoning, subdivision and
building codes. Failure to cure the violation of any such ordinance within
thirty (30) days upon being provided written notice of the
same by the City shall be cause for th City to declare the Developer in Default and unilaterally
terminate this Agreement, except where such failure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within
such 30-day period, in which case the Developer shall have such additional time
to cure as is reasonably necessary, provided that the Developer has commenced
such cure within such 30-day period and continues to diligently prosecute the
same to completion.
 
4.   The Developer shall complete the Project within twelve (12) months from
the date this Agreement is executed, subject to extension due to Force Majeure
(defined below).
 
5.   Each of the Parties represents that it has taken all actions necessary to
authorize its representatives to execute this Agreement.
 
B.   ADOPTION OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING
 
The City has created a Tax Increment Financing District known as the “Marion
Residential TIF District I” which includes the Developer’s Property. The City
has approved certain Redevelopment Project Costs, including the types described
in Exhibit “1"  for the Developer’s Project.
 
C.   INCENTIVES
 
In consideration for the Developer completing the Project as set forth herein, the City agrees to extend
to the Developer the following incentives to assist the Developer’s Project:
 
1.   The City shall reimburse the Developer Sixty percent (60%) of the annual
“net” incremental increase in real estate tax generated over the base year by
the Developer’s Project for the
reimbursement of the Developer’s Eligible Project Costs 
(Exhibit “1"). Said reimbursements
shall commence with the real estate tax increment derived from the real estate taxes assessed in
year 2026 and paid in 2027, and continue for the current remaining life of the
TIF District, which is tax year 2043 with final payment received in 2044, or
until all TIF eligible project costs as
described in Exhibit “1" are fully reimbursed, not to exceed a total of Thirty Thousand Five
Hundred Dollars and No Cents 
($30,500.00), whichever occurs first. These funds are to be allocated to and
when collected shall be paid to the City Treasurer for deposit in a separate
account within the Special Tax Allocation Fund for the Marion Residential TIF District I
 
designated as the “Franks - 302 S. Liberty Project Special Account” (the
“Special Account”). All monies deposited into the Special Account shall be used
exclusively by the City for the purposes set forth in this Agreement.
 
2.   “Net” real estate tax increment is defined as increases in annual real estate tax increment derived
from the Developer’s Project after payment of the proportionate amount of administrative fees
and costs incurred by the City and payments pursuant to TIF District
Intergovernmental Agreements, if any. The Developer’s proportionate amount is
calculated by dividing the increment generated by the Developer’s Project by
the total TIF District increment.
 
D.   LIMITATION OF INCENTIVES TO DEVELOPER
 
1.   The Developer shall be reimbursed by the City for all TIF Eligible Project
Costs permitted by the Act (subject to a limitation of $30,500.00) and as set
forth in Exhibit “1" from the real estate
tax increment generated by this Project located on the Property and deposited into the Special
Account, but only for the term of the Agreement and only from the Property
included in this Project and currently owned by the Developer at that location.
 
2.   It is not contemplated nor is the City obligated to use any of its
proportionate share of the
monies for any of the Developer’s Eligible Project Costs but, rather, the City shall use its sums
for any purpose under the Act as it may in its sole discretion determine.
 
3.   The Developer agrees to substantially complete the project, subject to
Force Majeure, as defined below.
 
E.   PAYMENT OF ELIGIBLE PROJECT COSTS
 
1.   Payment to the Developer for TIF Eligible Project Costs as set forth by the Act, shall be made
by a Requisition for Payment of Private Development Redevelopment Costs
(Exhibit “2", “Requisition”) submitted from time to time by the Developer to
the City’s TIF Administrator Jacob & Klein, Ltd., with copy to The Economic
Development Group, Ltd. (collectively, the
“Administrator”), and subject to the Administrator’s approval of the costs and to the availability
of funds in the Special Account.
 
2.   All Requisitions must be accompanied by verified bills or statements of
suppliers, contractors or professionals together with mechanic’s lien waivers
(whether partial or full) from each of the parties entitled to a payment that
is the subject of the Requisition as required by the City.
 
3.   In order for the Developer to receive reimbursement of Eligible Project
Costs for costs it has incurred in any year as set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2
above, the Developer must submit such
proposed eligible costs to the City by March 1 of the following year. If there are no accumulated
outstanding costs previously submitted and approved by the City and if the Developer does not
submit such proposed eligible costs by this deadline, the Developer will forfeit reimbursement
of such costs from the prior year’s real estate tax increment to be paid in the current year. Any
approved eligible costs submitted after this deadline will be eligible for reimbursement from the
next year’s real estate increment receipts.
 
4.   Any real estate increment not required to be paid to the Developer under the terms of Paragraph
3 above shall be available to the City for
any purpose set forth in the TIF Plan and allowed by
 
the Act.
 
5.   The Developer shall use such sums as reimbursement for Eligible Project
Costs only to the
extent permitted by law and the Act and may allocate such funds for any purpose for the terms
of this Agreement or the term of the TIF District whichever is longer.
 
6.   The Administrator shall approve or disapprove a Requisition by written
receipt to the Developer within thirty 
(30) business days after receipt of the Requisition. Approval of the Requisition will
not be unreasonably withheld. If a Requisition is disapproved by the Administrator the reasons
for disallowance will be set forth in writing and the Developer may resubmit
the Requisition with
such additional information as may be required and the same procedures set forth herein shall
apply to such re-submittals.
 
7.   All TIF Eligible Project Costs approved shall then be paid by the City from the Special Account
to the Developer, or to others as directed by the Developer, pursuant to the
Redevelopment Plan and as allowed by Illinois Law. The City shall pay such
approved eligible Costs annually, provided the Developer has satisfied the
terms of this Agreement and costs which exceed the
amount available to pay the Developer shall carry forward, until paid, without further action of
the Developer. Payment shall be made within forty-five 
(45) days after approval subject to the terms if this Agreement and after
receipt of the increment generated by the Developer’s Redevelopment Project
from the County.
 
8.   The Parties acknowledge that the determination of Eligible Project Costs,
and, therefore, qualification for reimbursement hereunder are subject to
changes or interpretation made by amendments to the Act, administrative rules
or judicial interpretation during the term of this
Agreement. The City has no obligation to the Developer to attempt to modify those decisions
but will assist the Developer in every respect as to obtaining approval of Eligible Project Costs.
 
F.   VERIFICATION OF TAX INCREMENT
 
1.   It shall be the sole responsibility of the Developer or its designee to
provide to the City, as requested in writing, copies of all PAID real estate
tax bills, annually, for the Property.
 
2.   The failure of Developer to provide any information required herein after written notice from
the City, and the continued failure to provide such information within (30)
days after such notice,
shall be considered a breach of this Agreement and shall be cause for the City to deny payments
hereunder to the Developer, which payments are conditional upon receipt of the
foregoing information.
 
G.   REIMBURSEMENT OF THE DEVELOPER’S SHARE OF TAX OBJECTION REFUNDS
 
If a refund of tax increment 
(including any accrued statutory interest thereon) is potentially due from the
City’s TIF Fund as the result of any tax objection, assessment challenge or
formal appeal to the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB), issuance of a
certificate of error or other such action,
including any appeals therefrom, concerning the potential reduction of assessed value of the Property,
the City may at its sole discretion withhold the Developer’s share of any such
possible refund (including any accrued statutory interest thereon) from future
reimbursements calculated to be paid to the
Developer under this Agreement. Furthermore, the Developer is hereby obligated to provide written
 
notice to the City within five (5) days of filing any such objection,
assessment challenge or formal appeal to the PTAB or other such action,
including any appeals therefrom, that could potentially reduce the assessed
value of the Property. Failure to provide such notice shall be considered a
breach of this Agreement and shall be cause for the City to deny payments
hereunder to the Developer.
 
Any funds withheld by the City under this Section G shall be deposited by it
into a separate interest bearing bank account. Upon final determination of the
assessed value of the Property, the City shall
pay to the Developer the principal amount due under this Agreement as recalculated. The City shall be
entitled to retain any interest earned on the account as partial payment for
the administration of the
account due to the delay of the determination of the final evaluation and recalculation of the benefits
due the Developer under this Agreement.
 
If it appears to the City that it will be unable to recover the Developer’s
share of any such refund
(including any accrued statutory interest thereon) from the remaining future
reimbursements due the Developer under this Agreement, the Developer shall
reimburse the City for the Developer’s remaining
unpaid share of such refund within thirty 
(30) days upon receiving written demand of the same from the City.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations contained in this Section G shall remain in effect for the
remaining life of the TIF District, whether the TIF District
expires upon the current expiration of the Redevelopment Plan and Projects adopted by the City 
(tax
year 2043 payable 2044); at an earlier time if the City passes an ordinance terminating the TIF District;
or at a later time if the TIF District is legislatively extended. Furthermore, the obligations set forth in
this Section G shall survive the expiration of the TIF District if a tax
objection or other such action taken by the Developer is pending prior to the
expiration of the TIF District and shall continue until final disposition of
such action.
 
H.   LIMITED OBLIGATION
 
The City’s obligation hereunder to pay the Developer for Eligible Project Costs is a limited obligation
to be paid solely from the Special Account. Said obligation does not now and shall never constitute an
indebtedness of the City within the meaning of any State of Illinois
constitutional or statutory provision
and shall not constitute or give rise to a pecuniary liability of the City or a charge or lien against any City
fund or require the City to utilize its taxing authority to fulfill the terms
of this Agreement.
 
I.   CITY PUBLIC PROJECTS
 
The City intends to use part or all of its share of the Project’s real estate
increment for other public projects within the TIF District or within
contiguous TIF Districts as allowed by law. The City shall
be eligible for reimbursement of the cost of doing so, as well as other eligible costs incurred by the City
in the TIF District.
 
J.   LIMITED LIABILITY OF CITY TO OTHERS FOR DEVELOPER'S EXPENSES
 
There shall be no obligation by the City to make any payments to any person other than the Developer,
nor shall the City be obligated to make direct payments to any other
contractor, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman providing services or
materials to the Developer for the Developer’s Project.
 
K.   COOPERATION OF THE PARTIES
 
1.   The City and the Developer agree to cooperate fully with each other when
requested to do so
concerning the development of the Developer’s Redevelopment Project. This includes without
limitation the City assisting or sponsoring the Developer, or agreeing to
jointly apply with the Developer, for any grant, award, subsidy or additional
funding which may be available from other governmental sources as the result of
the Developer’s or City’s activities. This also includes without limitation the
Developer assisting or sponsoring the City, or agreeing to jointly apply
with the City, for any grant, award, or subsidy which may be available as the result of the City’s
or the Developer’s activities.
 
2.   The Parties agree to take such actions, including the execution and delivery of such documents,
instruments, petitions, and certifications (and, in the City’s case, the
adoption of such ordinances
and resolutions), as may be necessary or appropriate, from time to time, to carry out the terms,
provisions, and intent of this Agreement and to aid and assist each other in
carrying out said terms, provisions, and intent.
 
3.   The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other in seeking from any or
all appropriate governmental bodies all approvals 
(whether federal, state, county or local) required or useful for the
construction or improvement of property and facilities in and on the Property
or for the provision of services to the Property, including, without
limitation, wetland mitigation, gas,
telephone, and electric utility services, roads, highways, rights-of-
way, water and sanitary sewage facilities, and storm water disposal facilities.
 
L.   DEFAULT; CURE; REMEDIES
 
In the event of a default under this Redevelopment Agreement by any party
hereto (the “Defaulting
Party”), which default is not cured within the cure period provided for below, then the other Party 
(the “Non-defaulting Party”), may have an action for damages, or, in the event
damages would not fairly compensate the Non-defaulting Parties for the
Defaulting Party’s breach of this Redevelopment Agreement, the Non-
defaulting Party shall have such other equity rights and remedies as are available
to them at law or in equity. Any damages payable by the City hereunder shall be
limited to the real estate tax increment payable to the Developer under the
terms of this Agreement.
 
In the event a Defaulting Party shall fail to perform a monetary covenant which
it is required to perform under this Redevelopment Agreement, it shall not be
deemed to be in default under this Redevelopment
Agreement unless it shall have failed to perform such monetary covenant within thirty 
(30) days of its receipt of a notice from a Non-
defaulting Party specifying that it has failed to perform such monetary
covenant. In the event a Defaulting Party fails to perform any nonmonetary
covenant as and when it is required to under this Redevelopment Agreement,
it shall not be deemed to be in default if it shall have cured such default
within thirty (30) days of its receipt of a notice from a Non-defaulting Party
specifying the nature of the default, provided, however, with respect to those
nonmonetary defaults which are not capable of being cured within such thirty 
(30) day period, it shall not be deemed to be in default if it commences curing
within such thirty (30) day period, and thereafter diligently and continuously
prosecutes the cure of such default until the same has been cured.
 
M.   TIME; FORCE MAJEURE
 
For this Agreement, time is of the essence. The Developer agrees to complete the Project within
twelve
(12) months following the date of execution of this Agreement. Failure to do so shall be cause for the
City to declare the Developer in default and unilaterally terminate this
Agreement. However, the Developer and the City shall not be deemed in default
with respect to any obligations of this Agreement
on its part to be performed if the Developer or City fails to timely perform the same and such failure
is due in whole, or in part, to any strike, lock-out, labor trouble 
(whether legal or illegal), civil disorder,
inability to procure materials, weather conditions wet soil conditions, failure or interruptions of power,
restrictive governmental laws and regulations, condemnation, riots, insurrections, war, fuel shortages,
accidents, casualties, Acts of God, acts caused directly or indirectly by the
City (or the City’s agents, employees or invitees) when applicable to Developer
or third parties, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Developer
or the City.
 
N.   ASSIGNMENT
 
The rights (including, but not limited to, the right to payments contemplated
by Section C of this Agreement) and obligations (or either of them) of the
Developer under this Agreement shall be fully assignable by the Developer
provided written notice is provided to the City and the City’s consent is
obtained prior to such assignment. The City’s consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld provided that the nature of the Project is not substantially changed,
and further provided that the assignee is financially capable of fulfilling the
obligations of the assignor. Any such assignment shall be subject to all the
terms
and conditions contained in this Agreement. Further, no such assignment shall be deemed to release
the assignor of its obligations to the City under this Agreement unless the
consent of the City to the release of the assignor’s obligations is first
obtained.
 
O.   PREPAYMENTS
 
Should the annual incremental tax revenue generated by the Project be sufficient to pay all cost eligible
expenses prior to the expiration of the term of the Agreement, the City may, in its sole discretion, elect
to pay all then remaining payments in a single lump sum payment.
 
P.   WAIVER
 
Any party to this Agreement may elect to waive any remedy it may enjoy hereunder, provided that no
such waiver shall be deemed to exist unless the party waiving such right of remedy does so in writing.
No such waiver shall obligate such party to waive any right of remedy
hereunder, or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of other rights and
remedies provided said party pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Q.   SEVERABILITY
 
If any section, subsection, term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any party
or circumstance shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of said section,
subsection, term or provision of this Agreement or the application of same to parties or circumstances
other than those to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be
affected thereby.
 
R.   NOTICES
 
All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or other instruments required or permitted by

Agreement shall be in writing and shall be executed by the party or an officer, agent or attorney of the

AGREEMENTS
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt
of which is acknowledged, agree as follows:
 
A.   PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS
 
1.   The Parties agree that the matters set forth in the recitals above are
true and correct and form a part of this Agreement.
 
2.   Any terms which are not defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning as they do in
the Act, unless indicated to the contrary.
 
3.   The Developer shall remain in compliance with all municipal ordinances
relating to property development, property condition, zoning, subdivision and
building codes. Failure to cure the violation of any such ordinance within
thirty (30) days upon being provided written notice of the
same by the City shall be cause for th City to declare the Developer in Default and unilaterally
terminate this Agreement, except where such failure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within
such 30-day period, in which case the Developer shall have such additional time
to cure as is reasonably necessary, provided that the Developer has commenced
such cure within such 30-day period and continues to diligently prosecute the
same to completion.
 
4.   The Developer shall complete the Project within eighteen (18) months from
the date this Agreement is executed, subject to extension due to Force Majeure
(defined below).
 
5.   Each of the Parties represents that it has taken all actions necessary to
authorize its representatives to execute this Agreement.
 
B.   ADOPTION OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING
 
The City has created a Tax Increment Financing District known as the “Marion
Hub TIF District” which includes the Developer’s Property. The City has
approved certain Redevelopment Project Costs, including the types described in
Exhibit “1" for the Developer’s Project which shall be hereafter known as the
“The Art House, LLC Redevelopment Project.”
C.   INCENTIVES
 
In consideration for the Developer purchasing the Property and timely
completing the Project as set forth herein, the City agrees to extend to the
Developer the following incentives to assist the Developer’s Project:
 
1.   The City shall reimburse the Developer Sixty percent (60%) of the annual
“net” incremental increase in real estate tax generated over the base year by
the Developer’s Project for the
reimbursement of the Developer’s Eligible Project Costs 
(Exhibit “1"). Said reimbursements
shall commence with the real estate tax increment derived from the real estate taxes assessed in
year 2026 and paid in 2027, and continue for the current remaining life of the
TIF District
including any legislative extensions thereof, or until all TIF eligible project costs as described in
Exhibit “1" are fully reimbursed, not to exceed a total of Two Hundred Fifty-
Eight Thousand Five Hundred Dollars and No Cents ($258,500.00), whichever
occurs first. These
funds are to be allocated to and when collected shall be paid to the City Treasurer for deposit in
a separate account within the Special Tax Allocation Fund for the Marion Hub
TIF District designated as the “The Art House, LLC Special Account” (the
“Special Account”). All
monies deposited into the Special Account shall be used exclusively by the City for the purposes
set forth in this Agreement.
 
2.   “Net” real estate tax increment is defined as increases in annual real estate tax increment derived
from the Developer’s Project after payment of the proportionate amount of administrative fees
and costs incurred by the City and payments pursuant to TIF District
Intergovernmental
Agreements, if any.  The Developer’s proportionate amount is calculated by dividing the
 
increment generated by the Developer’s Project by the total TIF District
increment.
 
3.   In order to continue receiving the incentives set forth herein, the
developer agrees to provide any
information to the City upon written request of the City regarding the number of jobs created
and/or retained by the Project as may be required by the Act and/
or by the Illinois Comptroller.
Failure to provide such information within 30 days from the date of the City’s request shall be
cause for the City, at the City’s sole discretion, to declare the Developer in
default and/or for the City to withhold any payments otherwise due the
Developer hereunder until such time as the City’s request is satisfied.
 
4.   In the event the Developer sells or otherwise conveys all or any part of the Property during the
term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be terminable by the City in its
own discretion upon written notice by the City to the Developer.
 
D.   LIMITATION OF INCENTIVES TO DEVELOPER
 
1.   The Developer shall be reimbursed by the City for all Eligible Project
Costs permitted by the Act (subject to a limitation of $258,500.00) from the
real estate tax increment generated by this Project located on the Property and
deposited into the Special Account, but only for the term of
the Agreement and only from the Property included in this Project and currently owned
by the Developer at that location.
 
2.   It is not contemplated nor is the City obligated to use any of its
proportionate share of the
monies for any of the Developer’s Eligible Project Costs but, rather, the City shall use its sums
for any purpose under the Act as it may in its sole discretion determine.
 
3.   The Developer agrees to timely complete the project, subject to Force
Majeure, as defined below.
 
E.   PAYMENT OF ELIGIBLE PROJECT COSTS
 
1.   Payment to the Developer for TIF Eligible Project Costs as set forth by the Act, shall be made
by a Requisition for Payment of Private Development Redevelopment Costs
(Exhibit “2", “Requisition”) submitted from time to time by the Developer to
the City’s TIF Administrator Jacob & Klein, Ltd., with copy to The Economic
Development Group, Ltd. (collectively, the
“Administrator”), and subject to the Administrator’s approval of the costs and to the availability
of funds in the Special Account.
 
2.   All Requisitions must be accompanied by verified bills or statements of
suppliers, contractors or professionals together with mechanic’s lien waivers
(whether partial or full) from each of the parties entitled to a payment that
is the subject of the Requisition as required by the City.
 
3.   In order for the Developer to receive reimbursement of Eligible Project
Costs for costs it has incurred in any year as set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2
above, the Developer must submit such
proposed eligible costs to the City by March 1 of the following year. If there are no accumulated
outstanding costs previously submitted and approved by the City and if the Developer does not
submit such proposed eligible costs by this deadline, the Developer will forfeit reimbursement
of such costs from the prior year’s real estate tax increment to be paid in the current year. Any
approved eligible costs submitted after this deadline will be eligible for reimbursement from the
next year’s real estate increment receipts.
 
4.   Any real estate increment not required to be paid to the Developer under the terms of Paragraph
3 above shall be available to the City for
any purpose set forth in the TIF Plan and allowed by the Act.
 
5.   The Developer shall use such sums as reimbursement for Eligible Project
Costs only to the
extent permitted by law and the Act and may allocate such funds for any purpose for the terms
of this Agreement or the term of the TIF District whichever is longer.
 
6.   The Administrator shall approve or disapprove a Requisition by written
receipt to the Developer within thirty 
(30) business days after receipt of the Requisition. Approval of the Requisition will
not be unreasonably withheld. If a Requisition is disapproved by the Administrator the reasons
for disallowance will be set forth in writing and the Developer may resubmit
the Requisition with
such additional information as may be required and the same procedures set forth herein shall
apply to such re-submittals.
 
7.   All TIF Eligible Project Costs approved shall then be paid by the City from the Special Account
to the Developer, or to others as directed by the Developer, pursuant to the
Redevelopment Plan and as allowed by Illinois Law. The City shall pay such
approved eligible Costs annually, provided the Developer has satisfied the
terms of this Agreement and costs which exceed the
amount available to pay the Developer shall carry forward, until paid, without further action of
the Developer. Payment shall be made within forty-five 
(45) days after approval subject to the terms if this Agreement and after
receipt of the increment generated by the Developer’s Redevelopment Project
from the County.
 
8.   The Parties acknowledge that the determination of Eligible Project Costs,
and, therefore, qualification for reimbursement hereunder are subject to
changes or interpretation made by amendments to the Act, administrative rules
or judicial interpretation during the term of this
Agreement. The City has no obligation to the Developer to attempt to modify those decisions
but will assist the Developer in every respect as to obtaining approval of Eligible Project Costs.
 
F.   VERIFICATION OF TAX INCREMENT
 
1.   It shall be the sole responsibility of the Developer or its designee to
provide to the City, as requested in writing, copies of all PAID real estate
tax bills, annually, for the Property.
 
2.   The failure of Developer to provide any information required herein after written notice from
the City, and the continued failure to provide such information within (30)
days after such notice,
shall be considered a breach of this Agreement and shall be cause for the City to deny payments
hereunder to the Developer, which payments are conditional upon receipt of the
foregoing information.
 
G.   REIMBURSEMENT OF THE DEVELOPER’S SHARE OF TAX OBJECTION REFUNDS
 
If a refund of tax increment 
(including any accrued statutory interest thereon) is potentially due from the
City’s TIF Fund as the result of any tax objection, assessment challenge or
formal appeal to the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB), issuance of a
certificate of error or other such action,
including any appeals therefrom, concerning the potential reduction of assessed value of the Property,
 
the City may at its sole discretion withhold the Developer’s share of any such
possible refund (including any accrued statutory interest thereon) from future
reimbursements calculated to be paid to the
Developer under this Agreement. Furthermore, the Developer is hereby obligated to provide written
notice to the City within five (5) days of filing any such objection,
assessment challenge or formal appeal to the PTAB or other such action,
including any appeals therefrom, that could potentially reduce the assessed
value of the Property. Failure to provide such notice shall be considered a
breach of this Agreement and shall be cause for the City to deny payments
hereunder to the Developer.
 
Any funds withheld by the City under this Section G shall be deposited by it
into a separate interest bearing bank account. Upon final determination of the
assessed value of the Property, the City shall
pay to the Developer the principal amount due under this Agreement as recalculated. The City shall be
entitled to retain any interest earned on the account as partial payment for
the administration of the
account due to the delay of the determination of the final evaluation and recalculation of the benefits
due the Developer under this Agreement.
 
If it appears to the City that it will be unable to recover the Developer’s
share of any such refund
(including any accrued statutory interest thereon) from the remaining future reimbursements due the
Developer under this Agreement, the Developer shall reimburse the City for the
Developer’s remaining unpaid share of such refund within thirty 
(30) days upon receiving written demand of the same from the City.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations contained in this Section G shall remain in effect for the
remaining life of the TIF District, whether the TIF District
expires upon the current expiration of the Redevelopment Plan and Projects adopted by the City 
(tax
year 2033 payable 2034); at an earlier time if the City passes an ordinance terminating the TIF District;
or at a later time if the TIF District is legislatively extended. Furthermore, the obligations set forth in
this Section G shall survive the expiration of the TIF District if a tax
objection or other such action taken by the Developer is pending prior to the
expiration of the TIF District and shall continue until final disposition of
such action.
 
H.   LIMITED OBLIGATION
 
The City’s obligation hereunder to pay the Developer for Eligible Project Costs is a limited obligation
to be paid solely from the Special Account. Said obligation does not now and shall never constitute an
indebtedness of the City within the meaning of any State of Illinois
constitutional or statutory provision
and shall not constitute or give rise to a pecuniary liability of the City or a charge or lien against any City
fund or require the City to utilize its taxing authority to fulfill the terms
of this Agreement.
 
I.   CITY PUBLIC PROJECTS
 
The City intends to use part or all of its share of the Project’s real estate
increment for other public projects within the TIF District or within
contiguous TIF Districts as allowed by law. The City shall
be eligible for reimbursement of the cost of doing so, as well as other eligible costs incurred by the City
in the TIF District.
 
J.   LIMITED LIABILITY OF CITY TO OTHERS FOR DEVELOPER'S EXPENSES
 
There shall be no obligation by the City to make any payments to any person other than the Developer,
nor shall the City be obligated to make direct payments to any other
contractor, subcontractor, mechanic
 
or materialman providing services or materials to the Developer for the Developer’s
Project.
 
K.   COOPERATION OF THE PARTIES
 
1.   The City and the Developer agree to cooperate fully with each other when
requested to do so
concerning the development of the Developer’s Redevelopment Project. This includes without
limitation the City assisting or sponsoring the Developer, or agreeing to
jointly apply with the Developer, for any grant, award, subsidy or additional
funding which may be available from other governmental sources as the result of
the Developer’s or City’s activities. This also includes without limitation the
Developer assisting or sponsoring the City, or agreeing to jointly apply
with the City, for any grant, award, or subsidy which may be available as the result of the City’s
or the Developer’s activities.
 
2.   The Parties agree to take such actions, including the execution and delivery of such documents,
instruments, petitions, and certifications (and, in the City’s case, the
adoption of such ordinances
and resolutions), as may be necessary or appropriate, from time to time, to carry out the terms,
provisions, and intent of this Agreement and to aid and assist each other in
carrying out said terms, provisions, and intent.
 
3.   The Parties shall cooperate fully with each other in seeking from any or
all appropriate governmental bodies all approvals 
(whether federal, state, county or local) required or useful for the
construction or improvement of property and facilities in and on the Property
or for the provision of services to the Property, including, without
limitation, wetland mitigation, gas,
telephone, and electric utility services, roads, highways, rights-of-
way, water and sanitary sewage facilities, and storm water disposal facilities.
 
L.   DEFAULT; CURE; REMEDIES
 
In the event of a default under this Redevelopment Agreement by any party
hereto (the “Defaulting
Party”), which default is not cured within the cure period provided for below, then the other Party 
(the “Non-defaulting Party”), may have an action for damages, or, in the event
damages would not fairly compensate the Non-defaulting Parties for the
Defaulting Party’s breach of this Redevelopment Agreement, the Non-
defaulting Party shall have such other equity rights and remedies as are available
to them at law or in equity. Any damages payable by the City hereunder shall be
limited to the real estate tax increment payable to the Developer under the
terms of this Agreement.
 
In the event a Defaulting Party shall fail to perform a monetary covenant which
it is required to perform under this Redevelopment Agreement, it shall not be
deemed to be in default under this Redevelopment
Agreement unless it shall have failed to perform such monetary covenant within thirty 
(30) days of its receipt of a notice from a Non-
defaulting Party specifying that it has failed to perform such monetary
covenant. In the event a Defaulting
Party fails to perform any nonmonetary covenant as and when it is required to
under this Redevelopment Agreement, it shall not be deemed to be in default if
it shall have cured such default within thirty (30) days of its receipt of a
notice from a Non-defaulting Party specifying the nature of the default,
provided, however, with respect to those nonmonetary defaults
which are not capable of being cured within such thirty 
(30) day period, it shall not be deemed to be in default if it commences curing
within such thirty (30) day period, and thereafter diligently and continuously
prosecutes the cure of such default until the same has been cured.
 
M.   TIME; FORCE MAJEURE
 
For this Agreement, time is of the essence. The Developer agrees to complete
this Project within eighteen 
(18) months following the date of execution of this Agreement. Failure to do so shall be cause
for the City to declare the Developer in default and unilaterally terminate
this Agreement. However, the Developer and the City shall not be deemed in
default with respect to any obligations of this Agreement on its part to be
performed if the Developer or City fails to timely perform the same and such
failure is due in whole, or in part, to any strike, lock-out, labor trouble
(whether legal or illegal), civil disorder, inability to procure materials,
weather conditions wet soil conditions, failure or interruptions of power,
restrictive governmental laws and regulations, condemnation, riots,
insurrections, war, fuel shortages, accidents, casualties, Acts of God, acts caused directly or indirectly
by the City 
(or the City’s agents, employees or invitees) when applicable to Developer or third parties,
or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Developer or the City.
 
N.   ASSIGNMENT
 
The rights (including, but not limited to, the right to payments contemplated
by Section C of this Agreement) and obligations (or either of them) of the
Developer under this Agreement shall be fully assignable by the Developer
provided written notice is provided to the City and the City’s consent is
obtained prior to such assignment. The City’s consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld provided that the nature of the Project is not substantially changed,
and further provided that the assignee is financially capable of fulfilling the
obligations of the assignor. Any such assignment shall be subject to all the
terms
and conditions contained in this Agreement. Further, no such assignment shall be deemed to release
the assignor of its obligations to the City under this Agreement unless the
consent of the City to the release of the assignor’s obligations is first
obtained.
 
O.   PREPAYMENTS
 
Should the annual incremental tax revenue generated by the Project be sufficient to pay all cost eligible
expenses prior to the expiration of the term of the Agreement, the City may, in its sole discretion, elect
to pay all then remaining payments in a single lump sum payment.
 
P.   WAIVER
 
Any party to this Agreement may elect to waive any remedy it may enjoy hereunder, provided that no
such waiver shall be deemed to exist unless the party waiving such right of remedy does so in writing.
No such waiver shall obligate such party to waive any right of remedy
hereunder, or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of other rights and
remedies provided said party pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Q.   SEVERABILITY
 
If any section, subsection, term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any party
or circumstance shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of said section,
subsection, term or provision of this Agreement or the application of same to parties or circumstances
other than those to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be
affected thereby.
 
R.   NOTICES
 
All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals or other instruments required or permitted by
this
 
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be executed by the party or an officer, agent or attorney of the
party, and shall be deemed to have been effective as of the date of actual
delivery, if delivered personally, or as of the third (3rd) day from and

harmless the City for any claim asserted against the City arising from the
Developer’s Project and/or this Agreement or any challenge to the eligibility

PREAMBLE
 
WHEREAS, the City has the authority to promote the health, safety and welfare
of the City and its
citizens, and to prevent the spread of blight and deterioration and inadequate public facilities, including
sanitary sewer, by promoting the development of private investment in the
marketability of property thereby increasing the tax base of the City and
providing employment for its citizens; and
WHEREAS, Pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/8-1-2.5, a municipality may appropriate and
expend funds for economic development purposes, including without limitation
for commercial enterprises that are deemed necessary or desirable for the
promotion of economic development within the community; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, 65 ILCS 5/
11-74.4 et seq., as amended (the “Act”), the City has the authority to provide
incentives to owners or prospective owners of real property to redevelop,
rehabilitate and/or upgrade such property by reimbursing the
owner for certain costs from resulting increases in real estate tax revenues 
(“real estate tax increment”) or from other City revenues; and
WHEREAS, on May 9, 2022, recognizing the need to foster the development,
expansion and revitalization of certain properties which are vacant,
underutilized or obsolete or a combination thereof, the City approved a Tax
Increment Financing Redevelopment Plan and Projects (the “Plan”), designated a
Redevelopment Area and adopted Tax Increment Financing as provided under the
Act for the Marion Residential TIF District II (the “TIF District ”); and
WHEREAS, included in the Redevelopment Project Area is property which is owned
by the
Developer, located at 1100 S. Duncan, Marion, Illinois, real estate tax property identification number
06-24-327-066 (the “Property”); and
WHEREAS, the Developer owns said Property and is proceeding with plans to
rehabilitate and renovate the residential building located thereon (the
“Project”), and is doing so based on the availability of TIF incentives offered
by the City; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the City to encourage economic development which
will increase the real estate tax revenue of the City, which increased
incremental taxes will be used, in part, to finance incentives to assist
development within the Tax Increment Financing District; and
WHEREAS, the Developer’s proposed Project is consistent with the TIF District
Redevelopment Plan
 
and Projects for the Redevelopment Project Area and further conforms to the land uses of the City as
adopted; and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-4(b) of the Act, the City may make and
enter into all
contracts with property owners, developers, tenants, overlapping taxing bodies, and others necessary
or incidental to the implementation and furtherance of the Redevelopment Plan;
and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5/11-74.4-4
(j) of the Act, the City may incur project redevelopment costs and reimburse
developers who incur redevelopment project costs authorized by a redevelopment
agreement and further defined in Section 5/11-74.4-3(q) of the Act, including
those Estimated TIF
Eligible Project Costs as herein listed in the attached Exhibit “1" 
of this Redevelopment Agreement; and
 
WHEREAS, the Developer requested that incentives for the development be
provided by the City from incremental increases in real estate taxes of the
City generated from its Project and the City agreed to such incentives; and
WHEREAS, the City has determined that this Project required the incentives
requested as set forth
herein and that said Project will, as a part of the Plan, promote the health, safety and welfare of the City
and its citizens by attracting private investment to prevent blight and
deterioration and to generally enhance the economy of the City; and
WHEREAS, the City has reviewed the conditions of the Property and has reason to believe that the
costs of the necessary public and private improvements to be incurred by the Developer in furtherance
of the Project are eligible project costs under the Act and are consistent with the Redevelopment Plan
of the City; and
WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed that the City shall reimburse the Developer
for a portion of its TIF Eligible Project Costs incurred in furtherance of the
Project as set forth in Section C below.
 
WHEREAS, in consideration of the execution of this Agreement, the Developer is
completing the Project as set forth in Exhibit “1" ; and
WHEREAS, 
the City is entering into this Agreement having encouraged and induced the Developer
to proceed with the Project located on said Property.
 
 
AGREEMENTS
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt
of which is acknowledged, agree as follows:
 
A.   PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS
 
1.   The Parties agree that the matters set forth in the recitals above are
true and correct and form a part of this Agreement.
 
2.   Any terms which are not defined in this Agreement shall have
the same meaning as they do in the Act, unless indicated to the contrary.
 
3.   The Developer shall remain in compliance with all municipal ordinances
relating to property development, property condition, zoning, subdivision and
building codes. Failure to cure the violation of any such ordinance within
thirty (30) days upon being provided written notice of the
same by the City shall be cause for th City to declare the Developer in
Default and unilaterally
terminate this Agreement, except where such failure is not reasonably susceptible to cure within
such 30-day period, in which case the Developer shall have such additional time
to cure as is reasonably necessary, provided that the Developer has commenced
such cure within such 30-day period and continues to diligently prosecute the
same to completion.
 
4.   Each of the Parties represents that it has taken all actions necessary to
authorize its representatives to execute this Agreement.
 
B.   ADOPTION OF TAX INCREMENT FINANCING
 
The City has created a Tax Increment Financing District known as the “Marion
Residential TIF District II” which includes the Developer’s Property. The City
has approved certain Redevelopment Project Costs, including the types described
in Exhibit “1"  for the Developer’s Project.
 
C.   INCENTIVES
 
In consideration for the Developer completing the Project as set forth herein, the City agrees to extend
to the Developer the following incentives to assist the Developer’s Project:
 
1.   The City shall reimburse the Developer Sixty Percent 
(60%) of the annual “net” incremental increase in real estate tax generated
over the base year by the Developer’s Project for the
reimbursement of the Developer’s Eligible Project Costs 
(Exhibit “1"). Said reimbursements
shall commence with the real estate tax increment derived from the real estate taxes assessed in
year 2025 and paid in 2026, and continue for the current remaining life of the
TIF District, which is tax year 2045 with final payment received in 2046, or
until all TIF eligible project costs as described in Exhibit “1" are fully
reimbursed, not to exceed a total of Thirty-Eight Thousand Dollars and No Cents
($38,000.00), whichever occurs first. These funds are to be allocated
to and when collected shall be paid to the City Treasurer for deposit in a separate account within
the Special Tax Allocation Fund for the Marion Residential TIF District II
designated as the “Ruth E Malone-1100 S. Duncan Trust Special Account” (the
“Special Account”). All
monies deposited into the Special Account shall be used exclusively by the City for the purposes
set forth in this Agreement.
 
2.   “Net” real estate tax increment is defined as increases in annual real estate tax increment derived
from the Developer’s Project after payment of the proportionate amount of administrative fees
and costs incurred by the City and payments pursuant to TIF District
Intergovernmental Agreements, if any. The Developer’s proportionate amount is
calculated by dividing the increment generated by the Developer’s Project by
the total TIF District increment, and multiplying the result by any such
administrative fees and costs and payments pursuant to any TIF District
Intergovernmental Agreements.
 
 
 
D.   LIMITATION OF INCENTIVES TO DEVELOPER
 
1.   The Developer shall be reimbursed by the City for all TIF Eligible Project
Costs permitted by the Act (subject to a limitation of $38,000.00) and as set
forth in Exhibit “1" from the real estate
tax increment generated by this Project located on the Property and deposited into the Special
Account, but only for the term of the Agreement and only from the Property
included in this Project and currently owned by the Developer at that location.
 
2.   It is not contemplated nor is the City obligated to use any of its
proportionate share of the
monies for any of the Developer’s Eligible Project Costs but, rather, the City shall use its sums
for any purpose under the Act as it may in its sole discretion determine.
E.   PAYMENT OF ELIGIBLE PROJECT COSTS
 
1.   Payment to the Developer for TIF Eligible Project Costs as set forth by the Act, shall be made
by a Requisition for Payment of Private Development Redevelopment Costs
(Exhibit “2", “Requisition”) submitted from time to time by the Developer to
the City’s TIF Administrator Jacob & Klein, Ltd., with copy to The Economic
Development Group, Ltd. (collectively, the
“Administrator”), and subject to the Administrator’s approval of the costs and to the availability
of funds in the Special Account.
 
2.   All Requisitions must be accompanied by verified bills or statements of
suppliers, contractors or professionals together with mechanic’s lien waivers
(whether partial or full), cancelled checks, or other proof of payment of such
bills from each of the parties entitled to a payment that is the subject of the
Requisition as required by the City.
3.   In order for the Developer to receive reimbursement of Eligible Project
Costs for costs it has incurred in any year as set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2
above, the Developer must submit such
proposed eligible costs to the City by March 1 of the following year. If there are no accumulated
outstanding costs previously submitted and approved by the City and if the Developer does not
submit such proposed eligible costs by this deadline, the Developer will forfeit reimbursement
of such costs from the prior year’s real estate tax increment to be paid in the current year. Any
approved eligible costs submitted after this deadline will be eligible for reimbursement from the
next year’s real estate increment receipts.
4.   Any real estate increment not required to be paid to the Developer under the terms of Paragraph
3 above shall be available to the City for any purpose set forth in the TIF Plan and allowed by
the Act.
5.   The Developer shall use such sums as reimbursement for Eligible Project
Costs only to the
extent permitted by law and the Act and may allocate such funds for any purpose for the terms
of this Agreement or the term of the TIF District whichever is longer.
6.   The Administrator shall approve or disapprove a Requisition by written
receipt to the Developer within thirty 
(30) business days after receipt of the Requisition. Approval of the Requisition will
not be unreasonably withheld. If a Requisition is disapproved by the Administrator the reasons
for disallowance will be set forth in writing and the Developer may resubmit
the Requisition with
such additional information as may be required and the same procedures set forth herein shall
apply to such re-submittals.
 
7.   All TIF Eligible Project Costs approved shall then be paid by the City from the Special Account
to the Developer, or to others as directed by the Developer, pursuant to the
Redevelopment Plan and as allowed by Illinois Law. The City shall pay such
approved eligible Costs annually, provided the Developer has satisfied the
terms of this Agreement and costs which exceed the
amount available to pay the Developer shall carry forward, until paid, without further action of
the Developer. Payment shall be made within forty-five 
(45) days after approval subject to the terms if this Agreement and after
receipt of the increment generated by the Developer’s Redevelopment Project
from the County.
 
8.   The Parties acknowledge that the determination of Eligible Project Costs,
and, therefore, qualification for reimbursement hereunder are subject to
changes or interpretation made by amendments to the Act, administrative rules
or judicial interpretation during the term of this
Agreement. The City has no obligation to the Developer to attempt to modify those decisions
but will assist the Developer in every respect as to obtaining approval of Eligible Project Costs.
 
F.   VERIFICATION OF TAX INCREMENT
 
1.   It shall be the sole responsibility of the Developer or its designee to
provide to the City, as requested in writing, copies of all PAID real estate
tax bills, annually, for the Property.
 
2.   The failure of Developer to provide any information required herein after written notice from
the City, and the continued failure to provide such information within (30)
days after such notice,
shall be considered a breach of this Agreement and shall be cause for the City to deny payments
hereunder to the Developer, which payments are conditional upon receipt of the
foregoing information.
 
G.   REIMBURSEMENT OF THE DEVELOPER’S SHARE OF TAX OBJECTION REFUNDS
 
If a refund of tax increment 
(including any accrued statutory interest thereon) is potentially due from the
TIF Fund as the result of any tax objection, assessment challenge or formal
appeal to the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB), issuance of a
certificate of error or other such action, including any appeals
therefrom, concerning the potential reduction of assessed value of the Property, the City
may at its sole discretion withhold the Developer’s share of any such possible
refund (including any
accrued statutory interest thereon) from future reimbursements calculated to be paid to the Developer
under this Agreement. Furthermore, the Developer is hereby obligated to provide written notice to the
City within five (5) days of filing any such objection, assessment challenge or
formal appeal to the PTAB
or other such action, including any appeals therefrom, that could potentially reduce the assessed value
of the Property. Failure to provide such notice shall be considered a breach of this Agreement and shall
be cause for the City to deny payments hereunder to the Developer.
 
Any funds withheld by the City under this Section G shall be deposited by it
into a separate interest bearing bank account. Upon final determination of the
assessed value of the Property, the City shall
pay to the Developer the principal amount due under this Agreement as recalculated. The City shall be
entitled to retain any interest earned on the account as partial payment for
the administration of the
account due to the delay of the determination of the final evaluation and recalculation of the benefits
due the Developer under this Agreement.
 
If it appears to the City that it will be unable to recover the Developer’s share of any such
refund
 
(including any accrued
statutory interest thereon) from the remaining future reimbursements due the
Developer under this Agreement, the Developer shall reimburse the City for the
Developer’s remaining unpaid share of such refund within thirty (30) days upon
receiving written demand of the same from the City.
 
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations contained in this Section G shall remain in effect for the
remaining life of the TIF District, whether the TIF District
expires upon the current expiration of the Redevelopment Plan and Projects adopted by the City 
(tax
year 2045 payable 2046); at an earlier time if the City passes an ordinance terminating the TIF District;
or at a later time if the TIF District is legislatively extended. Furthermore, the obligations set forth in
this Section G shall survive the expiration of the TIF District if a tax
objection or other such action taken by the Developer is pending prior to the
expiration of the TIF District and shall continue until final disposition of
such action.
 
H.   LIMITED OBLIGATION
 
The City’s obligation hereunder to pay the Developer for Eligible Project Costs is a limited obligation
to be paid solely from the Special Account. Said obligation does not now and shall never constitute an
indebtedness of the City within the meaning of any State of Illinois
constitutional or statutory provision
and shall not constitute or give rise to a pecuniary liability of the City or a charge or lien against any City

requested to do so
concerning the development of the Developer’s Redevelopment Project. This includes without
limitation the City assisting or sponsoring the Developer, or agreeing to
jointly apply with the Developer, for any grant, award, subsidy or additional
funding which may be available from other governmental sources as the result of
the Developer’s or City’s activities. This also includes without limitation the
Developer assisting or sponsoring the City, or agreeing to jointly apply

instruments, petitions, and certifications (and, in the City’s case, the
adoption of such ordinances
and resolutions), as may be necessary or appropriate, from time to time, to carry out the terms,
 
provisions, and intent of this Agreement and to aid and assist each other in
carrying out said terms, provisions, and intent.

L.   DEFAULT; CURE; REMEDIES
 
In the event of a default under this Redevelopment Agreement by any party
hereto (the “Defaulting
Party”), which default is not cured within the cure period provided for below, then the other Party 
(the “Non-defaulting Party”), may have an action for damages, or, in the event
damages would not fairly compensate the Non-defaulting Parties for the
Defaulting Party’s breach of this Redevelopment Agreement, the Non-
defaulting Party shall have such other equity rights and remedies as are available
to them at law or in equity. Any damages payable by the City hereunder shall be
limited to the real estate tax increment payable to the Developer under the
terms of this Agreement.
 
In the event a Defaulting Party shall fail to perform a monetary covenant which
it is required to perform under this Redevelopment Agreement, it shall not be
deemed to be in default under this Redevelopment
Agreement unless it shall have failed to perform such monetary covenant within thirty 
(30) days of its receipt of a notice from a Non-
defaulting Party specifying that it has failed to perform such monetary
covenant. In the event a Defaulting Party fails to perform
any nonmonetary covenant as and when it is required to under this Redevelopment
Agreement, it shall not be deemed to be in default if it shall have cured such
default within thirty (30) days of its receipt of a notice from a Non-
defaulting Party specifying the nature of the default, provided, however, with
respect to those nonmonetary defaults
which are not capable of being cured within such thirty 
(30) day period, it shall not be deemed to be in default if it commences curing
within such thirty (30) day period, and thereafter diligently and continuously
prosecutes the cure of such default until the same has been cured.
 
M.   TIME; FORCE MAJEURE
 
For this Agreement, time is of the essence. However, the Developer and the City shall not be deemed
in default with respect to any obligations of this Agreement on its part to be
performed if the Developer
or City fails to timely perform the same and such failure is due in whole, or in part, to any strike, lock-
out, labor trouble (whether legal or illegal), civil disorder, inability to
procure materials, weather conditions wet soil conditions, failure or
interruptions of power, restrictive governmental laws and
regulations, condemnation, riots, insurrections, war, fuel shortages, accidents, casualties, Acts of God,
acts caused directly or indirectly by the City (or the City’s agents, employees
or invitees) when applicable to Developer or third parties, or any other cause
beyond the reasonable control of Developer or the City.
 
N.   ASSIGNMENT
 
The rights (including, but not limited to, the right to payments contemplated
by Section C of this Agreement) and obligations (or either of them) of the
Developer under this Agreement shall be fully assignable by the Developer
provided written notice is provided to the City and the City’s consent is
 
obtained prior to such assignment. The City’s consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld provided that the nature of the Project is not substantially changed,
and further provided that the assignee is financially capable of fulfilling the
obligations of the assignor. Any such assignment shall be subject to all the
terms
and conditions contained in this Agreement. Further, no such assignment shall be deemed to release
the assignor of its obligations to the City under this Agreement unless the
consent of the City to the release of the assignor’s obligations is first
obtained.
 
O.   PREPAYMENTS
 
Should the annual incremental tax revenue generated by the Project be sufficient to pay all cost eligible
expenses prior to the expiration of the term of the Agreement, the City may, in its sole discretion, elect
to pay all then remaining payments in a single lump sum payment.
 
P.   WAIVER
 
Any party to this Agreement may elect to waive any remedy it may enjoy hereunder, provided that no
such waiver shall be deemed to exist unless the party waiving such right of remedy does so in writing.
No such waiver shall obligate such party to waive any right of remedy
hereunder, or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of other rights and
remedies provided said party pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Q.   SEVERABILITY
 
If any section, subsection, term or provision of this Agreement or the application thereof to any party

DEBT MANAGEMENT POLICY
SECTION:
3-3-1: Purpose
3-3-2: Annual Review
3-3-3: Periodic Reviews
3-3-4: Debt Limits
3-3-5: Debt Features And Structures
3-3-6: Short Term Debt
3-3-7: Long Term Debt
3-3-8: Financial Professional
3-3-9: Capital Leasing
3-3-10: Investment Of Bond Proceeds
3-3-11: Modifications Of Provisions
3-3-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for the issuance of
debt, including leases, financing of capital projects, infrastructure and other
projects deemed necessary by the city council. This policy will assist the city
council to:
   A.   Obtain financing only when necessary.
   B.   Reduce debt interest costs.
   C.   Take all practical precautions to avoid any financial decisions which
will negatively impact current credit ratings on future debt issues.
   D.   Secure and maintain the highest possible bond rating. (Ord. 3005, 10-
10-2011)
3-3-2: ANNUAL REVIEW:
During the preparation of the city's annual budget, the city council shall
perform the following tasks in relation to its debt:
   A.   Assess the benefits for financing of projects budgeted in the next
budget year.
   B.   Review outstanding debt for refunding (interest savings, eliminating
restrictive covenants, etc.) and/or consolidation.
   C.   Review compliance with applicable financing documents (including bond
ordinances, credit enhancement policies, continuing disclosure requirements,
etc.). (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-3: PERIODIC REVIEWS:
The city council or its designee, semiannually, shall review debt service
accounts to ensure they are maintained in accordance with their bond
ordinances. As conditions merit, the city council or its designee shall review
or identify outstanding debt issues for refunding for interest savings. (Ord.
3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-4: DEBT LIMITS:
As a home rule unit of government, the city is not subject to debt limits. It
has the ability to issue general obligation debt without limitation or
referendum. However, it is the intent of the city council to be prudent in its
issuance of debt. Debt repaid solely from collection of property taxes should
not exceed ten percent (10%) of the city's most recent equalized assessed
valuation. However, this does not apply to general obligation bonds issued by
the city that it intends to repay from sources other than property taxes. If
less than one hundred percent (100%) of the annual debt service associated with
any bond is to be paid from property taxes, the amount of property taxes
extended shall be discounted at the bond interest rate(s) to determine the bond
par amount to be considered general obligation debt for purposes of its self-
imposed debt limit (this calculation is not required if the bond's principal
amounts are identified and the corresponding debt service is equal to the
property tax levied). Debt intended to be repaid from sources other than
property taxes are excluded from this section, whether or not it is issued as
general obligation debt. On an annual basis, prior to abating the current
property tax levy associated with such general obligation bonds, the city
council shall identify and designate the funds to be used for the payment of
such bonds. (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-5: DEBT FEATURES AND STRUCTURES:
Debt may be issued on the basis of: a) fixed or variable rate; b) taxable or
tax exempt; c) rated or nonrated; d) bank qualified or nonbank qualified; e)
credit enhanced or noncredit enhanced; f) term or serial maturities, including
balloon payments; g) callable and noncallable; h) private placements; and i)
restrictive covenants as required. Credit enhancement and ratings should be
used where applicable and there is cost benefit based on interest rate savings.
Long term debt should be callable with the earliest possible call feature that
does not impact the overall interest rate. The recommended maximum call feature
is a ten (10) year par call. Variable rate debt should be considered when
interest rates are expected to decline or remain flat. When possible, debt
should be issued as bank qualified. This section is not all encompassing and is
not intended to limit the city's debt structures. (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-6: SHORT TERM DEBT:
For purposes of this policy, "short term debt" is defined as any debt incurred
whose final maturity is five (5) years or less. Short term debt may be used to
purchase equipment and for other purposes deemed necessary by the city council,
including the refunding of debt, as long as the purpose is not prohibited by
state statute. Short term debt issued for operating/cash flow purposes should
mature within the time frame in which the proceeds will be spent, but no longer
than one year after such time. (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-7: LONG TERM DEBT:
For purposes of this policy, "long term debt" is defined as any debt incurred
whose final maturity is greater than five (5) years. Long term debt may be used
for the purchase of equipment, capital projects and/or any other purpose deemed
necessary by the city council (other than for operating purposes), including
refunding of debt, as long as the purpose is not prohibited by state statute.
Financing terms shall not exceed the useful life of the projects financed. Debt
issues should not exceed forty (40) years. When issuing long term debt, the
city council should consider the following debt types:
   A.   Alternate revenue debt obligations or general obligations debt to be
repaid from sources other than property taxes. These obligations require the
expected revenues to sufficiently meet debt service requirements for the life
of these obligations.
   B.   General revenue debt obligations to be repaid from property taxes. This
obligation is payable from a direct property tax levied and collected within
the city.
   C.   Private activity obligations. These obligations may be issued by the
city for the behalf of the issuer that provide special financing benefits to
qualified projects. These obligations are subject to internal revenue service
requirements and state volume caps to preserve tax exemption. The cost of
issuance of private activity obligations is usually higher than for
governmental purpose obligations. Typically, the city has no obligation to pay
debt service for private activity obligations; they are not a liability of the
city and do not count as city debt. They should be used to promote economic
development within the city.
   D.   Special service area and special assessment obligations. These
obligations may be issued by the city for the designated taxpayers receiving
the benefit. The taxpayers within the designated area are responsible for the
payment of debt service on such obligations and can be paid from property taxes
or a special assessment within the designated area. These obligations are
typically issued in response to property owners within the designated area
requesting infrastructure/utilities improvements. These obligations are not a
liability of the city and are not considered city debt. Alternate revenue debt
obligations or general obligations debt are to be repaid from sources other
than property taxes. These obligations require the expected revenues to
sufficiently meet debt service requirements for the life of these obligations.
   E.   Tax increment financing obligations. These obligations are used to
promote economic development within a designated tax increment finance
district. They are repaid from the incremental property taxes generated within
the district. Unless backed by the city, such obligations are not a liability
of the city and are not considered a city debt. (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-8: FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL:
When deemed necessary by the city council, it shall seek advice from a
financial professional. The financial professional to be used by the city
should have experience with debt structuring (including type and length) and
working with bond rating services and other services deemed necessary by the
city council. (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-9: CAPITAL LEASING:
Capital leasing, when offered, is an option to finance the acquisition of major
depreciable assets. A capital lease is a long term lease that transfers to the
lessee most rights and obligations concerning the asset leased, and usually
transfers ownership at the end of the lease. The city council should consider
the advice of the city's finance professional or bond counsel when capital
leasing arrangements are used and when federal tax forms are prepared to ensure
that all federal tax laws are followed. (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-10: INVESTMENT OF BOND PROCEEDS:
   A.   The investment of bond proceeds shall be dictated by the bond
indenture, state statutes and the city's investment policy. The city finance
director-treasurer, with the advice of the city's financial professional, shall
prepare the drawdown requirements for the bond proceeds which shall be used to
create investment parameters for the bond proceeds. (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011;
amd. 2013 Code)
   B.   Due consideration shall be given debt covenants and arbitrage
requirements, the purpose of which is to maintain compliance with both.
Investment adjustments shall be made as required.
   C.   Debt service reserve funds shall be maintained and invested, as
applicable, in compliance with the above. (Ord. 3005, 10-10-2011)
3-3-11: MODIFICATIONS OF PROVISIONS:
This chapter is not meant as all encompassing but rather a guideline, subject
to periodic (or at least annual) review by the city council, at which time it
may be modified and amended as the city council deems appropriate. (Ord. 3005,
10-10-2011)

component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.

intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this chapter,

taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another city on that

authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due
and paid in the city that was not previously allowed as a credit against any
other municipal tax.

the city or receiving in the city interstate telecommunications by a person at
a rate of five percent (5%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications

owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid and, if unpaid, is
recoverable by law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at
retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 2039, 9-19-2005, eff. 1-1-2006)

a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the
ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number
from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection
with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable
because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 2039, 9-19-2005, eff. 1-1-2006)

For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not

local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the

under this section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application
may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period
before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which
case, the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 1816, 9-10-2001;

improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and

is in default, the finance report shall release such portions of the amount
placed in escrow necessary to satisfy any outstanding lien of the mortgagee
within ten (10) days after receipt of a written request from the first
mortgagee if the funds are not held by the city as costs of demolition to the
property. The city must initiate demolition proceedings in a court of law

replacement or removal of the structure and consents to payments of funds held
in escrow directly to the contractor performing such services, the funds shall
be released only to such contractor. (Ord. 3360, 11-28-2016)
3-10-6: USE OF RETAINED PROCEEDS UPON FAILURE TO SHOW REASONABLE PROOF:

4-3C-17: DENIALS OF APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE:  
The rules contained in this section and the subsections thereunder shall govern
all hearings requested upon issuance of a notice of denial of an application
for licensure. Hearings under this section and the divisions thereunder are de
novo proceedings for the creation of a record regarding an applicant's
suitability for licensure. A hearing under this section and the subsections
thereunder is not an appeal of the liquor commissioner's action.
   A.   Requests for Hearing:
      1.   If the liquor commissioner finds that an applicant is not suitable
for licensure, the liquor commissioner shall issue the applicant a notice of
denial.
      2.   The liquor commissioner shall serve notice on the applicant by
personal service or U.S. certified mail and U.S. mail to the last known address
of the applicant. Service is complete four (4) days after mailing.
      3.   Should an applicant wish to contest the action the liquor
commissioner has taken regarding his or her application, the applicant must
submit a request for hearing to the liquor commissioner.
      4.   All requests for hearing shall be in writing and shall include an
original and one copy. The request shall contain the following:
         a.   The name, current address and current telephone number of the
applicant;
            (1)   Detailed reasons why and the facts upon which the applicant
will rely to show that the applicant is suitable for licensure, including
specific responses to any facts enumerated in the Illinois gaming board's
notice of denial; and
            (2)   A signature of the applicant.
            (3)   A verification of the request for hearing in the following
form:
               The undersigned certifies that the statements set forth in this
request are true and correct, except as to matters therein stated to be on
information and belief and as to such matters the undersigned certifies as
aforesaid that he/she verily believes the same to be true.
            (4)   The request must be notarized.
            (5)   A deposit of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to secure the
attendance of a stenographer at the hearing to record the proceedings.
Following the conclusion of the hearing, the City shall either refund to the
applicant any portion of the deposit that exceeds the cost of the stenographer
to record the proceedings or shall invoice the applicant for the amount of the
cost of the stenographer to record the proceedings that exceeds the deposit.
      5.   A request for hearing must be made within ten (10) days after
receipt of notice of denial from the liquor commissioner. A request shall be
deemed filed on the date on which it is postmarked.
      6.   If a request for hearing is not filed within ten (10) days after the
receipt of notice from the liquor commissioner, then the notice of denial
becomes the final order of the liquor commissioner denying the applicant's
license application.
      7.   A request for hearing shall be deemed granted unless denied. The
liquor commissioner may deny a request for hearing if the statement of the
reasons and facts that it contains does not establish a prima facie case or
fails to comply with any of the other requirements of this section. The liquor
commissioner's denial of a request for hearing is a final decision, and the
denial of licensure becomes a final order on the date the liquor commissioner
denies the request for hearing.
      8.   A request for hearing may not be withdrawn or voluntarily dismissed
if the liquor commissioner determines that withdrawal or voluntary dismissal is
not in the best interests of the public and the video gaming industry in the
City. If the liquor commissioner allows an applicant to withdraw a hearing
request, the initial notice of denial becomes a final liquor commissioner order
on the date leave to withdraw is granted. If the applicant does not prosecute
his or her case after twenty -one (21) days, the liquor commissioner may enter
a default judgment against the applicant. Failure to prosecute shall result in
entry of default judgment against the applicant.
      9.   The applicant may submit a request for hearing by:
         a.   Personal delivery;
         b.   Certified mail, postage prepaid; or
         c.   Overnight express mail, postage prepaid.

practice in Illinois. All attorneys who appear in a representative capacity on

entitled to:
         a.   The name and address of any witness who may be reasonably
expected to testify on behalf of the opposing party;
         b.   All documents or other materials in the possession or control of
the opposing party that the opposing party reasonably expects will be necessary

documents the applicant reasonably expects to introduce into evidence either in
his, her or its case in chief or in rebuttal. Rebuttal documents, to the extent
that they are not immediately identifiable, shall be tendered to the City
unless additional time is granted by the liquor commissioner.
      2.   Discovery may be obtained only through written requests to produce
witness lists, documents or other materials, as specified in subsection (c)(1)
of this section. Witnesses and documents responsive to a proper request for
production that were not produced shall be excluded from the hearing and
additional sanctions or penalties may be imposed.
   D.   Subpoenas:
      1.   Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses at hearing may be served
by a party only upon application to the liquor commissioner.
         a.   The applicant must show good cause, state the testimony to be
elicited from a witness, state why the evidence to which the testimony relates
cannot otherwise be obtained, and state the reasons why the testimony is
necessary and relevant.
         b.   An agent or employee of the City may not be required by the
applicant to appear except under the procedures provided in this section.
      2.   The liquor commissioner may issue subpoenas for the attendance of
witnesses or subpoenas duces tecum for the production of relevant documents,
records or other material at a proceeding conducted under this chapter.
   E.   Proceedings:
      1.   The burden of proof is at all times on the applicant. The applicant
shall have the affirmative responsibility of establishing by clear and
convincing evidence that the applicant is suitable for licensing or that
enforcement of a security interest is warranted.
      2.   All testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation.
      3.   All testimony and oral proceedings shall be recorded
stenographically or by such other means as to adequately ensure the
preservation of such testimony or oral proceedings and shall be transcribed on
request of any party. The stenographer or such other means as to adequately
ensure the preservation of such testimony or oral proceedings shall be arranged
by the City. The cost of the stenographer or such other means as to adequately
ensure the preservation of such testimony or oral proceedings shall be paid by
the applicant. The transcript shall be paid for by the requesting party.
      4.   Both parties may present opening statements. The applicant shall
proceed first, followed by the City.
      5.   The applicant shall then present his or her case in chief.
      6.   Upon the conclusion of the applicant's case in chief, the City may
move for a directed finding. The liquor commissioner may hear arguments on the

      7.   If no motion for directed finding is made, or if the motion is
denied or decision reserved, the City may present its case.

      10.   Both parties may present closing arguments. The applicant shall
proceed first, followed by the City, and thereafter the applicant may present
rebuttal argument.
   F.   Evidence:
      1.   The hearing need not be conducted according to the technical rules
of evidence. Any relevant evidence may be admitted and shall be sufficient in
itself to support a finding if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of
the existence of any common law or statute that might make improper the
admission of evidence over objection in a civil action. Hearsay may support a
finding of the liquor commissioner if it is the best evidence available, has
sufficient indicia of trustworthiness and reliability and is of the type
reasonably and customarily relied on in the video gaming industry.
         a.   If relevant and not precluded from the hearing by section 6(d) of
the riverboat gambling act 1  relating to all licensed applicants, official
Illinois gaming board records or certified copies of the records shall be
admissible into evidence.
         b.   Official Illinois gaming board records are documents either
prepared by or provided to the Illinois gaming board for the purpose of
conducting its regular business.
         c.   If relevant and not precluded from the hearing by a statute,

records shall be admissible into evidence.
         d.   Official City records are documents either prepared by or
provided to the City for the purpose of conducting its regular business.
         e.   An applicant must afford the City an opportunity to investigate
and verify information that the applicant intends to offer in support of his or
her case. The applicant shall not be permitted to introduce into evidence any
information that the City has not been afforded the opportunity to investigate
and verify.
      2.   The parties should, to the fullest extent possible, stipulate to all
matters that are not or fairly should not be in dispute.
      3.   The parties may make objections to evidentiary offers. When an
objection is made, the liquor commissioner may receive the disputed evidence
subject to a ruling at a later time.
      4.   The liquor commissioner may take official notice of any generally
accepted information or technical or scientific matter within the field of
video gaming, and any other fact that may be judicially noticed by courts of
this state. The parties shall be informed of any information, matter or facts
so noticed, including any City staff memoranda or data, and shall be given
reasonable opportunity to refute that information.
   G.   Prohibition On Ex Parte Communication: Once a hearing is commenced, no
applicant or its representative shall communicate directly or indirectly with
the liquor commissioner regarding any pending denial, except upon notice to and
opportunity for all parties to participate.
   H.   Sanctions and Penalties:
      1.   The liquor commissioner may impose sanctions and penalties if the
liquor commissioner finds that a party has acted in bad faith, for the purpose
of delay, or has otherwise abused the hearing process. Sanctions and penalties
include, but are not limited to, default judgment or directed finding on one or
more issues.
      2.   If an applicant fails to testify on his or her own behalf with
respect to any question propounded to him or her, the liquor commissioner may
infer that such testimony or answer would have been adverse to the petitioner's
case.
      3.   Failure of an applicant to appear at a hearing or scheduled
proceeding shall constitute an admission of all matters and facts contained in
the notice of denial. In such cases the liquor commissioner may take action
based upon that admission or upon any other evidence, including affidavits,
without any further notice to the applicant.
   I.   Hearing Record and Order:
      1.   The record shall consist of the following:
         a.   The notice of denial, the request for hearing and all motions and
rulings;
         b.   All evidence received;
         c.   A statement of matters officially noticed; and
         d.   Offers of proof, objections and rulings.
      2.   Upon conclusion of the hearing the liquor commissioner shall review
the entire record and shall render a written order including written findings
of fact and conclusions of law on which the liquor commissioner's decision is
based. The findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence and on
matters officially noticed.
      3.   Copies of the liquor commissioner's final order shall be served on
the applicant by personal delivery, certified mail or overnight express mail to
applicant's last known address.
      4.   The liquor commissioner's final order shall become effective upon
personal delivery to the applicant or upon posting by certified or overnight
express mail to applicant's last known address.
   J.   Status of Applicant for Licensure Upon Filing Request for Hearing: An
applicant who has been denied a license and who has requested a hearing under
this subsection shall be considered an applicant for purposes of compliance
with applicable statutory provisions and this section until final resolution of
the request for hearing. (Ord. 3567, 9-23-2019)

of evidence. Any relevant evidence may be admitted and shall be sufficient in
itself to support a finding if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of
the existence of any common law or statute that might make improper the
admission of evidence over objection in a civil action. Hearsay may support a
finding of the liquor commissioner if it is the best evidence available, has
sufficient indicia of trustworthiness and reliability, and is of the type
reasonably and customarily relied on in the gaming industry.
         a.   If relevant, and not precluded from the hearing by section 6(d)
of the riverboat gambling act 1  relating to all licensed applicants, the
official Illinois gaming board records or certified copies of the records shall

prepared by or provided to the Illinois gaming board for the purpose of

matters that are not or fairly should not be in dispute.
      3.   The parties may make objections to evidentiary offers. When an
objection is made, the liquor commissioner may receive the disputed evidence
subject to a ruling at a later time.
      4.   The liquor commissioner may take official notice of any generally
accepted information or technical or scientific matter within the field of
video gaming, and any other fact that may be judicially noticed by courts of
this state. The parties shall be informed of any information, matter or facts
so noticed, including any City staff memoranda or data, and shall be given
reasonable opportunity to refute that information.
   H.   Prohibition On Ex Parte Communication: No licensee or its
representative shall communicate directly or indirectly with the liquor
commissioner regarding any pending disciplinary matter, except upon notice to
and opportunity for all parties to participate.
   I.   Sanctions and Penalties:
      1.   The liquor commissioner may impose sanctions and penalties if the
liquor commissioner finds that a party has acted in bad faith, for the purpose
of delay, or has otherwise abused the hearing process. Such sanctions and
penalties include, but are not limited to, default judgment or directed finding
on one or more issues.
      2.   If a licensee fails to testify on his or her own behalf with respect
to any question propounded to him or her, the liquor commissioner may infer
that such testimony or answer would have been adverse to the licensee's case.
      3.   Failure of a licensee to appear at a hearing or scheduled proceeding
shall constitute an admission of all matters and facts contained in the
complaint. In such cases the liquor commissioner may take action based upon
that admission or upon any other evidence, including affidavits, without any
further notice to the licensee.
   J.   Hearing Record and Order:
      1.   The record shall consist of the following:
         a.   The notice of denial, the request for hearing and all motions and
rulings;

         c.   A statement of matters officially noticed; and
         d.   Offers of proof, objections and rulings.
      2.   Upon conclusion of the hearing the liquor commissioner shall review
the entire record and shall render a written order including written findings
of fact and conclusions of law on which the liquor commissioner's decision is
based. The findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence and on
matters officially noticed.
      3.   Copies of the liquor commissioner's final order shall be served on
the licensee by personal delivery, certified mail or overnight express mail to
licensee's last known address.
      4.   The liquor commissioner's final order shall become effective upon
personal delivery to the licensee or upon posting by certified or overnight
express mail to applicant's last known address.
   K.   Penalties:

restrict any license issued under this chapter or impose other disciplinary
action for any act or failure to act by the licensee or by the licensee's
agents or employees that violates any provision of the video gaming act or the
regulations promulgated under the video gaming act or this chapter.

one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Each and every day that a violation occurs or

imposed. In addition to the penalties provided herein, the City shall have
available to it all remedies in law or in equity or as may be otherwise
provided for by the ordinances of the City.
      6.   Every gambling device found in a licensed video gaming location in
the City operating gambling games in violation of this chapter shall be subject
to seizure and confiscation and shall be turned over to the Illinois gaming
board as provided in section 1800.1110 of the Illinois administrative code.
      7.   Any City liquor license issued by the liquor commissioner under the
provisions of section 4-2 of this code to any operator of a licensed video
gaming location that operates or permits the operation of a video gaming
terminal within its establishment in violation of this chapter shall be
immediately revoked. (Ord. 3567, 9-23-2019)

4-13-2: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to accommodate the tradition of opening up one’s
residence to travelers as they pass through the community. This tradition has
been brought into the 20th century in a form called “Bed and Breakfast
Establishments” or “Vacation Rentals”. This chapter is intended to encourage
the development of such facilities in the city, while at the same time
establishing minimum regulations which are intended to protect and preserve the
character of the neighborhoods in which these facilities are usually found and
to protect the traveling public. Further, this trend is seen as one way to
preserve and perhaps restore some of the city’s more valuable historically and
architecturally significant structures that might otherwise be lost due to
economic conditions. (Ord. 3693, 12-28-2020)
4-13-3: RELATIONSHIP TO ZONING:
Bed and breakfast establishments and vacation rentals shall conform to
applicable provisions of Title 11. Where there are conflicts between Title 11
and this chapter, Title 11 shall govern. (Ord. 3693, 12-28-2020)
4-13-4: LICENSE REQUIRED:
No person shall operate a bed and breakfast establishment or vacation rental
without first having obtained a license from the city and paying an annual
license fee of $250 in addition to other required fees. All annual licenses
expire at Midnight on January 31 of each year and the fee shall not be prorated
for shorter terms. Licenses must be obtained by following the procedures

The city council finds that abandoned and derelict vehicles constitute a safety
hazard and a public nuisance; are detrimental to the health, safety and welfare
of the general public by harboring disease, providing breeding places for
vermin, inviting plundering, creating fire hazards, and presenting physical
dangers to children and others; produce scenic blights which degrade the
environment and adversely affect land values and the proper maintenance and
continuing development of the city; represent a resource out of place and an
energy loss to the economy; and require local governmental attention in order
to assure the expeditious removal of these abandoned and derelict vehicles. The
city council declares, therefore, that it is the policy of the city to prohibit
the abandonment of vehicles and the retention of derelicts and to enforce such
prohibition by law. (Ord. 1759, 3-27-2000)
5-8A-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
herein ascribed, except as the context may otherwise require:

any other person legally entitled to possession thereof.
   C.   When a vehicle removal from either public or private property is

of or otherwise discovering an abandoned or derelict vehicle, the police
department shall, if it does not already know the identification of the
registered owner or other person legally entitled thereto, cause the vehicle
and license registration records of the secretary of state of the state of
Illinois, or a foreign state if applicable, to be searched utilizing the
vehicle identification number and license plate year and number displayed on
the vehicle, if any. The owner of such vehicle, as disclosed from the search,
shall be the owner of such vehicle for the purposes of the disposition of such
vehicle. The city police department shall further cause the motor vehicle files
of the Illinois state police to be searched by a directed communication to the
Illinois state police for stolen or wanted information on the vehicle. When the
Illinois state police files are searched with negative results, the information
contained in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) files shall be
searched in accordance with state law by the Illinois state police. When the
registered owner or other person legally entitled to the possession of a
vehicle cannot be identified from the registration files of the state of
Illinois or from the registration files of a foreign state, if applicable, the
city police department shall so notify the Illinois state police for the
purpose of identifying the vehicle owner or other person legally entitled to
the possession of the vehicle. The information obtained by the Illinois state
police shall be immediately forwarded to the city police department.
   B.   Notice To Owner:

an abandoned or derelict vehicle is known or has been determined in accordance

determined to be an abandoned or derelict vehicle in violation of this article
and that unless such vehicle is removed within seven (7) days from the date
such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, by certified mail, the vehicle will be
towed and impounded in accordance herewith, and the owner will be charged with
having violated this article. The chief of police, or his designee, may cause,
but is not required, to personally serve such notice on such owner or other
person, and need not establish whether such notice is actually received if
mailed. In those instances where the certified notification specified herein
has been returned by the postal authorities to the city police department due
to the addressee having moved, being unknown at the address obtained from the
registration records of the state of Illinois, or having refused delivery, the
sending of a second certified notice is not required. A copy of such notice
shall also be served upon any lienholder if the same has been disclosed by the
title search required herein. The notice required by this subsection B1 may be
in substantially the following form: (Ord. 1759, 3-27-2000; amd. 2013 Code)

5-13-1: PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS:
   A.   Purpose. Recognizing that vacant buildings and properties contribute to
blight in both residential and non-residential neighborhoods, discourage
economic development and hinder appreciation of property values, endanger
public health and safety, attract criminal activity, and create fire hazards,
it is the responsibility of property owners to prevent buildings from becoming
a burden to the neighborhood and community and a threat to the public health,
safety, and welfare. Maintenance of the public health, safety, and welfare thus
requires the City to maintain an accurate registration of all vacant buildings
and properties.
   B.   Definitions.
BUILDING:
A building, accessory structure, mobile or modular structure, or other
structure adapted to permanent occupancy for residential or commercial
purposes.
CITY:

RESIDENTIAL:
Any "residential structure or property" as defined in the Marion Code.

VACANT BUILDING:
A building or property that is unattended or unoccupied and is not actively
used as a place of residence or business, has not had regular continuous water
service for six (6) months or more, or the building is frequently open or
unsecured so that unauthorized admittance may be gained without damaging any
portion of the property. A residential or commercial building or property will
be considered vacant when found to be in the above condition for more than six
(6) months and subject to the registration requirements found in Section 2.
Authorized admittance may only be shown by proof of a valid and current written
lease, agreement or contract. (Ord. 4040, 5-12-2025)

($1,500.00);
         b.   If the building requires remodeling, waive permit fees if
remodeling occurs within ninety (90) days of registration.
      7.   If the owner of the vacant building or property does not reside in
Williamson County for at least six (6) months a year, then they must provide

rental rate based upon market rental rates for comparable properties shall have
fees exempt for three (3) months. It is the obligation of the vacant building
owner to produce evidence of active marketing to claim this exemption. In the

resume occupancy of the vacant building as a dwelling within 180 days shall
have fees exempt for six (6) months. Failure to actually resume use of the
vacant building as a dwelling within 180 days will result in imposition of the
registration fee that was exempted under this section which shall be
immediately due and owing;
         a.   If a request for an extension is made, the Building and Code
Office may grant a one-time extension of up to three (3) months after an

not limited to, civil actions being filed in district court, suits or actions
being maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction, abatement of nuisances
maintained in violation of this chapter, institution of injunction, mandamus,

   A.   Dangerous Animal: Any animal which, when either unmuzzled, unleashed,
or unattended by its owner or custodian behaves in a manner that a reasonable
person would believe poses a serious and unjustified imminent threat of serious
physical injury or death to a person or a companion animal in a public place,
and without justification, shows a propensity to attack or injure any person(s)
or animal who was peacefully conducting themselves in any place where they may
lawfully be present may be declared dangerous.
   B.   Dangerous Dog: Any individual dog, which when either unmuzzled, or
unattended by its owner or custodian, acts in a vicious or terrorizing manner,
approaches any person in an apparent attitude of attack upon streets,
sidewalks, or any public grounds or places, or upon private property not owned
or belonging to the owner of the animal may be declared “dangerous” by the
animal control officer.
      1.   Request And Investigation: An animal control officer or any adult
person may request, in writing, that a dog be classified as a dangerous animal
by submitting a sworn written statement of complaint to the animal control
officer or police officer. In addition, in any instance where the animal
control officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a dog has bitten a
person or a domestic animal, an investigation shall be conducted. For any
animal to be considered a dangerous animal there must be a thorough
investigation initiated within fourteen (14) days of becoming aware of the
alleged violation. The animal control officer must also gather medical and
veterinary evidence, interview witnesses, and make a detailed report of
findings.
      2.   Notification And During The Investigation: Upon receipt of the
complaint, the animal control officer shall notify the owner of the animal that
a formal complaint has been filed and that an investigation into the allegation
as set forth in the complaint will be conducted. During the investigation:

shall not be transferred by its owner to any other person; nor shall the place
of maintenance of the animal be changed from its owner’s residence during that
time, without the consent of the animal control officer or order of any court;
or

police officer if there is reason to believe that the animal will pose an
immediate danger to the owner or any member of the community if not immediately
impounded.
      3.   Impoundment: The animal control officer shall impound the animal and
shall inform its owner, within twenty four (24) hours of impoundment, that two
(2) or more of the factors enumerated herein exist. The owner shall not allow
or permit the animal declared “dangerous” to return to the City under any
circumstances.
      4.   Determination And Appeal: No animal shall be deemed dangerous
without sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to support such
finding. The owner shall be sent immediate notification of the investigative
determination that includes a complete description of the appeal process. An
animal shall not be declared dangerous if the animal control officer determines
the conduct of the animal was justified because:
         a.   The threat was sustained by a person who at the time was
committing a crime of offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog;
         b.   The threatened person was tormenting, abusing, assaulting, or
physically threatening the dog or its offspring;
         c.   The injured, threatened, or killed companion animal was attacking
or threatening to attack the dog or its offspring;
         d.   The dog was responding to pain or injury or was protecting
itself, its owner, or custodian or member of its household, kennel, or
offspring.
      5.   Conclusion: At the conclusion of the investigation, the animal
control officer may:
         a.   Determine that the animal is not dangerous and, if the animal was
initially impounded, waive any impoundment fees incurred, and release the
animal to its owner; or
         b.   Determine that the animal is dangerous and, if impounded, release
the animal to the owner after the owner has paid all fees incurred for the
impoundment. If all impoundment fees have not been paid within ten (10)
business days after a final determination that an animal is dangerous, the
animal control officer may cause the animal to be humanely euthanized; or
         c.   Determine that the animal is vicious, in which case the
provisions of section
6-4-3-9 of this chapter shall apply.

   C.   Request For Hearing: If the owner of record of a vehicle seized
pursuant to this section desires to appeal the seizure, said owner must make a
request for said hearing within twenty four (24) hours of the seizure. Said
request shall be in writing and filed with the Chief of Police or her designee.
If an appeal is timely filed, a Hearing Officer of the City shall conduct such
appeal hearing within forty eight (48) hours after the request, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the vehicle impoundment hearing. The
formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence
shall be admissible. If, after the hearing, the Hearing Officer determines
there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and
impoundment pursuant to this section, the Hearing Officer shall order the
continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section, unless the
owner of the vehicle posts with the City Clerk, a cash bond in the amount of
one hundred dollars ($100.00), plus any applicable towing and storage fees.
   D.   Hearing; Failure To Appear: Unless a hearing is held pursuant to
subsection C of this section, within ten (10) days after a vehicle is seized
and impounded pursuant to this section, the City shall notify by certified
mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the date, time and
location of a hearing that will be conducted pursuant, to this section. The
hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the Hearing
Officer, no later than forty five (45) days after the vehicle was seized. The
hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing Officer appointed by the Mayor. All
interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the
hearing. If, after the hearing, the Hearing Officer determines by a
preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with a
violation of section 30-225, and that none of the exceptions described in
clauses (1) or (2) of subsection (a) applies, the Hearing Officer shall enter
an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the City
for an administrative penalty in the amount not to exceed one hundred dollars
($100.00). If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the Hearing
Officer shall enter a default order in favor of the City requiring the payment
to the City of an administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed one hundred
dollars ($100.00). If the Hearing Officer finds that no such violation
occurred, the Hearing Officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's
vehicle or cash bond.
   E.   Administrative Penalty: If an administrative penalty is imposed
pursuant to this section, such penalty shall constitute a debt due to owing the
City. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond shall
be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle has been impounded when such a penalty
is imposed, the City may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such
judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise
in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until: 1) the
penalty, plus any applicable towing and storage fees, is paid to the City, in
which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is
legally entitled to possess the vehicle; 2) the vehicle is sold or otherwise
disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the
administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days
after an administrative penalty is imposed under subsection D of this section
against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing,
the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner
provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases,
if the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within thirty
(30) days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of the
Hearing Officer's determination may be sought or within thirty (30) days after
an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the City,
whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be
disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed
vehicles under section 4-208 of the Illinois Vehicle Code 1 .
   F.   Penalty And Fees Paid: Except as otherwise specifically provided by
law, no owner, lienholder or other person shall be legally entitled to take
possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until the civil penalty
and fees applicable under this section have been paid. (Ord. 3376, 5-8-2017)

maximum of two (2) shepherd staffs are allowed for multiple plot lots. All
shepherd staffs not by monuments or without flowers on them are subject to
removal. No metal of any kind that protrudes aboveground will be allowed to be

Notes
  1. Editor's Note: In conversation with City officials, Ordinance 2266 was
  adopted to qualify the City to receive grant dollars for use regarding the
  City water system. The City is not enforcing said ordinance even though it
  was passed subsequent to those provisions codified in this chapter, including
  article A, and were unable to provide Sterling Codifiers with any information
1 regarding what, if any, provisions of Ordinance 2266 should be codified. City
  officials did inform Sterling Codifiers that what appears as article A are
  the provisions they prefer to be codified. Sterling Codifiers was unable to
  determine what other provisions of this chapter were superseded by the
  adoption of Ordinance 2266. Therefore, Ordinance 2266 and amending Ordinance
  2363 have not been included in the Code.

9-3A-1: BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE; SURCHARGE:
The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge and a
surcharge, if applicable.
   A.   Basic User Charge: The basic user charge shall be based on water usage
as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the
following normal concentrations:
      1.   a. A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of three hundred milligrams per liter (300 mg/l).
         b.   A suspended solids (SS) content of three hundred milligrams per
liter (300 mg/l).
      2.   The basic user charge shall consist of operation and maintenance
costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows:
         a.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
         b.   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories
by volume, suspended solids and BOD, if possible.
         c.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated.
         d.   Proportion the estimated costs to nonindustrial and industrial
users by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
         e.   Compute cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage
strength.
         f.   Compute surcharge costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons per
milligrams per liter in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
   B.   Debt Service Charge: The debt service charge shall be computed by
dividing the annual debt service of all outstanding bonds and service charges
related to bonds by the number of users. Through further divisions, the monthly
and quarterly debt service charges can be computed.
   C.   Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed
the normal concentrations for BOD (300 milligrams per liter) and SS (300
milligrams per liter). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded
by water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the three
hundred milligrams per liter (300 mg/l) concentration for BOD and SS
respectively. Subsection 9-3A-3B of this article specifies the procedure to
compute a surcharge.
   D.   Review Of Charges: The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall
be reviewed annually by certified public accountants for the city in their
annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised
periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in operation and
maintenance costs including replacement costs. (1977 Code § 13.50.010)
9-3A-2: MEASUREMENT OF FLOW:
   A.   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of
one hundred (100) gallons.
   B.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewer procures any
part or all of his water from sources other than the public waterworks system,
all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall
install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the
city for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these
other sources.
   C.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by
the city if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water
consumption records.
   D.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the city. (1977 Code § 13.50.020)
9-3A-3: RATES AND CHARGES ESTABLISHED:
   A.   Basic User Rate and Debt Service Charge:

         a.   All rates shall be updated and established by May 1 of each year
and available from the Water Office and on the City of Marion website.
         b.   There shall be and is hereby established a minimum charge and a
basic user rate for service supplied by the wastewater facility of the city.
         c.   A minimum monthly charge, including debt service, shall be
charged to users who use less than two thousand (2,000) gallons of water. Any
user who uses 2001 or more shall be charged per the rate schedule as
established by the City Water and Sewer Department
         d.   A basic user rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water
consumption and/or metered sewers in excess of the established minimum shall be
and is hereby established for all sewer users.
      2.   Debt Service Charge: A monthly debt service charge will be added for
all wastewater facility users within the City.
      3.   Nonmetered Residential Users: All nonmetered residential users of
the wastewater facilities shall pay the debt service charge, the minimum
service charge and the basic user rate established in this subsection. In the
event use of the wastewater facilities is determined by the city to be in
excess of two thousand (2,000) gallons monthly, the city may require such flat
rate user to install metering devices on the water supply or sewer main to
measure the amount of service supplied.
   B.   Surcharge Rate: The rates of surcharges for BOD 5 and SS shall be as
follows: For each pound of BOD5 and SS contributed by the user based on
milligrams per liter during the billing period, a surcharge will be levied for
each pound of BOD5 above the three hundred milligrams per liter (300 mg/l)
level.
   C.   Surcharge: The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges
shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as
often as may be deemed necessary by the city and shall be binding as a basis
for surcharges. (Ord. 2360, 6-13-2011; amd. Ord. 2361, 6-13-2011; Ord. 3723, 4-

9-3A-4: COMPUTATION OF RATES AND CHARGES:
   A.   Wastewater Service Charge: The wastewater service charge shall be
computed by the following formula:
        CW = CD + CM + (Vu-X)CU + CS
          
Where: CW = Amount of wastewater service charge ($) per billing period
      CD = Debt service charge (subsection 9-3A-3A2 of this article)
      CM = Minimum charge for operation, maintenance, replacement and debt
            service (subsection 9-3A-3A1 of this article)
      Vu = Wastewater volume for the billing period
      X  = Allowable consumption in gallons for the minimum charge (subsection
            9-3A-3A1 of this article)
      CU = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance, replacement (subsection
            9-3A-3A1 of this article)
      CS = Amount of surcharge (subsection 9-3A-3B of this article)
 
(1977 Code § 13.50.070)
   B.   Surcharge: The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges
shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as
often as may be deemed necessary by the city and shall be binding as a basis
for surcharges. (1977 Code § 13.50.060)
9-3A-5: FEES FOR TREATMENT OF BULK SEWAGE WASTES:
   A.   Minimum Fee: All sewage wastes transported to the wastewater treatment
plant in bulk containers such as trucks, tanks, or similar enclosed containers
shall be assessed a minimum dumping fee per container. Before dumping, the
waste must have been inspected and/or tested by the wastewater treatment
superintendent and found acceptable for wastewater plant treatment. Only those
wastes generated in the city will be accepted at said wastewater treatment
plant. Any exception would have to be approved by the sewer commissioner, with
the advice of the wastewater treatment plant superintendent.
   B.   Surcharge: For those wastes brought to the wastewater treatment plant
in containers and having a BOD5 in excess of three hundred milligrams per liter
(300 mg/l), a surcharge per pound of BOD5 shall be charged to the waste
contributor. The tests will be run by employees of the city wastewater
treatment plant and these results used in assessing the charges. If the waste
contributor so desires, an independent testing laboratory, approved by both the
city and the waste contributor, may be used for testing the BOD5. (Ord. 1297,

   E.   To provide minimum standards for the maintenance of existing

health ordinance, or regulation of the city regulating existing buildings, the
provision which established the most restrictive standard shall prevail, except
that the provisions of this chapter shall, with regard to nonowner occupied

For Rehabilitation", as follows:
      1.   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site environment.
      2.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      3.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      4.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      5.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      6.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.

damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of the

protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.

work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      10.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   D.   Design Guidelines: Design guidelines for applying the criteria for
review of certificates of appropriateness shall, at a minimum, consider the
following architectural criteria:
      1.   Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction should
be compatible with the style and character of the landmark and with surrounding
structures in a historic district.
      2.   Proportions Of Windows And Doors: The proportions and relationships
between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and
character of the landmark.
      3.   Relationship Of Building Masses And Spaces: The relationship of a
structure within a historic district to the open space between it and adjoining
structures should be compatible.
      4.   Roof Shape: The design of the roof, fascia, and cornice should be
compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark.
      5.   Landscaping: Landscaping should be compatible with the architectural
character and appearance of the landmark.

partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and
character and with surrounding structures in a historic district.
      7.   Directional Expression: Facades in historic districts should blend
with other structures with regard to directional expression. Structures in a
historic district should be compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical
expression of surrounding structures. The directional expression of a landmark
after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with
its original architectural style and character.
      8.   Architectural Details: Architectural details including types of
materials, colors, and textures should be treated so as to make the landmark
compatible with its original architectural style and character of a landmark or
historic district.

safeguard the general welfare of the property owner including the quiet and
peaceful enjoyment of residential property, to preserve and protect the

commercial pursuits. In establishing the standards, the following findings are
made:
   A.   A multiplicity of signs is distracting to motorists and a hazard to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

effort of local business establishments to reasonably identify the location and
nature of their business and may contribute to a lowering of commercial and
residential property values.
   C.   It is a public purpose to limit commercial signs in the City to those
reasonably necessary to identify local businesses, to limit distractions to
motorists and reduce danger to vehicular traffic and pedestrians, to control
and abate the unsightly use of buildings and land and to preserve the overall
beauty and landscape and residential and commercial architecture.
   D.   It is the intent of the Council that signs will be approved or
disapproved entirely without regard to the content to be posted thereon. (Ord.

the proposed special use. The chair of the board of appeals shall have the
responsibility of scheduling the public hearings and sending out notices to
that effect. At the hearing, any interested party may appear and testify,

neighboring property and on the city's overall tax base;
      3.   The effect the proposed special use would have on public utilities
and on traffic circulation on nearby streets; and

as schools or hospitals) that require special protection.
   D.   Council Action: The council shall act on every request for special use
permits at their regularly scheduled meeting following submission of the
advisory report of the board of appeals. Without further public hearing, the

         e.   Specific section(s) of this title containing the regulations
which, if strictly applied, would cause a serious problem; and
         f.   Any other pertinent information that the administrator may
require. A filing fee is required.
   B.   Public Hearing; Notice: The board of appeals shall hold a public
hearing on each variance request within a reasonable time after the variance
application is submitted thereto. At the hearing, any interested party may
appear and testify, either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney.
Notice indicating the time, date, and place of the hearing and nature of the
proposed variance shall be given not more than thirty (30) nor less than
fifteen (15) days before the hearing:
      1.   By first class mail to the applicant and to all parties whose
property abuts the property for which the variance is requested.
      2.   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
city.
   C.   Standards For Variance: The board of appeals shall not recommend nor
shall the council grant any variance unless, based upon the evidence presented
to them, they determine that:
      1.   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of
this title; and
      2.   Strict application of the district requirements would result in
great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant and prevent a
reasonable return on the property; and
      3.   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from such
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardships and allow a
reasonable return on the property; and
      4.   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other property within the district, and therefore, the variance
would be more appropriately a remedy than an amendment (rezoning); and
      5.   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the area where the premises in question is located.
   D.   Advisory Report; Council Decision: Within a reasonable time after the
public hearing, the board of appeals shall submit an advisory report to the
council. The council may grant a variance by simple majority vote of all
members then holding office and shall act on the requested variance at their
next regularly scheduled meeting following submission of the advisory report of
the board of appeals. In accordance with state law, the council shall specify
the terms of relief granted (if any) in one statement and their findings of
fact in another statement. The findings of fact shall clearly indicate the
council's reasons for granting or denying any requested variance. (Ord. 1148,
4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987; amd. 2013 Code)

to change the status of any use, the board of appeals shall include in their
advisory report findings of fact concerning each of the following matters:
      1.   Existing use(s) and zoning of the property in question;

amendment. The city council may initiate the proceeding. (Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987,

   E.   Inspections, Notices; Issuance Of Occupancy Permits:
      1.   The director of code enforcement shall receive all applications for
commercial occupancy permits and shall make or cause to be made an inspection

writing, informing him that the premises or structure may not be occupied until
the deficiencies are corrected.
      3.   When the director finds that the premises or structure does comply
with the standards most recently adopted by the city and other applicable
standards, he shall issue an occupancy permit.

made in an inspection performed by the city may request a review by the
director of code enforcement. If the director of code enforcement, after review
of the file and such additional information as he may deem appropriate, feels
that the citation of the violation is valid, he shall require that the
violation be corrected. Any decision of the director of code enforcement may be
appealed to the city council upon a written request within ten (10) days of the
decision of the director of code enforcement.
   I.   Certificates Not A Warranty: In issuing a certificate of commercial
occupancy, the city does not intend to, nor does it warrant, insure or

The city participates in the national flood insurance program as administered
by the federal emergency management agency (FEMA). FEMA has prepared a set of
maps entitled "City Floodway - Flood Boundaries (Effective September 15, 1983)"
which depicts the extent of the 100-year flood. The maps are incorporated into
this title by reference, and the extent of the 100-year flood boundaries
constitute the boundaries of the floodplain overlay district. No development is
permitted in the floodplain overlay district, regardless of the underlying zone
district, except in conformity with title 13, chapter 1 of this code. The
administrator will interpret the extent of the floodplain overlay district at
the time of zone clearance (see section
11-3-2 of this title). (Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)

11-10B-4: Interpretation
11-10B-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the APO airport overlay district is to coordinate the land use
control functions of the city and the county regional airport. (Ord. 1148, 4-
27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)
11-10B-2: CITY ZONING REGULATIONS AND COUNTY AIRPORT ZONING ORDINANCE APPLY:
Uses proposed in areas designated as APO airport overlay district on the
official zoning map are additionally subject to the provisions of the county
regional airport zoning ordinance as enabled by the airport zoning act of 1945.
In this regard, all requests for development permits, including building
permits, planned unit development permits, or special use permits, or requests
for zone changes, amendments, or variances within the APO district shall
receive the concurrent review of the city and the county airport authority.
(Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)
11-10B-3: REQUEST FOR ZONING ACTION; REVIEW BY CITY AND COUNTY:
   A.   Upon receipt of a request for a development permit of any kind, zone
change, amendment, or variance under the provisions of this title located
within the APO district by the city, the city will forward a copy of the
request in its entirety to the airport authority. The airport authority will be
extended up to fifteen (15) days to review the request for conformity with the
provisions of the airport zoning ordinance, during which period the city will
take no further action.
   B.   A statement of consistency from the airport authority or a lapse of
fifteen (15) days without comment will release the city to continue the routine
processing of the request.
   C.   Should the airport authority determine, upon review, that the request
is not in compliance with the airport zoning ordinance, an objection may be
filed with the city. Upon receipt of an objection, the administrator will
arrange a timely joint meeting of the zoning board of appeals and duly
authorized representatives of the airport authority which will investigate the
circumstances of the objection and seek alternative approaches to the requested
action, if any, that could be employed to satisfy the objection.
   D.   All parties affected by the request, including counsel, may attend and
participate in said joint meeting. The zoning board of appeals will record all
comments and will attach said comments to an advisory report, including
findings of fact, to be forwarded to the city council.
   E.   Should the objection not be resolved by this method, the city council
will uphold the objection and deny the request if the objection is based on a
more restrictive regulation. (Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)
11-10B-4: INTERPRETATION:
In all cases of interpreting any differences between the two (2) ordinances,
the more restrictive regulations will apply so long as the regulations are
based on safety hazards or noise considerations as identified by the airport
zoning ordinance. (Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)

number of parking spaces, three hundred fifty (350) square feet of gross area
shall be deemed one parking space.
   D.   If computation of the number of parking spaces required by this title
results in a fractional space, any fraction of one- half (1/2) or more shall be
counted as one space.
   E.   No space or portion thereof needed to satisfy the minimum applicable
requirement for number of off street parking spaces shall be counted as part of
the off street parking spaces required for another structure or use. (Ord.

CHAPTER 14
NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION:
11-14-1: Purpose
11-14-2: Nonconforming Lots
11-14-3: Nonconforming Structures
11-14-4: Nonconforming Uses
11-14-5: Existing Permits
11-14-1: PURPOSE:
The requirements imposed by this title are designed to guide the use of land by
encouraging the development of structures and uses that are compatible with the
predominant character of each of the various districts. Lots, structures, and
uses of land or structures that do not conform to the requirements of the
district in which they are located tend to impede appropriate development. For
example, nonconformities are frequently responsible for heavy traffic on
residential streets, the overtaxing of parking facilities, the creation of
nuisances, and/or the lowering of property values. The regulations of this
chapter are intended to alleviate such existing/potential problems by
encouraging the gradual elimination of nonconformities. (Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987,
eff. 6-1-1987)
11-14-2: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
   A.   Any vacant lot that does not conform to one or more of the lot size
(area, dimensions) requirements of the district in which it is located may,
nonetheless, be developed for any use permitted in that district if such vacant
lot:
      1.   Was recorded in the office of the county recorder of deeds prior to
the effective date hereof; and
      2.   Is at least thirty feet (30') wide.
   B.   If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots with continuous street
frontage were of record and in common ownership on the effective date hereof,
and if one or more of those lots does not meet the minimum lot width, depth, or
area requirements of the district in which it is located, the land involved
shall be considered an undivided parcel. No portion of any such parcel shall be
developed (used) except in compliance with this title, nor shall any such
parcel be divided so as to create a lot that does not meet the requirements of
this title. (Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)
11-14-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
Any otherwise lawful structure which exists on the effective date hereof but
which could not be erected under the terms of this title because of
requirements/restrictions concerning lot size, height, setbacks, or other
characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot may lawfully
remain, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Maintenance: A nonconforming structure may be maintained by ordinary
repairs.
   B.   Enlargement, Alterations: A nonconforming structure may be enlarged
and/or altered; provided, that:
      1.   Such enlargement and/or alteration is confined within the lot lines
of the property in question as such lot lines existed on the effective date
hereof; and
      2.   Such enlargement and/or alteration does not increase or worsen the
nonconforming characteristics of the structure.
   C.   Reconstruction:
      1.   A nonconforming structure that is damaged or destroyed may be
rebuilt; provided, that:
         a.   Reconstruction commences within one year from the date of damage/
destruction and is diligently pursued to completion; and
         b.   The structure, when reconstructed, will not be more nonconforming
than it had been.
      2.   If reconstruction does not commence within one year or is not
diligently pursued to completion, as determined by the administrator, the
damaged structure shall be considered abandoned. Reconstruction at that point
shall be allowed only if the structure will be rebuilt in conformity with the
provisions of this title which are applicable to new structures.
   D.   Relocation: A nonconforming structure shall not be moved to another lot
unless, after relocation, it will conform to all the regulations of the
district where it will be situated. (Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)
11-14-4: NONCONFORMING USES:
Any otherwise lawful use existing on the effective date hereof that would not
be permitted under the terms of this title may lawfully continue, subject to
the following provisions:
   A.   Expansion/Intensification:
      1.   A nonconforming use which does not occupy a structure (such as a
plant nursery) may be expanded/intensified, but only within the confines of the
lot lines as such lot lines existed on the effective date hereof.
      2.   A nonconforming use which occupies a structure may be expanded or
intensified, but only within that structure and/or within any conforming
addition to said structure. (For rules concerning expansion of nonconforming
structures, see subsection
11-14-3B of this chapter.)
   B.   Reestablishment: A nonconforming use which is destroyed or damaged may
be reestablished. However, if the owner of said damaged/destroyed use proposes
to expand, relocate, or change it, then the other pertinent provisions of this
section shall control. Moreover, if no significant steps have been taken to
reestablish the use within one year from the date the damage occurred, then the
use shall be considered abandoned and subject to the provisions of subsection E
of this section.
   C.   Relocation: A nonconforming use shall not be moved, in whole or in
part, unless, upon relocation, it will conform to all pertinent regulations of
the district in which it will be relocated.
   D.   Change Of Use: A nonconforming use may continue, but shall not be
changed except to a use that is permitted under the applicable district
regulations.
   E.   Discontinuance: When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period
of twelve (12) months, it shall not thereafter be resumed. Any subsequent use
shall conform to the uses permitted in the applicable zone district. (Ord.
1148, 4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)
11-14-5: EXISTING PERMITS:
The regulations of this chapter shall not affect the terms of any permit issued
prior to the effective date hereof or any pertinent amendment hereto; provided,
that the work authorized by such permit is completed within a reasonable time.
(Ord. 1148, 4-27-1987, eff. 6-1-1987)

shall be located outside the limits of the floodplain. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the floodplain if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or structurally dry
floodproofed to the 500-year flood frequency elevation or three feet above the
level of the 100-year flood frequency elevation whichever is greater.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities.
   B.   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as not
to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages. (Ord. 1033, 3-10-
2008)
13-1-10: CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION:
For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained.
In addition, the City of Marion shall notify adjacent communities in writing
thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or
relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 1033, 3-10-2008)
13-1-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the City Planning Commission
for a variance. The City Planning Commission shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Marion City
Council. The Marion City Council may attach such conditions to granting of a
variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   A.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all
of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   The City Planning Commission shall notify an applicant in writing that
a variance from the requirements of the building protections standards of
section
13-1-7 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
13-1-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"Historic Structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
13-1-6 and
13-1-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 1033, 3-10-2008)
13-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the City of Marion or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 1033, 3-10-2008)
13-1-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Marion City Attorney may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
Marion City Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The City of Marion shall make application to the circuit court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order
as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      4.   The City of Marion shall record a notice of violation on the title
of the property.
   B.   The Marion City Attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation
is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
The Marion City Attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the City Planning Commission. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation;
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Planning Commission
shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Marion from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 1033, 3-10-
2008)
13-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other chapter adopted by the Marion City
Council to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including: Amended Ordinance Number 1033 Dated April 13, 1987, Second Amended
Ordinance Number 1033, Dated November 17, 1989, Third Amended Ordinance Number
1033, Dated January 30, 2005. However, this chapter does not repeal the
original resolution or chapter adopted to achieve eligibility in the program.
Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance
easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1033, 3-10-2008)
CHAPTER 2
STORMWATER DETENTION
SECTION:
13-2-1: Purpose And Intent
13-2-2: Application And Jurisdiction
13-2-3: Standards And Requirements
13-2-4: Engineering And Technical Design
13-2-5: Penalties
13-2-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The growth in and around the city and the associated development and
construction of buildings, paved surfaces, roads and other improvements have
altered in the past and continue to alter the natural flow of surface waters on
the land, which, together with the construction of gutters, culverts, drains
and channels for the carrying off of surface waters, have both increased the
quantity of stormwater and amplified the peak flow rates of runoff, thus
leading to present and potential flooding of property and homes, dangerous
flows within and over public roadways and streets, and soil and channel
erosion.
   B.   It is the intention of the city council to protect the health and
safety of the citizens and visitors of the community and to prevent damage to
private property and public facilities through the proper design and
construction of both on site and regional stormwater detention facilities that
prevent or adequately reduce increases in peak flow rates of runoff that may
otherwise increase the risk of flooding and associated risk of public
endangerment, property damage and erosion.
   C.   It is the intention of the city council, through this chapter, to
establish a water detention pond program for the design and construction of
stormwater detention facilities so that, where practical, the most cost
effective protection from flooding may be accomplished.
   D.   It is the intention of the city council to protect the health and
safety of the citizens of and visitors to the community and to prevent damage
to private property and public facilities through the installation and use of
temporary and permanent erosion control practices that prevent or adequately
reduce increases in erosion and siltation that may otherwise increase the risk
of flooding and the associated risk of public endangerment and property damage
by clogging and/or partial filling of constructed or natural drainageways as
well as drainage structures and detention ponds. (Ord. 2212, 7-14-2008)
13-2-2: APPLICATION AND JURISDICTION:
   A.   This chapter shall apply to all property within the corporate city
limits and the one and one-half (1 ½) mile zoning jurisdiction by the city.
   B.   Subsection
13-2-3 B and section
13-2-5  of this chapter shall not apply to:
      1.   Single-family or duplex residential lots of subdivisions approved
prior to the effective date hereof, unless specifically required by prior
agreement between the city and the owners or developers of such subdivisions,
or to new one or two (2) lot subdivisions for single-family or duplex
residential lots, and this chapter is intended to be implemented for entire
subdivisions at the time of platting and construction of streets and drainage
improvements and not on an individual lot basis for single-family and duplex
residential subdivisions.
      2.   Residential lots in the non subdivided areas that create no more
impervious ground cover than twenty percent (20%) of the gross lot surface area
exclusive of any area within the 100- year floodplain.
   C.   The minimum lot threshold shall be as established by the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency, now and as amended. (Ord. 2212, 7-14-2008;
amd. Ord. 3915, 10-9-2023)
13-2-3: STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   It is prohibited to place fill material or construct impervious cover
or construct or place any other structure on a person's property or perform any
excavation or grading in a manner which alters the flow of surface water across
said property in a manner which damages any adjacent property.
No final subdivision plat, subdivision construction plan, or site plan shall be
approved by the city unless it can be demonstrated by the owner or developer of
such property that the proposed development will not result in damage to any
adjacent or downstream property. This will be certified by a professional
engineer's submittal of sufficient data and calculations.
   B.   The requirement of subsection A of this section shall be accomplished
through one of the following means: Design and construction of an on site
stormwater detention facility or facilities by the landowner or developer which
limits the peak flood flows from the proposed development to the existing peak
flood flows from the subject tract.
   C.   Acceptance of requests from the landowner or developer to meet the
stormwater detention requirements through measures listed in subsections A and
B of this section is solely at the discretion of the city and shall not relieve
the owner of responsibility under civil law to adjacent and downstream
properties.
   D.   Acceptance by the city of on site stormwater detention plans will be
based on the suitability and adequacy of the engineering and technical design
of the proposed stormwater detention facility, as described in section
13-2-4 of this chapter. (Ord. 2212, 7-14-2008)
13-2-4: ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL DESIGN:
   A.   A registered professional engineer, licensed in the state of Illinois
and qualified and experienced in the design and operation of stormwater
detention ponds and related stormwater management facilities, shall perform the
hydraulic and structural design of stormwater detention ponds and related
stormwater management facilities, including the development of engineering and
technical information required for evaluation by the city.
   B.   Any design for stormwater detention shall adhere to the planning and
design drainage criteria adopted by the city engineer and approved by the city
council as attached to the ordinance codified herein and made a part hereof.
Such criteria will be available for copy at the office of the city engineer and
the office of the city code enforcement officer.
   C.   All design and technical information necessary to thoroughly evaluate
the suitability and adequacy of the engineering and technical design of
proposed on site stormwater detention facilities and, if proposed, off site
facilities, shall be provided to the city for review. All detention and runoff
calculations, including computer model simulations, if used, shall be provided.
   D.   All on site stormwater detention facilities shall be designed to
adequately and safely pass all stormwater inflows, including flood flows and
runoff from upstream and adjacent properties that have natural and/or existing
overland flows toward and onto the subject tract. The on site stormwater
detention facilities should not impound stormwater onto or cause backwater to
inundate any upstream or adjacent properties in excess of existing conditions.
   E.   On site stormwater detention facilities shall not be placed such that
they encroach into the regulatory 100-year floodplain as established by the
city, and/or the federal emergency management agency, unless it can be
satisfactorily demonstrated to the city through the use of hydraulic modeling
that such encroachment will not cause any rise in the 100-year flood level on
other off site properties or that the increase in the 100-year flood level
caused by such encroachment will occur entirely on site on the owner's or
developer's property.
   F.   Additional engineering and technical rules and guidance with respect to
the application and review of the stormwater detention requirements of this
chapter may be provided by the city. (Ord. 2212, 7-14-2008)
13-2-5: PENALTIES:
   A.   Failure to comply with the terms of this chapter shall result in the
denial of all city building and related permits and refusal to accept
dedication of a plat when proffered.
   B.   Violation of the terms of this chapter may subject the violator to a
fine as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code. (Ord. 2212, 7-14-2008; amd. 2013 Code)
