of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected, and
the word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration

acknowledges that it has read and understands the applicable provisions in
state law (e.g., the Uniform Peace Officers’ Disciplinary Act, 50 ILCS 725/1 et
seq.), the Village’s Police Department General Orders and Procedures and its
collective bargaining agreements that govern conducting internal investigations
for Village Police Department personnel and that failure to comply with the
time periods and notice provisions regarding these internal investigations can
result in Village management being barred from prosecuting a Police Department
employee for misconduct. It is agreed by the OIG and the Village that
investigations of Police Department employees by the OIG are subject to the
applicable internal investigation provisions of state law, the Village Police
Department General Orders and Procedures and its collective bargaining
agreements. In conducting its investigations of alleged misconduct, the OIG

Chief, as warranted and appropriate, including providing information, witness

bargaining agreements.

Attorney’s Office, as warranted and as appropriate. The OIG’s referral of
complaints and information regarding possible misconduct to the President and
Board of Trustees and the Village Manager, as warranted and appropriate, shall

Commissioners Act, 65 ILCS 5/10-2.1 et seq.), the Village’s Personnel Policy
Manual, any department General Orders and Procedures and the Village collective
bargaining agreements.

misconduct.

Board of Trustees and the Village Manager with respect to combating misconduct.
      (6)   To provide periodic reports to the President and Board of Trustees
and the Village Manager as to the status of matters within the scope of OIG’s

facilitate citizen and employee reports of misconduct.

Village Board of Fire and Police Commission arising from disciplinary charges
or actions taken by the Village against a Village employee based upon the
results of an OIG investigation, OIG will fully cooperate with the Village in
the prosecution of the disciplinary action or defense of the grievance
arbitration.

appointed officials, agents, independent contractors to the Village, licensees,
and those doing or seeking to do business with the Village, to cooperate with

      (2)   Subject to federal and state constitutional protections, state law
employment rights, the Village’s Personnel Policy Manual and any applicable
Village collective bargaining agreements, failure of any Village employee or
appointed official to cooperate with OIG in regard to matters covered by this
section shall be considered cause for disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment or removal from office.
      (3)   It shall be the duty of any party doing business with the Village
to likewise cooperate with the OIG in regard to matters covered by this
section. Refusal to so cooperate shall be considered cause for termination of a
contract, license or similar benefit, or as grounds for the Village refusing to
enter into a future contract, license or other benefit.
   (F)   Acknowledgment of duty to cooperate. All contracts for goods and
services, and all future licenses or other benefits issued by the Village after
the effective date of this section shall be subject to the requirement that the

fully comply with requirements of this section relating to cooperation with the
Inspector General’s Office.

§ 32.19 FALSE SECURITY SYSTEM ALARM RATES.
   (A)   In the event that any Village police officer responds to a security
system alarm at any premises in the Village and the responding police officer
or other Police Department personnel determines that the alarm was a false
alarm in that the alarm system was defective or malfunctioned, the alarm was
inadvertently and/or mistakenly activated by an owner, occupant or visitor to
the premises, or was otherwise activated for any other reason other than an
apparent attempt to enter, or entrance, onto the premises by an unauthorized
person, the Police Department shall keep a log of the subject premises address
and the date of each false alarm per month. If police units responding to an
alarm and checking the protected premises, do not discover any evidence of
unauthorized entry, or criminal activity, there shall be a rebuttable
presumption that the alarm is false. Police Department records shall be prima
facie evidence of the facts stated therein with regard to alarms and responses.
   (B)   If the alarm, when communicated to the Police Department before an
officer is dispatched to investigate, is clearly identified to the Department
as resulting from authorized entry, authorized system test or noncriminal
cause, or any other related incident where the system operated properly, it
shall not be considered a false alarm.
   (C)   By the fifteenth day of each month, the Police Department shall submit
to the Village Finance Department a copy of the false alarm log for the
previous month. On a quarterly basis, the Village Finance Department shall send
an invoice to the owner(s) of the subject premises at the owner’s last known
address demanding payment for false alarms in accordance with the following fee
schedule:
      (1)   First 3 false security alarms: no charge;
      (2)   Fourth through seventh false alarm: $75 per false alarm;
      (3)   Each subsequent false alarm: $150 per false alarm.
   (D)   The owner shall pay the full invoice amount to the Village Cashier
within 30 days of the invoice date.
   (E)   If the owner fails to cause the full invoice amount to be paid to the
Village Cashier within 30 days of the invoice date, the Village Finance
Director or the Finance Director’s designee may issue a violation notice
pursuant to Chapter 39 for the owner’s failure to remit payment pursuant to
division (D) of this section.
(40 ILCS 5/22-301 et seq.) (Ord. CO-00-35, passed 12-4-2000; Am. Ord. CO-2013-
33, passed 4-30-2013)
§ 32.20 ADMINISTRATIVE BOOKING FEE.
   An administrative fee of $30 shall be imposed upon an arrestee when posting
bail or bond for any criminal, Village ordinance or other bookable arrest,
including, but not limited to, warrants. The arrestee shall be advised, in
writing, prior to such release, of the following procedure:
   (A)   An administrative booking fee of $30 is imposed upon all persons, who
are processed (photographed or fingerprinted) for any criminal, Village
ordinance or other bookable arrest, to recoup the Police Department’s cost for
that service.
   (B)   The fee must be paid prior to release on bail or bond. In the event
that the individual does not possess sufficient funds to pay the fee, the
individual will be released after being provided a document stating that the
fee is due and owing, and subject to collection. An individual will not be
detained solely for his or her inability to pay the fee.
   (C)   Prior to release, the individual may request to speak with a
supervisor to contest whether or not there was probable cause for the arrest.
   (D)   Refunds.
      (1)   If a court or other adjudicative body finds that there was no
probable cause for the arrest or that the individual was not guilty on all
charges, or if all charges are withdrawn by the prosecuting authority (non-
suit, nolle prosequi, etc.), the individual shall be entitled to a refund of
the fee.
      (2)   A disposition of supervision shall be considered equivalent to a
conviction and not a dismissal of charges.
      (3)   Applications for a refund must be made in writing to the Office of
the Chief of Police within 14 days of the finding or withdrawal of all charges,
as described in division (D)(1) above. The Chief of Police shall designate an
employee to determine the validity of the application. Refund of the fee shall
be without interest.

§ 32.21 AUTHORITY TO DISPOSE OF LOST, STOLEN OR ABANDONED PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   The Law Enforcement Disposition of Property Act (765 ILCS 1030/0.01 et
seq.) (the “Act”) is adopted and incorporated by reference into this section,
and the provisions of the Act shall apply to the disposition of personal
property outlined in this section, except as amended in this section. Where
there is a conflict between the provisions of the Law Enforcement Disposition
of Property Act and the provisions of this section enacted pursuant to the
Village’s home rule authority, the provisions of this section shall control.
   (B)   The Village Police Department may dispose of all personal property of
possessed by it when possession was transferred to the Village Police
Department under circumstances supporting a reasonable belief that such
property was abandoned, lost or stolen or otherwise illegally possessed.
Property seized during a search and retained and ultimately returned, destroyed
or otherwise disposed of pursuant to order of court is not subject to this
section. Property that the Chief of Police reasonably believes was abandoned,
lost or stolen or otherwise illegally possessed, may be disposed pursuant to
the following:
      (1)   Such property shall be retained in custody by the Chief of Police
or his designee, who shall make reasonable inquiry and efforts to identify and
notify the owner or other person, entitled to possession thereof, and shall
return the property after such person provides reasonable and satisfactory
proof of his ownership or right to possession and reimburses the Police
Department for all reasonable expenses of such custody.
      (2)   Weapons that have been confiscated as a result of having been
abandoned or illegally possessed may be transferred, in accordance with written
direction from the Chief of Police, to the Department of State Police for use
by the crime laboratory system, for training purposes, or for any other
application as deemed appropriate by the Department, if no legitimate claim is
made for the confiscated weapon within 6 months of the date of confiscation or
within 6 months of final court disposition if such confiscated weapon was used
for evidentiary purposes.
      (3)   If the identity or location of the owner or other person entitled
to possession of the property has not been ascertained within 6 months after
the Police Department obtains such possession, the Chief of Police shall
effectuate the sale of the property for cash to the highest bidder at a public
auction, notice of which (including time, place and a brief description of such
property) shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general
circulation in Cook County at least 10 days prior to such auction. However, if
the Chief of Police determines that the interests of the public would best be
served thereby, he may donate property that is worth less than $100, if the
donation is approved by the Board of Trustees, to a charitable organization,
rather than effectuating the sale of the property by public auction.
      (4)   Property offered but not sold at such public auction may be offered
and sold at a subsequent public auction without further published notice.
      (5)   Proceeds of the sale of the property at public auction shall be
deposited in the treasury of the Village for the use and benefit of the
operation of the Police Department.
      (6)   The owner or other person entitled to possession of such property
may claim and recover possession of the property at any time before its sale at
public auction, upon providing reasonable and satisfactory proof of ownership
or right to possession and reimbursing the Police Department for all reasonable
expenses of custody thereof.
      (7)   Paper currency or coins that hold no historical or monetary value
other than the value indicated on the face of such currency, that the Police
Department has obtained and reasonably believes to be abandoned, lost or stolen
or otherwise illegally possessed, shall not be subject to the auction
provisions of division (B)(3) above. The Chief of Police shall make a
reasonable inquiry to identify and notify the owner or other person entitled to
possession of the paper currency or coins. If the identity or location of the
owner or other person entitled to possession of the currency or coins has not
been ascertained within 6 months after the Police Department obtains possession
of the currency or coins, the Chief of Police shall deposit the paper currency
or coins in the treasury of the Village, for the use and benefit of the
operation of the Police Department.
      (8)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a written record of all personal
property retained and disposed of by the Police Department under this section,
which shall include:
         (a)   A complete inventory of the personal property, including a
picture and brief description of each item or group of items;
         (b)   All efforts to identify and notify the owner or other person
entitled to possession of such personal property;
         (c)   All claims made by any person that they are the owner or are
otherwise entitled to the possession of such personal property;
         (d)   All auctions for the sale of such personal property, including
the date, time, location and outcome of said auctions; and
         (e)   The amount of proceeds deposited into the treasury of the
Village by the Police Department from the sale of such personal property.
      (9)   The Chief of Police shall provide a monthly report to the Village
President and Board of Trustees summarizing any updates to the records required
under division (B)(8) above.
      (10)   No person shall be responsible for consequential damages to
another occasioned by an act or omission in compliance with this section.

   (A)   In the event that any Village police officer or firefighter responds
to a fire alarm at any premises in the Village and the responding police

§ 34.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   Since it is the policy of the United States government to insure the maximum
participation of all available workers in production, regardless of race,
creed, color, national origin or ancestry, in the firm belief that the
democratic way of life within the nation can be defended successfully only with
the help and support of all groups within its borders, including the Village,
by eliminating possible discrimination in public and private employment, the
Board of Trustees of the Village, in furtherance of this democratic objective,
enacts this chapter to be known as the “Fair Employment Practices Ordinance.”

handicap unrelated to ability; to discriminate for the same reasons in regard
to tenure, terms or conditions of employment; to deny promotion or increase in

physical or mental handicap unrelated to ability;

The President and Board of Trustees, as part of the Village’s annual budget,
may establish and allocate an amount of money for use by the individual
Trustees and President in support of events, activities, and charities
organized by, sponsored by, or conducted by nonprofit organizations or
businesses that support or benefit the Village as a whole, so long as such
events, activities, and charities are not political or campaign-related in
nature or otherwise for a principally private purpose, and are authorized in
accordance with the Village’s expense approval policy. Such money may also be
used in accordance with the Village’s travel policy by the individual Trustees
and President for travel on an annual basis in attending up to 4 municipal
conferences, meetings, seminars or training sessions outside of the Maywood
Metropolitan Area (Cook, DuPage, Will, Lake, Kane and McHenry Counties) per
year, unless additional trips are approved in advance by the Village Board of
Trustees, and to pay business expenses that are directly related to the

   (C)   Expense approval policy and reimbursements.
      (1)   Any expenses other than travel to be paid from the budget
allocation made pursuant to division (A) above may be made only in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures for pre-approval and reimbursement set forth
in the “Village of Maywood expense approval policy” as approved and modified

§ 36.07 INVESTMENT AND FISCAL POLICY FOR THE VILLAGE.
   (A)   Purpose.  The investment and fiscal policy (the "policy") sets forth
the investment objectives, goals and guidelines for the Village of Maywood (the
"Village") in order to provide for the greatest degree of safety of principal
and liquidity of funds and to comply with Section 2.5 of the Public Funds
Investment Act, 30 ILCS 235/2.5 (the "Investment Act"), other state and federal
laws and local ordinances. This policy applies to all financial assets of the
Village and includes investment objectives, standard of care, diversification,
safekeeping, institutional qualification, collateralization, reporting
personnel qualifications and tax levy requirements.
   (B)   Objectives. The objectives, in order of priority, of the Village's
investment activities shall be:
      (1)   Safety. Investments of the Village shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. This
includes mitigation of credit risk and interest risk and diversification so
that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income
generated from the remainder of the portfolio.
      (2)   Liquidity. The Village's investment portfolio shall remain
sufficiently liquid to enable the Village to meet all operating requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. The portfolio will be structured so that
securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands.
Furthermore, since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the
portfolio shall consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale
markets. A portion of the portfolio also may be placed in money market mutual
funds or local government investment pools that offer same-day liquidity for
short-term funds.
      (3)   Return on investment. The Village's investment portfolio shall be
designed with the objective of achieving a rate of return during budgetary and
economic periods commensurate with the Village's risk constraints and liquidity
requirements. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the
safety and liquidity objectives described above. Securities shall not be sold
prior to maturity with the following exceptions:
         (a)   A declining credit security may be sold early to minimize loss
or principal.
         (b)   A security swap would improve the quality, yield or target
duration of the portfolio.
         (c)   Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be
sold.
   (C)   Standards of care.
      (1)   Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by the Village
Treasurer and Finance Director shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall
be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Each such Village
official acting in accordance with written procedures and this policy and
exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an
individual security's credit risk or market price changes provided deviations
from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the
sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy.
Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in
the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment,
considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income
to be derived.
      (2)   Ethics; conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with proper execution of the Village's investment program or that
could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the Village Treasurer and Finance
Director any material financial interests in financial institutions that
conduct business within this jurisdiction, and they shall further disclose any
large personal financial or investment positions that could be related to the
performance of the Village, particularly with regard to the time of purchases
and sales.
      (3)   Delegation of authority.  
         (a)   Both the Finance Director and the Village Treasurer (or their
designee) shall serve as the investment officers of the Village. The Finance
Director shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment
program consistent with this policy. Procedures shall include reference to
safekeeping, wire transfer agreements, banking service contracts and
collateral/depository agreements. Such procedures shall include explicit
delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No
person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the
terms of this policy and the procedures established by the Village Treasurer,
the Finance Director and approved by the Village Manager. The Village Treasurer
and the Finance Director shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken
and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of
subordinate officials. In the even of a disagreement with respect to an
investment decision or transaction between the Village Treasurer and the
Finance Director, the Finance Director's decision shall control, unless
directed otherwise by the Village Board.
         (b)   The Village Treasurer and Finance Director may seek advice on
investments from other sources (for example, local bankers, brokers, and other
investment professionals) as provided in this policy. When selecting investment
advisors, the Village Treasurer and Finance Director shall carefully review the
credentials, procedures, and controls of the firms offering the services. All
investment decisions must be based upon the objectives as prioritized herein.
   (D)   Investment instruments. The following investments are authorized under
this policy in accordance with the Investment Act:
      (1)   Non-negotiable certificates of deposit and other collateralized
evidence of deposits with qualified public depositories;
      (2)   Obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and
instrumentalities. However, this authorization shall specifically exclude
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs), Real Estate Mortgage Investment
Conduits (REMICs), and other Principal Only (Pos) and Interest Only (Ios)
obligations that are secured with mortgages issued by any federal agency,
instrumentality or private firm;
      (3)   Prime bankers' acceptances purchased on the secondary marked with
ratings of A1/P1;
      (4)   Repurchase agreements for securities listed above, provided the
transaction is structured so that the Village obtains control over the
underlying securities and a Master Repurchase Agreement has been signed with
the bank or dealer;
      (5)   State of Illinois Treasurer's Investment Pool;
      (6)   Bonds of the State of Illinois and any local government in the
State of Illinois, which bonds have at the time of investment, one of the three
highest credit ratings of a nationally recognized rating agency; and
      (7)   Any other investment authorized by the Investment Act.
   (E)   Diversification and maturities of investments. 
      (1)   Diversification. In order to reduce institutional risk on the
Village's capital and to provide competitive bidding benefits, investments
should be placed in various financial institutions. A diversification of
investment instruments is encouraged to give the Village more flexibility and
help minimize the impact of market fluctuations. Investment instruments not
subject to credit risks (such as Treasury bills and certificates of deposit)
need not be subjected to diversification requirements.
      (2)   Maturities. To the extent possible, the Village will attempt to
match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched
to a specific cash flow, the Village will not directly invest in securities
maturing more than 3 years from the date of purchase. A careful analysis of the
Village's short-, mid-, and long-term cash needs should be made when planning
maturities. Reserve or capital improvement project funds may be invested in
securities not to exceed 5 years, or less if subject to federal arbitrage rules
with respect to the use of proceeds of tax-exempt bonds. The maturity of such
investments is made to coincide as nearly as possible with the expected use of
funds.
   (F)   Safekeeping; custody. 
      (1)   Authorized financial institutions. 
         (a)   Qualified and licensed financial institutions shall be selected
which qualify as depositories or custodians under Illinois law. In making these
selections, the Village shall consider the financial stability and strength of
the institution and the availability of financial data regarding the
institution. For additional requirements, see division (G) of this section.
         (b)   If a competitive rate is offered by a local banking institution,

be substantiated by a monthly account analysis (and shall be reimbursed by
means of compensating balances).
      (2)   Authorized investment advisors.
         (a)   The Village Treasurer or Finance Director, with the consent and
approval of the President and Board of Trustees of the Village (the "Village
Board") may appoint investment advisors. The investment advisor shall be a
fiduciary with respect to the security decisions and shall be one of the
following:
            1.   Investment advisor registered under the federal Investment
Advisors Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-1, et seq.) and the Illinois Security
Law of 1953;
            2.   Bank or trust company authorized to conduct a trust business
in Illinois;
            3.   Life insurance company authorized to transact business in
Illinois;
            4.   Investment company as defined and registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. §§ 80A-1, et seq.) and registered
under the Illinois Security Law of 1953.
         (b)   The investment advisor shall be a person who:
            1.   Has the power to manage, acquire, or dispose of any security;
            2.   Acknowledges in writing that he is a fiduciary with respect to
the Village's securities; and

written reports, on at least a quarterly basis, for regularly scheduled
meetings of the Village Board. All returns on investments shall be reported as
net returns after payment of all fees, commissions and any other compensation.
      (3)   Internal controls. The Finance Director is responsible for
establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure
that the assets of the Village are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The
internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance
that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes
that (i) the cost of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be
derived, and (ii) the valuation of costs and benefits will require estimates
and judgments by management. To protect against potential fraud, embezzlement,
or losses caused by collapse of individual securities' dealers, all investment
securities purchase by the Village, including collateral on repurchase
agreements, shall be held by the Village or in safekeeping by the Village's
custodial bank or a third party bank trust department, acting as agent for the
Village under the terms of a custody or trustee agreement executed by the bank
or the Village. The primary agent shall issue a safekeeping receipt to the
Village listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity, or other pertinent
information. All securities' transactions conducted by the custodian on behalf
of the Village are to be on a delivery-versus payment (DVP) only basis.

possible embezzlement and malfeasance.

      (3)   Investments may be made only in those savings and loan associations
which are insured by the Savings Association Insurance Funds of the F.D.I.C.
      (4)   No savings and loan association shall receive public funds unless

Associations or the Federal Home Loan Bank.
      (5)   All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become

         (d)   State of Illinois Obligations of the State of Illinois.

      (1)   Investment Portfolio Reporting.
         (a)   Method. The Village Board shall receive a monthly report from
the Village Treasurer and the Finance Director on the state of the investment
portfolio. In addition, a comprehensive annual investment report should be
prepared. This report shall provide a review of the performance of the
Village's investment portfolio for the year and include a projection of future
performance based upon the prior year's results.
         (b)   Performance. The investment portfolio will be managed in
accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio
should obtain a market average rate of return during a market/economic
environment of stable interest rates. The portfolio should be compared to the
market average rate on a regular basis.
      (2 )   Balanced budget. The Village shall operate within a balanced
budget (as defined herein) in each fiscal year. Not later than 45 days before

but not paid until the current fiscal year) is reflected in such budget as an
expense which is offset by a corresponding prior year fund balance relating to
such expense included in such budget.
      (3)   Financial reports. In addition to other financial reports required
to be prepared for the Village Board, the Finance Director shall provide or
cause to be provided to the Village Board these additional financial reports:

such fiscal year, setting forth in each case in comparative form the
corresponding figures as of the end of and for the preceding fiscal year, all
in reasonable detail and duly certified as correct by the Finance Director,
together with a certificate of the Finance Director stating that to their
knowledge no default or event of default on the Village's bonds has occurred,
and is continuing or, if a default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing, a statement setting forth the details of such default or event of
default and the action which the Village proposes to take with respect to such
default or event of default;
         (b)   Within 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of the
statement of financial position of the Village as of the end of such fiscal
year, and the related statements of activities and changes in net assets,
functional expenses and cash flows of the Village for such fiscal year, all in
reasonable detail and stating in comparative form the figures as of the end of
and for the previous fiscal year, audited or reviewed by the Village Auditor.
      (4)   Budget monitoring.
         (a)   Monthly. The Finance Director shall prepare monthly and
quarterly reports comparing the actual revenues and expenses with the budgeted
revenues and expenses (a budget-to-actual cash flow statement). By the twenty-
first day of each month, the Finance Director shall prepare a budget-to-actual
report for such month for (i) all funds of the Village, taken together, (ii)
the Village’s Water and Sewer Fund, and (iii) the Village’s Garbage Fund. Prior
to the second meeting of the Village Board during such month (or if the second
meeting of the Board precedes the twenty-first day, at the first meeting of the
Village Board during the next month), the Fiscal Accountability and Government
Transparency Committee shall meet to review the monthly budget-to-actual cash
flow statement with the Finance Director. At the second meeting of the Village
Board during such month (or if no meeting is held, at the first meeting held by
the Village Board during the next month) the Finance Director or Fiscal
Accountability and Government Transparency Committee shall report to the
Village Board with respect to such monthly budget-to-actual cash flow statement
and the proposed action, if any, to be taken by the Village with respect to the
remainder of the then current fiscal year as a result of such monthly budget-
to-actual cash flow statement.
         (b)   Quarterly. By the thirtieth day of the month following the end
of each fiscal quarter, the Finance Director shall submit to the Village Board
a report showing the actual versus budgeted revenues and expenses for such
fiscal quarter (a "quarterly budget-to-actual cash flow statement").
   (J)   Village management; Finance Department.
      (1)   Village Manager. The Village shall at all times retain a Village
Manager with the following qualifications: a Bachelor of Arts or Science degree

Administration and not less than 5 years' experience in management in
government, or (ii) not less than 7 years' experience in management in
government.
      (2)   Finance Director. The Village shall at all times retain a Finance
Director with the following qualifications: either (i) a Bachelor of Arts or

shall prohibit the Village from retaining a firm selected by the Village to
provide the functions of a Finance Department if the quality and quantity of
employees of such firm otherwise satisfy this division (J)(3).
      (4)   Vacancy in position. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village
shall, upon the resignation or dismissal of the Village Manager or Finance
Director, retain a person meeting the applicable requirements set forth above
to fill such vacant position (including in the capacity of Acting Village
Manager or Acting Finance Director, as appropriate) within 90 days of the date
such position is vacated.
   (K)   Indemnification. The Village Treasurer and Finance Director, who are
responsible for the investment program, assume a unique responsibility for not
only realizing an acceptable rate of return on the monies invested, but also
safeguarding the monies against loss. The very nature of this responsibility
exposes the Village Treasurer and Finance Director to certain risks. The
Village Treasurer and Finance Director, acting in accordance with this policy,
shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's
credit risk or market price changes provided that deviations from expectation
are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control
adverse developments.
   (L)   Working Capital Reserve Fund.
      (1)   The Village shall establish a Working Capital Reserve Fund (the
“Fund”) for the purpose of enabling the Village to have in its treasury at all
times sufficient money to meet demands thereon for ordinary and necessary
expenditures for corporate purposes, and shall at all times maintain a balance
of $2,000,000, except for time periods in which the Village has received moneys
transferred from the Fund for the uses as stated herein and is waiting for the
receipt of semi-annual property tax collections or other moneys to repay such
funds as set forth below. Moneys in the Fund shall not be regarded as current
assets available for Village purposes. The Village Board may appropriate moneys
to the Fund up to the maximum amount allowable in the Fund, and the Fund may
receive such appropriations and any other contributions.
      (2)   Moneys in the Fund shall not be used by the Village Board in any
manner other than to provide moneys with which to meet ordinary and necessary
disbursements for salaries, operating expenses and other Village purposes, and
may be transferred, in whole or in part, to the general corporate fund or
another fund of the Village and disbursed therefrom in anticipation of the
collection of taxes lawfully levied for any or all purposes. Moneys so
transferred to any other fund shall be deemed to be transferred in anticipation
of the collection of that part of the taxes so levied or to be received, and
such taxes when collected shall be applied to the reimbursement of the Fund.
Upon receipt by the Village of any taxes, in anticipation of the collection
whereof, moneys of the Fund have been so transferred for disbursement, the Fund
shall immediately be reimbursed therefrom until the full amount so transferred
has been retransferred to the Fund.

§ 36.08 CONTRACTS AND PURCHASES.
   (A)   Competitive bidding procedures.
      (1)   Competitive bidding required. Any work or other public improvement
which is not to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessment and all
purchases of, and contracts for supplies, materials and services shall, except
as specifically provided herein, be based whenever possible on competitive
bids.
      (2)   Formal contracts.
         (a)   All work or other public improvement which is not to be paid for
in whole or in part by special assessment, except as otherwise provided herein,
when the estimated cost thereof shall exceed $20,000 shall be purchased by
formal, written contract from the lowest qualified and responsible bidder,
after due notice inviting bids, unless competitive bidding is waived by a vote
of 2/3 of the corporate authorities.
         (b)   All single purchases of, and individual contracts for supplies,
materials and/or services, except as otherwise provided herein, when the
estimated cost thereof shall exceed $10,000, shall be purchased by formal
written contract from the lowest qualified and responsible bidder, after due
notice inviting bids, unless competitive bidding is waived by a vote of 2/3 of
the corporate authorities. When no single purchase of or individual contract
for, specific types of supplies, materials or services exceeds $10,000, but the
total dollar value of all purchases and/or contracts for said specific types of
supplies, materials or services during the Village’s fiscal year does exceed
said amount, said purchases and/or contracts shall be handled as set forth in
division (C) of this section, at the lowest obtainable price, from the most
qualified, responsible contractor/vendor. It is not the intent of this division
to encourage the circumvention of the bidding requirements and, to the extent
practicable, Village staff is encouraged to rely upon the competitive bidding
process. Rather, the competitive bidding exemption provided by this division is
intended to recognize and address those situations in which a competitive
bidding requirement is not necessarily practicable, and can be eliminated
without jeopardizing the Village’s ability to obtain a low and competitive
price from a qualified responsible contractor/vendor. Except for items or
services routinely used in the course of Village business on a frequent basis
purchased from one supplier.
      (3)   Notice inviting bids.
         (a)   Publication. Notice inviting bids shall be published at least
once in a newspaper with a general circulation within the Village. The
newspaper notice required herein shall include a general description of the
work to be performed or the articles to be purchased, shall state where
specifications may be secured, the time, place and manner for submitting a bid,
and the time and place for opening bids.
         (b)   Posting. The Village shall also advertise all pending work or
purchases by posting a notice on the public bulletin board in the Village Hall
and at Council Chambers.
         (c)   These posting requirements shall also include the information
required under division (D) of this section.
      (4)   Bid deposits. When deemed necessary by the President and Board of
Trustees, bid deposits shall be prescribed in the public notices inviting bids.
Unsuccessful bidders shall be entitled to the return of their bid deposit upon
the award of the contract by the President and Board of Trustees. A successful
bidder shall forfeit any bid deposit required by the President and Board of
Trustees upon failure on his or her part to enter into a contract within 10
days after the award.
      (5)   Performance bonds. The Village Manager shall have the authority to
require performance bonds before allowing the Village to enter into a contract
in such an amount as he or she shall find reasonable and necessary to protect
the best interests of the Village. Such performance bonds will be required for
all contracts involving public improvements or purchases where materials and
labor are involved. On purchases of material only, a warranty will be required
for the specific use of the material.
      (6)   Submittal and award of bids.
         (a)   Bids shall be submitted to the Village and shall be identified
as bids on the envelope. Bids should include information relevant to the
considerations set forth in subdivision (e) below, including information on
whether the bidder is a Minority Business Enterprise, Women's Business
Enterprise, or Persons with Disability Enterprise (MBE/WBE/PBE) or will use
MBE, WBE, or PBE subcontractors. For the purpose of determining whether a
bidder qualifies as a MBE, WBE, or PBE, the Village adopts the definitions
contained in Section 2 of the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Females, and
Persons with Disabilities Act (30 ILCS 575/2), including the definitions
contained therein of the terms minority person, female, person with a
disability, minority owned business, female owned business, and business owned
by a person with a disability. Proof of current certification as a MBE/WBE/PBE
through the State Business Enterprise Program for Minorities, Females, and
Persons with Disabilities, or similar certification with Cook County, the City
of Chicago, the Chicago Minority Business Development Council, Women's Business
Development Center or the Illinois Department of Transportation or other
similar federal, state or county agency should accompany all bids for which
qualification as a MBE/WBE/PBE is sought.
         (b)   Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in
the public notices, and conform to the requirements of division (D) of this
section.
         (c)   A tabulation of all bids received shall be made by the Village
Manager, Finance Director, or their designee and the tabulation of the bids
with a recommendation from Village staff shall be furnished to the President
and Board of Trustees at its next regular meeting.
         (d)   The President and Board of Trustees shall have the sole
authority to reject all bids or parts of all bids. The Village shall not accept
the bid of a contractor who is in default on the payment of taxes, licenses or
other monies due the Village, the County of Cook or the State of Illinois.
         (e)   The President and Board of Trustees shall have the authority to
award contracts within the purview of this section. Unless rejected in whole or
in part, contracts shall be awarded to the lowest qualified and responsible
bidder on the basis of the bid that is in the best interest of the Village to
accept. In awarding a contract, in addition to price, the President and Board
of Trustees shall consider any 1 or more of the following items for purposes of
determining the lowest qualified and responsible bidders:
            1.   The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract to provide the service required;

Village.
   (C)   If any retailer located in the Village shall receive or otherwise
obtain alcoholic beverages upon which the tax imposed herein has not been
collected by any wholesale alcoholic beverage dealer, then the retailer shall
collect such tax and remit it directly to the Village Finance Department within

remit it to the Village Finance Department in the same manner as sales to
retail alcoholic beverage dealers.
(1997 Code, § 51.05)
§ 36.25 REPORT OF SALES.

the Village by a wholesale alcoholic beverage dealer.

§ 36.27 PURCHASER’S DUTY TO PAY TAX.

the tax herein imposed shall not relieve the purchaser of his duty to pay it.

the purchaser shall be required to pay it directly to the Finance Department in
the same mariner and form as a retail alcoholic beverage dealer.
(1997 Code, § 51.08)
§ 36.28 REMITTING TAXES; DEALER’S COMMISSION.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any wholesale or retail
alcoholic beverage dealer filing a return under this chapter shall, at the time

imposed by this chapter less a commission of 1% of the tax remitted which is
allowed to reimburse the alcoholic beverage dealer for the expenses incurred in
collecting the tax, keeping records, preparing and filing returns, remitting
the tax, and supplying data to the Finance Department upon request. The
commission shall not be allowed, however, on any taxes not remitted when due.
The Director may also appoint one or more persons within or without the Village

collection agents shall be the same as that provided for wholesale or retail
alcoholic beverage dealers.

§ 36.29 EXCEPTIONS TO TAX.

company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered TELECOMMUNICATIONS
subject to the tax imposed under this subchapter. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section

retailer.

extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state
which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local

be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this subchapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this subchapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this subchapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.

Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, Section 5-50) (35 ILCS

to implement the Act.

§ 36.49 RESELLERS.
   (A) If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a
reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the Department
for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the
Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this
subchapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

time frame otherwise indicated.
   (A)   Interest. The Village hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be 5%
per annum, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.

the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return
shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall be
imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the Village issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.
(Ord. CO-01-04, passed 1-11-2001)
§ 36.111 ABATEMENT.
   The Local Tax Administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any

§ 36.112 INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.
   The Village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The Local Tax
Administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
Local Tax Administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14 working day period or fails to demonstrate
good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the Local Tax
Administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without further
notice to the taxpayer.
(Ord. CO-01-04, passed 1-11-2001)
§ 36.113 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   The Village, through the Local Tax Administrator, shall review all tax

reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still
due and owing.
   (A)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than 4 years
after then end of the calendar year for which the return for the applicable
period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for the
applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any 4-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the Village,
the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations shall
be 6 years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which return for the
applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was filed.
   (C)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer.
(Ord. CO-01-04, passed 1-11-2001)
§ 36.114 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than 4 years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before
the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the fling of the voluntary
disclosure application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator.
However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and
interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a
final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount
owed or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer.
(Ord. CO-01-04, passed 1-11-2001)
§ 36.115 PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES.
   Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk's office.
(Ord. CO-01-04, passed 1-11-2001)
§ 36.116 INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   The Local Tax Administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the Local Tax Administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the Local Tax Administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the Village's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

Coordinator-Chief shall report to the Village Manager for purposes of handling
day-to-day administrative activities and matters. The Coordinator-Chief shall
assist in the coordination of all the Village’s department resources (Police,

constraints of the Village and the annual budget, the Coordinator-Chief shall

organization shall, before entering upon his duties, execute a written oath in
substantially the form set forth in Section 20 of the Act (20 ILCS 3305/20),
before the Coordinator-Chief or other person authorized to administer oaths in
the state (20 ILCS 3305/20). The oath shall be filed with the Coordinator-

authorized to designate space in a Village building, or elsewhere, as may be
provided for by the Village President and Board of Trustees, for the DHSEM as
its office.

updating the Village’s Emergency Operations Plan, which plan shall be approved
by resolution of the President and Board of Trustees.
   (G)   Service as mobile support team. All or any members of the DHSEM
organization may be designated as members of a mobile support team created by
the Director of the IEMA as provided by law, to aid and to reinforce the IEMA
and emergency services and disaster agencies in areas stricken by disaster.
Personnel of a mobile support team, while on duty pursuant to such a call or
while engaged in regularly scheduled training exercises, shall, if they are an
employee of the Village, have the powers, duties, rights, privileges and
immunities, and receive the compensation incidental to their employment, and if
not an employee of the Village, shall be entitled to at least $1 per year
compensation from the state.
   (H)   Emergency action. A proclamation of a disaster by the Governor shall
activate the State Emergency Operations Plan and the Village’s Emergency

be made available under the Act (20 ILCS 3305/1 et seq.) or other provision of
law relating to disasters.

disaster. It shall not be continued or renewed for a period in excess of 7 days
except by or with the consent of the Board of Trustees. Any order or
proclamation declaring, continuing, or terminating a local disaster shall be
given prompt and general publicity and shall be filed promptly with the Village
Clerk. The effect of a declaration of a local disaster is to activate the
emergency operations plan of the DHSEM and to authorize the furnishing of aid
and assistance thereunder.
   (J)   Mutual aid agreements. The Coordinator-Chief of the DHSEM may, in
collaboration with other public agencies within the immediate vicinity, develop
or cause to be developed mutual aid arrangements with other political
subdivisions in the state for reciprocal disaster response and recovery
assistance in case a disaster is too great to be dealt with unassisted. The
mutual aid shall not, however, be effective unless and until approved by each
of the political subdivisions. The arrangements shall be consistent with the
State Emergency Operations Plan and state emergency management program, and, in
the event of a disaster, it shall be the duty of each emergency management
agency to render assistance in accordance with the provisions of the mutual aid
agreements.

to the appropriate fund, any reimbursement by the state to the Village for

position to effectively combat any disaster, as defined in Section 4 of the Act

event of a disaster, the Village President and Board of Trustees may exercise
the above powers, in the light of the exigencies of the disaster and, excepting
mandatory constitutional requirements, without regard to the procedures and
formalities normally prescribed by law pertaining to the performance of public
work, entering into contracts, the incurring of obligations, the employment of
temporary workers, the rental of equipment, the purchase of supplies and
materials, and the appropriation, expenditure, and disposition of public funds
and property, as authorized by Section 10(j) of the Act (20 ILCS 3305/10(j)).
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the Village
President’s authority to apply for, administer and expend grants, gifts or
payments in aid of disaster mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.

office of Village President, may, by executive order and without the approval
of the Board of Trustees, exercise such powers of the corporate authorities,
including spending up to $50,000 in Village funds, as may be reasonably

Tem, or emergency interim successor may not exercise the emergency spending
authority granted herein without first declaring that an emergency, as defined
above, exists, by setting forth, in writing and under oath, a declaration of
emergency describing the nature of the emergency and detailing facts to
substantiate such finding. The declaration of emergency shall be filed with the
Village Clerk as soon as is practicable. The declaration of emergency, and
concurrent spending and other authority, shall expire not later than the
adjournment of the first regular meeting of the corporate authorities after the
state of emergency is declared.

§ 38.05 CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   The Village Board of Trustees has adopted a written policy governing

issued to the Village, cardholder limits, telephone, facsimile and internet
orders, documentation, card restrictions, reconciliation and payment, disputes,
lost or stolen cards, terminated/resigning employees and officials, reporting
requirements in regard to credit card usage to the Finance Committee and Board
of Trustees, and policy violations and penalties. Village credit cards shall
only be used in conformance with the adopted policy, a copy of which is
available from the Village Clerk’s Office, the Village Mayor’s Office or the
Finance Department, or the Village’s website. The policy may be amended from

   (A)   Incorporation. The Village incorporates by reference the provisions of
the Illinois Local Governmental Acceptance of Credit Cards Act (50 ILCS 345/
1 et seq.) (the "Act"), as amended, into this section. The corporate
authorities of the Village held a public hearing on November 14, 2016, as
required by the Act, for the purpose of making a determination of whether to
enact rules to allow the Village to accept payment by credit cards for all
"authorized obligations" (as defined in the Act), such as any fine, fee,
charge, tax, or cost imposed by, owing to, or collected by the Village. The
corporate authorities of the Village passed Ordinance No. CO-2016-24 on
November 14, 2016, that amended the Code to enact this section.
   (B)   Definition of credit card. The Act defines CREDIT CARD as “an
instrument or device, whether known as a credit card, bank card, charge card,
debit card, automated teller machine card, secured credit card, smart card,
electronic purse, prepaid card, affinity card, or by any other name, issued
with or without fee by an issuer for the use of the holder to obtain credit,
money, goods, services, or anything else of value.”
   (C)   Policy regarding acceptance of credit cards. The Village
Administrative Policy Regarding Acceptance of Payments By Credit Cards (the
"Policy") (a copy of which was attached as Exhibit "A" to Ordinance No. CO-
2016-24 and made a part thereof) and any future amendments to the policy are
incorporated into this section by reference without further action by the
corporate authorities of the Village. The policy contains the rules governing
the manner of acceptance of payments by credit cards for all "authorized
obligations" (as defined in the Act), such as any fine, fee, charge, tax, or
cost imposed by, owing to, or collected by the Village. The Village Manager is
authorized to approve and enact any amendments to the Policy that are
consistent with or necessary to comply with the Act. A copy of the policy is
available from the Village Clerk's Office upon request.

any reportable offense under § 6-204 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/

   (B)   The establishment of the Village of Maywood Ordinance Enforcement
Department does not preclude the Village from using any other method to enforce
municipal ordinances of the Village.
   (C)   The provisions of Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/1-2.1-1 et seq.)
are adopted and incorporated into this chapter as if fully set forth herein.
(Ord. CO-03-11, passed 4-21-2003)
§ 39.03 APPLICATION.

   (A)   Unless otherwise provided by law or rule, a notice of violation or
notice of hearing shall be served upon the alleged violator no less than 7
calendar days prior to the date of the hearing by:
      (1)   Certified mail, return receipt requested at the violator’s
residence address or, if the violator is a business entity, at any address

alleged violator is the owner or manager of the property, by posting a copy of
the notice of violation on the front entrance of the building or other

or other agent, present witnesses, and cross-examine opposing witnesses.
Parties may request the administrative Hearing Officer to issue subpoenas as
provided for in § 39.12.

been authorized by the respondent to represent the respondent at the hearing.
   (D)   The Village shall not be represented by an employee or other
representative of the Ordinance Enforcement Department; provided, however, that
documentary evidence, prepared by another department of the Village and
submitted to the Ordinance Enforcement Department, may be presented at the
hearing by the administrative Hearing Officer.
   (E)   All administrative hearings shall be conducted on the date set for
hearing. A continuance may be granted for good cause shown at the discretion of
the Hearing Officer. The purpose of administrative hearings is to provide a
prompt resolution of alleged Code violations, and accordingly, the request for,
and granting of, continuances shall be curtailed to the extent fairness
permits. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance.
   (F)   All testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation.
   (G)   The Hearing Officer may issue subpoenas pursuant to § 39.12.
   (H)   The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in the

is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct
of their affairs.
   (I)   No violation may be established except upon proof by a preponderance
of the evidence; provided, however, that the original or a legible copy of the
notice of violation, issued in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this chapter, shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts
specified therein.
   (J)   It shall not be a defense that a compliance violation has been
corrected prior to adjudication of the charge.
   (K)   The record of all hearings before a Hearing Officer shall include:
      (1)   A record of the testimony presented at the hearing, which may be
made by tape recording or other appropriate means;

      (4)   A copy of the findings and decision of the Hearing Officer.
   (L)   Recording by any means by any member of the public is prohibited
unless expressly authorized. However, any party may request that the
proceedings be taken and transcribed by a certified court reporter. The cost of
the reporter shall be borne by the party requesting the court reporter.
   (M)   At the conclusion of a hearing, the Hearing Officer shall issue his
final determination. Based on the notice of violation and the evidence
admitted, the Hearing Officer may issue the following determination: liable,
not liable, or liable upon a plea or plea of no contest. The Hearing Officer
also may dismiss the case with or without prejudice or grant a properly made
motion by the Village voluntarily dismissing the case. If the Hearing Officer
issues a final determination of liability, he may impose fines, assess costs
and make specific orders to correct violations, all as are consistent with the
specific Code provision(s) found to have been violated.
   (N)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall inform the
parties orally and in writing of his determination. Except as specified in this
subsection, that determination constitutes a final determination for purposes
of judicial review and is subject to review under the Illinois Administrative
Review Law. Where a person fails to appear at the administrative hearing to
contest the alleged violation on the date and at the time and place specified
in a prior served or mailed notice pursuant to §
39.07, the Hearing Officer’s determination of liability shall become final
either upon a denial of a timely petition to set aside that default order, or
upon the expiration of the period for filing such a petition without a filing
having been made.

   Any person, having received notice and an opportunity for a hearing as
provided in this chapter, who knowingly fails to comply with an order issued by
an administrative Hearing Officer under this chapter, including the issuance of
a subpoena, shall, if the order is not stayed by a court of competent
jurisdiction prior to its effective date, be guilty of contempt. Contempt shall
be enforceable only by the Cook County judicial system and shall be punishable
by applicable law. Each day that the violation continues shall be considered a
separate and distinct offense. In a prosecution under this section, it shall
not be a defense that a person came into compliance with an order, sought
judicial review of it, or made efforts to comply with an order, subsequent to
its effective date.
(Ord. CO-03-11, passed 4-21-2003)
§ 39.10 DEFAULTS.
   (A)   If on the date set for hearing the respondent, or his attorney or
agent of record, fails to appear, the Hearing Officer shall proceed with the
hearing and accept evidence relevant to the issue of liability and may enter a
default finding against the respondent as to the existence of a Code violation,

service of a notice of violation permitted by this chapter and applicable to
the violation.

decision.
(Ord. CO-03-11, passed 4-21-2003)
§ 39.11 PETITION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT ORDER.
   (A)   A respondent against whom an order of default is entered may file a
motion with the Ordinance Enforcement Department to set aside the order of
default and for a new hearing date. A motion to set aside an order of default
must be filed within 21 days from the date of mailing or other service.
   (B)   A motion to set aside an order of default shall set forth the reason
(s) the respondent failed to appear on the original hearing date. A Hearing
Officer shall hear and rule on the motion. If the Hearing Officer determines
that the respondent's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause and
grants the motion, a hearing will be held immediately on the alleged Code
violation set forth in the notice of violation unless the respondent requests
another hearing date and presents a showing of good cause for continuing the
hearing.
   (C)   If any default judgment is set aside pursuant to this section, the
Hearing Officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien
which has been recorded for any debt due and owing the Village as a result of
the vacated default judgment.
(Ord. CO-03-11, passed 4-21-2003)
§ 39.12 SUBPOENAS.
   (A)   An administrative Hearing Officer may issue a subpoena only if he
determines that the testimony of the witnesses or the documents or items sought
by the subpoena are necessary to present evidence that is:
      (1)   Relevant to the case; and
      (2)   Relates to a contested issue in the case.
   (B)   A subpoena issued under this chapter shall identify:
      (1)   The person to whom it is directed;

witnesses or the production of the documents or other items be less than 7 days
after service of the subpoena.

§ 39.13 PAYMENT OF FINES.
   All fines and other monies to be paid to the Village in accordance with this
chapter shall be remitted to the Village and deposited in the appropriate
Village account as designated by the Village Manager.
(Ord. CO-03-11, passed 4-21-2003)
§ 39.14 VEHICLE CONFISCATION HEARINGS.
   (A-1) Whenever the owner of record of a vehicle seized and impounded
pursuant to §§
99.18 through
99.25 of this Code requests a preliminary hearing in person and in writing at
the Ordinance Enforcement Department within 15 days after the vehicle is seized
and impounded, a preliminary hearing shall be held before the Administrative
Hearing Officer at the next administrative adjudication hearing date, unless
the vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to §
99.19 and the Police Department determines that it must retain custody of the
vehicle under applicable state or federal forfeiture law. If, after the
preliminary hearing, the Administrative Hearing Officer determines that there
is probable cause to believe that the vehicle was used in a violation of this
Code for which seizure and impoundment applies, the Administrative Hearing
Officer shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in
this section unless the applicable bond is paid pursuant to division (G) of
this section. If the Administrative Hearing Officer determines that there is no
such probable cause, the vehicle will be returned without penalty or other
fees.
   (A)   Within 10 days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to §§
99.18 through
99.25 of this Code, the Police Department or other appropriate Department shall
notify by first class mail or personal service the owner of record of the
seizure and impoundment of the vehicle, the penalty assessed, and of his right
to request a hearing before the Ordinance Enforcement Department to challenge
whether a violation of this Code for which seizure and impoundment applies has
occurred pursuant to this division. A copy of the notice shall be forwarded to
the Ordinance Enforcement Department. The notice shall state the penalties that
may be imposed if a hearing is not requested, including that a vehicle not
released by cash bond and remaining in the Village pound may be sold or
disposed of by the Village in accordance with applicable law.
   (B)   The owner of record seeking a hearing must file a written request for
a hearing with the Ordinance Enforcement Department no later than 30 days after
the vehicle was seized and impounded. The date of the hearing must not be more
than 30 days after a request for a hearing has been filed. Hearings are to be
conducted in accordance with §§
39.01 through
39.13, and to the extent that there is a conflict between §§
39.01 through
39.13 and this section, the latter shall prevail.
   (C)   If, after the hearing, the Administrative Hearing Officer determines
by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in the violation
of any applicable provision of the Village Code, the Administrative Hearing
Officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record liable to the Village
for the amount of the administrative penalty prescribed for the violation, plus
towing and storage fees. If, after a hearing, the administrative hearing
officer determines by the preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was
not used in the violation of this Village Code, the Administrative Hearing
Officer shall enter an order finding for the owner and for the return of the
vehicle or cash bond, unless the vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to §
99.19 and the Police Department determines that it must retain custody of the
vehicle under applicable state and federal forfeiture law, in which case the
vehicle shall not be returned unless and until the Village receives notices
from the appropriate state, or where applicable, federal officials that
forfeiture proceedings will not be instituted, or forfeiture proceedings have
concluded and there is a settlement or a court order providing that the vehicle
shall be returned to the owner of record.
   (D)   If a request for a hearing is not made within 30 days of the seizure
and impoundment of the vehicle, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and shall
be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned
vehicles. The vehicle shall not be released to the owner or record until the
administrative penalty prescribed for the violation is paid to the Village, and
only after the applicable towing and storage fees have been paid to the towing
agent.
   (E)   If the owner of record requests a hearing, but fails to appear at the
hearing or fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record
shall be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing and an Administrative
Hearing Officer of the Ordinance Enforcement Department shall enter a default
order in favor of the Village in the amount of the administrative penalty
prescribed for the violation, plus towing and storage fees.
   (F)   The owner of record of the motor vehicle may waive his right to a
hearing under this section by agreeing and stipulating in writing that the
seized motor vehicle was being used in violation of this section. Once the
waiver is signed and the penalty and any applicable towing and storage fees are
paid, the seized vehicle will be released.
   (G)   If a bond in the amount of the administrative penalty prescribed for
the violation is posted with the Police Department, the impounded vehicle shall
be released to the owner of record. If the prescribed administrative penalty is
subsequently imposed under this section, the bond shall be forfeited to the
Village; however, in the event a violation is not proven by a preponderance of
the evidence, the bond will be returned to the person posting the bond. All
bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the Police
Department until the Hearing Officer issues a decision, or, if there is a
judicial review, until the circuit court issues its decision.
   (H)   An administrative penalty, plus towing and storage fees, imposed
pursuant to this section shall constitute a debt due to the Village, which may
be enforced pursuant to §
39.16 or in any other manner provided by law. Any cash bond posted pursuant to
this section shall be applied to the penalty. Except as provided otherwise in
this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the administrative
penalty, plus any applicable towing and storage fees, is paid to the Village,
in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is
legally entitled to possess the vehicle, or the vehicle is sold or otherwise
disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law.
   (I)   Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 30 days after the
expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial
review of the Village's action under this section, or, if judicial review is
sought, the time at which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the Village,
or the time a final administrative decision is rendered against an owner of
record who is in default, may be disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle as
provided by law; provided that, if the vehicle was seized and impounded
pursuant to §
99.19 and the proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug
asset forfeiture laws, the vehicle may not be disposed of by the Village except
as consistent with those proceedings.
   (J)   Fees for towing and storage of vehicles under this section shall be
the same as those charged for other Police Department tows.
   (K)   All penalties collected and retained by the Village under this section
shall be deposited with the Village Treasurer.

accordance with applicable law.
   (B)   After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of a
Code violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the

manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   In any case in which a respondent fails to comply with a Hearing
Officer's order to correct a Code violation or imposing a fine or other
sanction as a result of a Code violation, any expenses incurred by the Village
to enforce the Hearing Officer's order, including, but not limited to,
attorney's fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or
foreclosure after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a
Hearing Officer, shall be a debt due and owing the Village and may be collected
in accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expense being fixed by a
Hearing Officer, the respondent shall be provided with notice that states that
the respondent shall appear at a hearing before a Hearing Officer to determine
whether the respondent has failed to comply with the Hearing Officer's order.
The notice shall set the time for the hearing, which shall not be less than 7
days from the date that notice is served. Notice shall be served by first class
mail and the 7-day period shall begin to run on the date that the notice was
deposited in the mail.
   (D)   A lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or
both, of the defendant in the amount of any debt due and owing the municipality
under this section. The lien may be recorded and enforced in the same manner as
a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. No
lien may be enforced under this section until it has been recorded in the
manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, Article XII (735 ILCS 5/12-101
et seq.) or by the Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.)
   (E)   Nothing is this section shall prevent the Village from enforcing or
seeking to enforce any order of a Hearing Officer in any manner which is in
accordance with applicable law.

disprove liability shall be based on the following grounds:
         (a)   That all fines and penalties for the violations cited in the
notice have been paid in full; or

notice of impending vehicle immobilization was issued.
      (2)   If a registered owner has tickets listed in the seizure section of
a notice, he or she must pay all fines and penalties within 21 days of the
first seizure notice of such fines and penalties or any vehicle registered in
his or her name may be booted. Payment for all required tickets is necessary or
a registered owner’s vehicle(s) will remain boot eligible.
   (C)   Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed
to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Such notice shall warn that the vehicle
is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its
damage. The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage
to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of Illinois Criminal Code, §§ 16-
1 and 21-1 (720 ILCS 5/16-1 and 21-1). The notice shall also provide
information specifying how release of the immobilizing restraint may be had,

restraint has not been released within 24 hours of its placement, the restraint
shall be released and the vehicle towed and impounded.
   (D)   The owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized person may
secure the release of the vehicle by paying the immobilization, towing and
storage fees provided in division (G) of this section and all fines and
penalties remaining due on each final determination of liability issued to such
person.
   (E)   The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a hearing
to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing was erroneous,
if the owner files a written request for a hearing with the Village Traffic
Compliance Administrator within 15 days after immobilization or 15 days of the
date of the notice sent pursuant to division (F) of this section, whichever is
later. Hearings requested pursuant to this section shall be conducted on any
business day within 15 business days upon receipt of a written request for a
hearing. The determination regarding the validity of the immobilization shall
become final for the purpose of judicial review under the Administrative Review
Law of Illinois upon issuance. Failure to request or attend a scheduled hearing
shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing. A hearing provided by this
section shall not determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any
citation or notice of ordinance violation issued relative to the immobilized
vehicle, but shall only relate to whether the vehicle was properly immobilized
or towed.
   (F)   Within 10 days after an immobilized vehicle has been impounded, a
notice of impoundment shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the address of the registered owner as listed with the Secretary
of State. The notice shall state that the owner has the right to request a
post-immobilization and post-towing hearing as provided in division (E) of this
section, and that if the vehicle is not claimed within 30 days from the date of
the notice, the vehicle may be sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with
Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/4-208.
   (G)   The fine for immobilization shall be $60, and the fine for towing,
subsequent to immobilization, shall be an amount not to exceed $500. The owner
of the vehicle shall also be charged reasonable storage fees should the vehicle
be removed to a private storage facility, provided that no fees shall be
assessed for any immobilization or tow which has been determined to be
erroneous.
   (H)   The Village Traffic Compliance Administrator shall appoint or retain
the services of an individual agency or company to tow and impound vehicles in
accordance herewith, provided that the individual, agency or company is fully
insured and licensed according to local and state law and has available a
secured impound area within which to retain vehicles impounded hereunder. For
purposes of this section, a secured area shall mean an area bounded by a fence,
chainlink or otherwise, of sufficient height and with locking gates so as to
minimize or prevent unauthorized entry into the impounded vehicles.
   (I)   It shall be unlawful to remove or damage the immobilizing dev ice or
to relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilization device without
the prior approval of the Village Traffic Compliance Administrator. Any person
who violates this section shall be subject to a penalty of $500 for such
violation.

benefits based on the evidence presented at the hearing which shall include
findings of fact, decision and order.
   (B)   Hearings. Hearings for the determination of eligibility for benefits
under PSEBA shall be initiated by the Village after the submission of a full
and complete PSEBA application, and a determination by the hearing officer that
it is appropriate to proceed with the hearing, which determination shall
include consideration of the status of any disability pension proceeding
related to the applicant and whether the disability pension proceeding has
resulted in a final and non-appealable decision. A hearing shall be held to

      (1)   Record. Hearings shall be attended by a certified court reporter,
and a transcript of all proceedings shall be made by said certified court
reporter.
      (2)   Procedures. The Village and the applicant shall be entitled to
representation by counsel at hearings and may present witnesses, testimony and
documents, may cross-examine opposing witnesses, and may request the issuance
by the hearing officer of subpoenas to compel the appearance of relevant
witnesses or the production of relevant documents. The hearing officer may
issue subpoenas to compel the appearance of relevant witnesses or the
production of relevant documents in his/her discretion.
      (3)   Evidence. The Illinois Rules of Evidence shall apply to the extent
practicable unless, by such application, the hearing officer determines that
application of the rule would be an injustice or preclude the introduction of
evidence of the type commonly relied upon by a reasonably prudent person in the
conduct of her/his affairs. Such determination shall be in the sole discretion
of the hearing officer. The hearing officer must state on the record his or her
reason for that determination.
      (4)   Final determination. A written determination by the hearing officer
of whether the applicant is eligible for benefits under the PSEBA shall
constitute a final administrative determination for the purpose of judicial
review under the common law writ of certiorari. Motions to reconsider, set
aside or challenge the final determination of the hearing officer are not
permitted.
      (5)   Burden of proof. At any administrative hearing, the applicant shall
have the obligation and burden of proof to establish that the applicant is
eligible and qualified to receive PSEBA benefits. The standard of proof in all
hearings shall be by the preponderance of the evidence.

Public Works and the Chief of the Fire Department shall inspect, in operation,
the type of incinerator to be installed. The type of incinerator shall be
approved if it does not create a nuisance and conforms to all Village
ordinances. Every installed commercial type incinerator shall be inspected by
the Chief of the Fire Department and Director of Public Works at least twice
each year for which the incinerator is licensed. Such licenses shall be revoked
whenever the incinerator does not conform to Village ordinances or is operated
in violation thereof.
   (E)   Every commercial type incinerator shall stand at least 4 feet from any
building and shall be enclosed by a wire chain-link fence at least 5 feet in
height, with openings not more than 3 inches wide. Such fence shall be at least

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.01 APPLICATION FOR WATER OR SEWER SERVICE.
   (A)   Any householder, property owner or other person desiring water or
sewer service from the Village shall make an application therefor to the Water
Department and/or Director of Public Works on a form to be furnished by such
Department. Every such applicant shall state specifically and in detail the
name of the applicant, the permit desired, the place, location and kind of
connection and appendages sought, the purpose for which the water is to be
used, and all the plumbing and plumbing work in any manner or water connected
therewith, the character and location of any and all proposed drains, the
number and location of all water closets, sinks, bathtubs and other sanitary
fixtures. The application may require such additional information as may be
needed for the proper guidance of the Village officials in the issuing of the
permit. The application shall contain an agreement on the part of the applicant
that all provisions of ordinances relating to the waterworks and sewerage
system and street openings will be complied with; that all water rates,
assessments and rents, and all fines and penalties assessed, charged, or
imposed against the applicant or the property described in the application will
be paid. Where such application includes the installation of sewer and/or water
lines, the applicant shall acknowledge that the property must be in full
compliance with the land and water pollution requirements of the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Water Pollution Control and
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, other applicable state, federal,
county or other laws or regulatory requirements relating to sewer and/or water
lines and service, and any applicable ordinance set forth in this Code. The
applicant will provide the name and other identifying information as to the
owner of the property where water service is to be provided and will give
credit information on the applicant.
   (B)   When the applicant has complied with the provisions of the ordinances
of the Village, and any other applicable land and water pollution requirements
of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Water Pollution
Control and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, other applicable state,
federal, county or other laws or regulatory requirements relating to sewer and/
or water lines and service, and any applicable ordinance set forth in this
Code, and has paid all fees, a permit shall then be issued by the Director of
Public Works authorizing the connection to be made and specifying the size
thereof. The permit shall also authorize all plumbing and plumbing work and all
excavating in accordance with the provisions of this Code or other applicable
ordinances. The construction work in connection with the water service and the
sewer service shall be performed by a licensed and certified plumber and, where
applicable, by a drain layer who have properly executed bonds on file in the
office of the Village Clerk. Where any building or structure has been found to
be abandoned for 90 days or more, or is being improved, upgraded, demolished,
or rehabbed at 50% or more of the building’s assessed value, or where the
habitable space is being increased (additional bedrooms, sleeping rooms, or
bathrooms), and/or there are changes to interior supply lines (except those in
the course of ordinary repairs) or where plumbing is being substantially
upgraded, the applicant shall be required to ensure all water service piping,
which includes all piping from the water meter location to the terminating
fixture, shall be piped from the street main to the water distribution system
for the building. If flushometers or other devices requiring a high rate of
water flow are used, the water service pipe shall be designed and installed to
provide the additional flow.

facilities of the combined waterworks and sewerage system. The Board of
Trustees reserve the right to enter into separate contracts with any user of
the facilities of the combined system for special rates and charges where the
particular circumstances render the regular rates for service inadequate or
unjust.

§ 51.03 BILLS FOR SERVICE, LIABILITY OF CUSTOMER.
   (A)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Water Administrator to cause a
statement of charges for sewer and water service to be delivered at least once
every month to each customer. The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof,
and the user of the service shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for
the service on such premises. The service is furnished the premises by the
Village only upon the condition that the owner of premises, the occupant and
the user of the service are jointly and severally liable therefor.
      (2)   All bills for service shall be rendered as of the first day of the
month succeeding the period for which the service is billed, and except where a
timely request for hearing has been filed as set forth in division (H), shall
be payable not later than the close of business on the fifteenth day after the
date of the bill. If payment of the full amount of the bill is not made within
said 15 day period, then a penalty of 10% shall be added thereto. In cases
where a request for hearing has been filed as set forth in division (H), a bill
shall become payable immediately upon the rendering of a final decision
pursuant to division (H), and a penalty of 10% shall be added thereto if not
paid within 1 day of such final decision.
   (B)   In the event the charges for service are not paid within 30 days from
the date of the bill for such service, and no timely request for hearing has
been filed as set forth in division (H), the charges shall be deemed to be
delinquent, and the Village may pursue any of the remedies set forth in
divisions (C), (D), (E) and (F) of this section. The amount of any delinquent
charges shall be a lien upon the real estate on which the premises to which
service was provided are located. In cases where a request for hearing has been
filed as set forth in division (H), a bill shall be deemed delinquent if not
paid within 1 day of the rendering of a final decision pursuant to division
(H).
   (C)   In the event that charges for service to premises are deemed to be
delinquent under division (B) of this section, the Village shall have the right
to shut off in whole or in part the water supply to such premises. Prior to
disconnection of water service for non-payment of water charges, the Water
Administrator shall cause a notice to be sent to the occupants of the premises
and to the person to whom the water bill for the premises is sent. Courtesy
copies of the notice will also be sent to the owner of record, mortgage
company, taxpayer of record and/or management company of the premises where the
account is located, if different than the occupants of the premises and/or
person to whom the water bill for the premises is sent, based on information
ascertained from County records and the Village's account and landlord
registration records. Failure to send courtesy copies of the notice or non-
receipt of said notice shall not be a defense to the obligation of any
responsible party to pay the outstanding charges. The notice shall specify the
outstanding overdue balance of charges, and provide options to pay the
outstanding balance, to pay a percentage of the outstanding overdue balance of
charges and enter into a payment plan with the Village, or to request a hearing
to be held by a hearing officer or the Water Administrator or an appointee
appointed by the Village Manager, at which hearing said requesting party may
show cause as to why the water service to the premises should not be
disconnected for non-payment of the delinquent charges. The notice shall be
entitled "Notice of Options and Right to Request a Hearing as to Whether Water
Service Should be Shut Off for Non-Payment of Bills" and shall be mailed or
delivered personally to the various parties. In addition, where the premises
are a multi-family dwelling, the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place
upon or near the premises.
   Any recipient of such a notice or resident of a multi-family dwelling where
such a notice is posted may request a payment plan or a hearing at which they
may show cause as to why the water service to the premises should not be
disconnected for nonpayment of the delinquent charges. If such notice as is
required by this subsection is served by personal delivery, then a request for
a payment plan or a hearing must be made to the office of the Water Department
on a form to be provided by the Water Department within 72 hours of the date
such notice was delivered. If such notice as is required by this subsection is
served by mail, then a request for a payment plan or a hearing must be made to
the Water Department within 5 days of mailing of such notice. Water service
shall not be disconnected to any premises if a payment plan is entered into and
its terms followed, or until after any hearing requested under this subsection
is held as provided for in this subsection. If no request for a payment plan or
a hearing is submitted within the time periods established herein, the Village
shall have the right to shut off in whole or in part the water supply to the
premises listed in said notices.
   (D)   If charges for water service have been deemed to be delinquent under
division (B) of this section, then the Water Administrator shall be entitled to
file a notice with the Recorder of Deeds or the Registrar of Titles of Cook
County, stating that the Village has a lien on the premises in the amount of
the delinquent charges. Such notice shall be entitled “Notice of Lien” and
shall contain a legal description of the real estate on which the premises is
located, the amount of the unpaid charges and a statement that the Village
claims a lien against the real estate for the amount of the unpaid charges as
well as for all charges for water service incurred subsequent to the filing of
the Notice of Lien. A copy of the notice of the lien shall be sent to the
person to whom the water bill for the premises has been sent. The Corporation
Counsel, Prosecuting Attorney or whatever attorney designated by the Village
Manager shall file suit to foreclose any lien for which a Notice of Lien has
been filed pursuant to this subsection upon the direction of the Water
Administrator.
   (E)   In the event that charges have been deemed to be delinquent under
division (B) of this section, then the attorney designated by the Village
Manager, at the direction of the Water Administrator or Village Manager, shall
file an action in the Circuit Court against the premises to which service was
supplied, the occupant of the premises and/or the user of the service to
recover the amount of charges due.
   (F)   In the event that charges have been deemed to be delinquent under
division (B) of this section and the shutting off of water service to the
delinquent account will interfere with another customer’s service the Water
Administrator shall order the joint line service to be separated and the
charges for such severance shall be assessed to the delinquent account customer
and/or owner and charged as part of the costs of collection.
   (G)   The remedies set forth in divisions (C), (D), (E) and (F) of this
section may be applied severally or cumulatively. In addition to the charges
and penalty due, should the Village pursue any of the remedies set forth in
divisions (C), (D), (E) and (F) of this section, the Village shall be entitled
to collect the costs of filing any Notice of Lien, foreclosing on the lien,
separating any service lines and any other costs, including but not limited to
attorneys fees, the Village may incur in collecting delinquent charges. The
Village shall not be obligated to resume service if service has been shut off,
or release any lien, if notice of a lien has been filed, until:
      (1)   All charges in arrears on the premises have been paid and all
expenses incurred by the Village with respect to the collection of delinquent
charges at the premises have been paid; and
      (2)   A fee of $150 has been paid to reimburse the Village for the
services of the Village’s Department of Public Works and Water Department in
reinstating water service to the premises.
   (H)   (1)   Any person liable for a bill for service hereunder who disputes
the accuracy of a particular bill may do so by requesting in writing a hearing
before the Finance Director of the Village within 10 days of the date of the
bill. A request for hearing shall be made to the Finance Department on a form
provided by the Finance Department. On the designated hearing date set by the
Finance Director, the petitioning party may present evidence in support of
their claim that the bill is inaccurate. The Finance Director will provide
written notice to the petitioning party of the hearing date. The Finance
Director shall, within 3 days following the hearing, make a written
determination as to the accuracy of the bill and is authorized to make
adjustments to the bill of up to 20% of the total bill amount. The person
disputing the bill may then either accept the decision of the Finance Director,
and make payment in full of the bill or adjusted bill amount, or may appeal the
decision of the Finance Director to the Finance Committee of the Village Board

method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
Certified Operator in Responsible Charge and the Ill. Environmental Protection
Agency.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Certified Operator in Responsible Charge
to cause surveys and investigations to be made of industrial and other
properties served by the public water supply to determine whether actual or
potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys and
investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be repeated at
least every 2 years, or as often as the Certified Operator in Responsible
Charge shall deem necessary. Records of such surveys shall be maintained and
available for review for a period of at least 5 years.
   (D)   The approved cross-connection control device inspector shall have the
right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to
the public water supply or distribution system of the Village for the purpose
of verifying the presence or absence of cross-connection, and that the
Certified Operator in Responsible Charge or his authorized agent shall have the
right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to
the public water supply or distribution system of the Village for the purpose
of verifying information submitted by the customer regarding the required
cross-connection control inspection. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants
of any property so served shall furnish the Certified Operator in Responsible
Charge any information which he may request regarding the piping system or
systems of water use on such property. The refusal of such information, when
demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Certified Operator in Responsible
Charge shall be deemed to be evidence of the presence of improper connections
as provided in this section.

reconnection fee of $1,000 is paid to the Village. Immediate disconnection with
verbal notice can be effected when the Certified Operator in Responsible Charge
is assured that imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water
supply system exists. Such action shall be followed by written notification of
the cause of disconnection. Immediate disconnection without notice to any party
can be effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of
the public water supply, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the
Certified Operator in Responsible Charge or the Ill. Environmental Protection
Agency, such action is required to prevent actual or potential contamination of
the public water supply. Neither the public water supply, Certified Operator in
Responsible Charge, or its agents or assigns shall be liable to any customer
for injury, damages or lost revenues which may result from termination of the
customer's water supply in accordance with the terms of this section whether or
not the termination was with or without notice.

pollution by isolating within the customer’s water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system;
         (b)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water systems and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable safety;
         (c)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public, and consumers potable water systems.
      (2)   Application. These rules and regulations shall apply to all
premises served by the public potable water supply system of the Village.
      (3)   Policy. The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or back-siphonage of contaminants through the customer's water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the Certified Operator in Responsible Charge
or his authorized representative, an approved backflow prevention device is
necessary for the safety of the public water supply system, the Certified
Operator in Responsible Charge shall give notice to the consumer to install
such approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to the

§ 70.01 STATE TRAFFIC LAWS ADOPTED.
   (A)   The Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/1-100 et seq., is hereby adopted
and made a part of this chapter by reference and shall be applicable in the
Village.
   (B)   Any person who violates any provision of the Illinois Vehicle Code
within the Village shall be subject to the penalty provided for violation of
this Code.
(1997 Code, 41.01) Penalty, see 10.99
§ 70.02 IMMOBILIZATION OF VEHICLES.
   (A)   Immobilization. A motor vehicle may be immobilized in such a manner as
to prevent its operation after notice and an opportunity for hearing under the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Where the owner of the motor vehicle owes fines for 3 or more
tickets for parking violations. An owner of a motor vehicle will be deemed to
owe fines for purposes of this provision in the following instances:
         (a)   Where the court date set for hearing on the parking violation
has passed and the owner has failed to appear;
         (b)   Where at a court hearing a finding of guilty has been entered
for said parking violation;
         (c)   Provided, however, that as to both (a) and (b) a fine shall not
be deemed owed if the owner has posted bond in the amount of the fine, has paid
the fine, or has entered into an agreement with the proper authorities of the
Village for payment of the fine; or
      (2)   Where the owner of the motor vehicle has failed to obtain a Village
vehicle license for the motor vehicle as required by §§ 70.20 et seq.
   (B)   Notice to owner.
      (1)   Whenever the Police Department has placed a motor vehicle on its
immobilization list, a notice of such listing shall be mailed to the last
registered owner of such vehicle at the address listed in the most current
registration list of Illinois motor vehicles. In the event that no information
is available through the registration list or current Village vehicle license
records, no notice shall be required.
      (2)   The notice shall specify that the motor vehicle has been placed on
the immobilization list, that the owner is entitled to a hearing as set forth
in division (C) of this section, and that the motor vehicle will be immobilized
on or after the eighth day following the date of the notice. The notice shall
set forth the payment required from the owners to satisfy outstanding parking
violations.
   (C)   Hearing.
      (1)   The owner of a motor vehicle that has been placed on an
immobilization list may request a hearing. The request for a hearing must be
made in writing and delivered to the office of the Village Manager not more
than 7 days after the date of the notice that the owner’s motor vehicle has
been placed on the immobilization list.
      (2)   The hearing shall be conducted by the Village Manager or such other
official or employee of the Village as the Village Manager may designate. In no
case shall the hearing officer be a civilian or sworn personnel of the Village
Police Department or any other individual who was involved in the initial
decision to immobilize the vehicle. At the hearing, the owner may present
evidence that the vehicle was improperly designated. If, following the hearing,
the Village Manager, or appointed designee, determines that the vehicle was
improperly designated, the vehicle shall be removed from the immobilization
list and any fees paid to the Village as a result of the vehicle having been
placed on the immobilization list shall be refunded.
   (D)   Release of motor vehicle.
      (1)   If the Village Manager, or appointed designee, determines that the
motor vehicle has been properly placed on the immobilization list, or if no
hearing is requested, the owner may obtain the removal of the motor vehicle
upon the immobilization list by:
         (a)   Making the payment of any fines owed and paying any Village
license fees owed;
         (b)   Posting a bond in the amount of any fines owed and any Village
license fees owed and requesting a court hearing.
      (2)   If the Village has immobilized the motor vehicle, the owner must,
in addition to making payment or posting the bond described above, pay a
booting fee of $50 for such immobilization.
   (E)   Immobilization notice. In any case involving immobilization of a motor
vehicle pursuant to this section, the Police Department shall cause to be
placed on such vehicle, in a conspicuous manner, notice sufficient to warn any
individual to the effect that such vehicle has been immobilized and that any
attempt to move such vehicle might result in damage to such vehicle.

71.17, vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop
at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on

shown.
      (2)   Except as provided in §
71.17, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the
intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering
the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication permitting the

   (A)   Subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees, the Village Manager
may designate either side, or both sides, or any portion of, either side, of
any street as a restricted parking area, and shall determine the time of the
day and any such parking restriction shall be effective as well as the duration
of time allowed for continuous vehicular parking, and shall cause appropriate
signs to be erected and maintained in such areas designating the effective time
of day of such parking restriction as well as the duration of time that
continuous vehicular parking is allowed. Such designation shall be evidenced by
the physical presence of such signs or legends or notices on or near the
parking lane of the streets or portions thereof where such restriction is to be
effective.
   (B)   No person shall park a vehicle for any period of time in excess of the

park a vehicle on the public streets or on Village property, between the hours
of 2:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. of any day, except physicians on calls.
   (B)   Temporary permits. Temporary permits to park a vehicle on the street
overnight may be informally approved for periods during which construction is

requests terminate upon completion of the construction or earlier where the
construction no longer prevents parking on the property.
   (C)   Call-in parking exceptions. A call-in exception to the overnight
parking prohibition may be obtained by calling the Police Department between
the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. immediately prior to the overnight period
for which parking is requested and providing the Department with the resident
name, address, vehicle make, model and license plate number and parking
location. Such requests are limited to 5 times each calendar month for each
dwelling unit in the Village. Such requests may be denied in the discretion of
the Village Manager, or his or her designee, where there is reason to believe
the request would jeopardize the health, welfare and safety of the Village’s
residents.

§ 72.34 OVERNIGHT PARKING PERMITS.
   (A)   Overnight parking permit program established. There is hereby
established in the Village an overnight parking permit program. An overnight
parking permit issued pursuant to this section shall entitle the permittee to
park 1 vehicle in a designated place for a period not to exceed 12 months. The
program shall be administered by the Finance Director, or his or her designee.
   (B)   Overnight parking permit applications. To obtain an overnight parking
permit, an application must be submitted to the Finance Director, on a form
created by the Finance Director, along with a permit fee of $100 for 6 months
or $200 for 1 year of overnight parking. Each such application shall set forth
the name and address of the applicant; the license number of the vehicle, the
make, year and type of vehicle; the reason an overnight parking permit is
necessary for the period requested and such other pertinent information as the
Finance Director may require. Only residents of the Village shall be eligible
to receive annual or biannual overnight parking permits.
   (C)   Investigation. Upon receipt of an overnight parking permit
application, the Finance Director shall cause to be made such investigation as
he may deem proper to ascertain whether such permit should be granted. No
overnight parking permit shall be issued for vehicles without current Village
vehicle stickers or to individuals with outstanding Village parking citations.
Proof of residency of the applicant in the form of a lease or proof of property
ownership shall be required. The vehicle for which parking is requested must be
registered to the resident whose name is reflected on the lease or property
ownership documents. The applicant’s driver’s license must reflect the address
for which the parking permit is requested. No permit shall be issued for
single-family homes where the applicant has a driveway or otherwise has access
to the backyard through an alley or has a garage on the property. No more than
2 overnight parking permits may be issued per dwelling unit. If, upon
submission of the application and all materials required, the Finance Director,
after investigation, determines there is no adequate off- street parking space
reasonably obtainable by the applicant at the place of his residence, or within
300 feet thereof, for the overnight parking of the vehicle described in the
application, an overnight parking permit shall be granted; otherwise, it shall
be denied.
   (D)   Permits: contents; term. Each permit shall contain a brief description
of the vehicle, the area within which the vehicle may be parked and the
expiration date thereof. An overnight parking permit shall authorize the
vehicle to which it applies to park overnight on a street in the area
designated in the permit and in a location within said area where the vehicle
may otherwise be legally parked. Such permit does not authorize the parking of
a vehicle in no parking zones, handicapped spaces, tow and loading zones,
adjacent to fire hydrants, blocking a driveway or in any other place where
parking is restricted for any purpose other than overnight parking. The permit
shall be effective only for the vehicle stated on the permit and only when said
vehicle is parked in the area stated on the permit. Permits shall be for a
period of time between 3 months and 1 year as requested by the applicant and
deemed necessary by the Finance Director.
   (E)   Transfer of ownership of vehicle; change of residence; termination of
necessity. Upon the transfer of the vehicle described in any permit or upon the
permittee’s change of place of residence or obtaining off-street parking
facilities for such vehicle rendering the permit unnecessary, the permittee
shall destroy the permit and report such destruction to the Finance Director.
   (F)   Renewal. Upon application for renewal at the expiration of any
overnight parking permit or within 7 days prior thereto, the Finance Director
shall cause to be made such investigation as he may deem proper to ascertain
whether a renewal of the permit should be granted. The Finance Director may
grant a renewal of the permit if, as a result of the investigation, he
determines that the need for the permit still exists and the permittee is
otherwise eligible pursuant to this section.
   (G)   Lost permit. If a permittee loses, surrenders or destroys a permit for
a permitted vehicle, he may obtain another permit for the same vehicle for the
remaining permit term or a permit for a substituted vehicle for the term upon
the payment of a permit replacement fee in the amount of $100 for 6 months or
$200 for 1 year.
   (H)   Display of permits. A sticker supplied by the Village evidencing the
issuance of an overnight parking permit shall be at all times displayed in the
5-inch square of the lower left-hand corner of the rear window of the vehicle.
All previously issued stickers shall be removed prior to display of newly
issued sticker. The sticker shall be plainly visible from the exterior.
   (I)   Vehicles for which permits shall not be issued; exemptions. No
overnight parking permit shall be issued for any vehicle other than a passenger
automobile, van or pickup truck whose primary purpose is to transport
passengers for non-commercial purposes. No permit shall be issued for any
automobile, truck, trailer, van or pickup truck whose primary purpose is
commercial in nature, passenger trailer, motor home, house car, camper, boat,
boat trailer, commercially licensed vehicle or vehicle other than a car, van or
pickup truck whose primary purpose is to transport passengers for non-
commercial purposes. In the case of a van or pickup truck, the applicant shall
sign a declaration, under penalty of perjury, stating that the primary use of
the vehicle is non-commercial transportation of passengers. Permits issued
under this section are subject to revocation if it is discovered that the
vehicle to which the permit is issued is not in compliance with the declaration
on file. Upon a written application to the Finance Director, or his or her
designee, and a showing of good cause that the application of this division
works an unreasonable hardship upon the owner or occupant of real property
within the Village, the Finance Director, or his or her designee, with or
without holding a hearing thereon, may grant an exemption from the provisions
of this section upon such terms and conditions as the Finance Director, or his
or her designee, shall determine in his or her sole discretion.
   (J)   Designated areas and prohibited areas. The Finance Director, or his or
her desginee, may approve an application for an overnight parking permit as
provided in this section for use on any street in the Village, except that no
overnight parking permit shall be issued for use on the following streets:
      (1)   1st Avenue (entire Village).
      (2)   5th Avenue (entire Village, except from Roosevelt Road to Filmore
Avenue).

§ 72.35 DROP-OFF ZONES FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to park a vehicle in any public
parking area posted as a “Drop-Off Zone for Persons With Disabilities”, unless
that person is parked in such parking area for purposes of picking up or
dropping off one or more persons with disabilities from the property that
applied for and received authorization to post the Drop-Off Zone for Persons
With Disabilities signage.
   (B)   Upon request of a person with disabilities who has been issued a
Certificate of Registration pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/3-616 or any Village
institution that provides services to persons with disabilities and approval of
the corporate authorities of the Village by ordinance, a parking space in the
street adjacent to the residence of the persons with disabilities or the
Village institution shall be designated by the posting of official signage of
the Department of Public Works as reserved for Drop-Off Zone for Persons With
Disabilities. No person shall park a motor vehicle in the space so designated
unless it bears special registration plates issued pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/3-
616. If a permanently disabled resident or a Village institution desires a
drop-off zone for disabled persons, the application for such a zone shall
follow the below procedures of this section and criteria listed. Drop-off zones
for persons with disabilities shall meet the following criteria:
      (1)   The person or entity seeking the drop-off zone for persons with
disabilities must demonstrate the need for such a zone. Factors to be
considered in determining the need for such a drop-off zone shall include the
following: the number of persons with disabilities traveling to and from the
proposed drop-off zone location, the frequency of this activity, the
difficulties encountered without the proposed drop-off zone and the alternate
solutions available.
      (2)   The proposed drop-off zone for persons with disabilities shall not
have a substantial negative impact on existing parking and traffic conditions
in the area.
      (3)   The need which must be demonstrated under this section must not be
the need for parking for persons with disabilities, but rather the need for a
location to stop a vehicle which carries a person or persons with disabilities
only long enough to drop off or pick up such person or persons from a
designated place. The regular use of special motor vehicles or buses for the
transport of persons with disabilities to and from a designated place shall be
considered as evidence indicating the need for a drop-off zone for persons with
disabilities, rather than the need for parking for persons with disabilities.
      (4)   The size of a Village-approved drop-off zone will be determined
based on the size of the transport vehicle typically used (e.g., automobile,
van, bus).
   (C)   Any person who violates this section shall be fined as set forth in §
39.99 of this Code.
(Ord. CO-2022-18, passed 9-20-2022)
§ 72.36 PARKING OF ABANDONED OR INOPERABLE VEHICLES.
   It shall be unlawful to park any inoperable or abandoned vehicle, as such
vehicles are defined in §
99.01 of this Code, on any street, highway, alley, or other public right-of-way
within the Village. The person in whose name an abandoned vehicle or inoperable
vehicle is or was last registered is the person presumed to have abandoned or
otherwise parked the vehicle. The presumption established under this section
may be rebutted by showing that at the time any citation issued, a report of
vehicle theft has been filed by the owner with respect to the vehicle.
(Ord. CO-08-13, passed 3-4-2008)
§ 72.37 PARKING IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATION SPACE.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to park, stop or stand any vehicle other than an
electric vehicle, as such vehicles are designated and defined in § 13.15 of the
zoning code, in a designated electric vehicle charging station space. Any
vehicle other than an electric vehicle parked, stopped or standing in a
charging station space is subject to fine and/or impoundment of the offending
vehicle.
   (B)   No person shall park, stop or stand an electric vehicle, as such
vehicles are designated and defined in § 13.15 of the zoning code, in a
designated electric vehicle charging station space while not plugged in to the
charging station(s). Any electric vehicle parked, stopped or standing in a
charging station space and not plugged in to the charging station is subject to
fine and/or impoundment of the offending vehicle.
   (C)   The violation of any provision of this Code not pertaining to
prohibiting or restricting vehicular standing, stopping or parking shall be
punishable as an ordinance violation. Punishment shall be by a fine not to
exceed the fine prescribed in accordance with § 39.99 of this Code.

§ 77.01 PURPOSE – ESTABLISHMENT OF AUTOMATED RED LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAM.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the establishment of an
automated traffic law enforcement system. As used in this chapter, an AUTOMATED
TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM means a device with 1 or more motor vehicle
sensors working in conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded
images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a red signal
indication in violation of § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or §§
71.16 and
71.17 of this Code.
   (B)   The system shall utilize an automated traffic control signal
monitoring device which records, through photographic means, the vehicle and
the vehicle registration plate of a vehicle operated in violation of § 11-306
of the Illinois Vehicle Code or §§
71.16 or
71.17 of this Code. The photographic record shall also display the time, date
and location of the violation.
   (C)   A program shall be established which creates, implements and utilizes
an automated traffic law enforcement system at various vehicle traffic
intersections identified by the Village, with the advice of the Police
Department.
   (D)   The Village shall adopt rules and regulations as may be necessary for
the proper enforcement and administration of this chapter.
(Ord. 44, passed 10-21-2008)
§ 77.02 RED LIGHT VIOLATION.
   (A)   The registered owner of record of a vehicle is liable for a violation
of this section and a fine of $100 when the vehicle is used in violation of §
11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or §§
71.16 or
71.17 of this Code and that violation is recorded by an automated traffic
control signal monitoring device as determined by a technician who inspects the
recorded image created by the device. A photographic recording of a violation
obtained by an automated traffic control signal monitoring device that has been
inspected by a technician shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this
chapter. It shall be a defense to a violation of this section that:
      (1)   The operator of the vehicle was issued a uniform traffic citation
for a violation of § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or §§
71.16 or
71.17 of this Code; or
      (2)   The violation occurred at any time during which the vehicle or its
state registration plates were reported to a law enforcement agency as having
been stolen and the vehicle or its plates had not been recovered by the owner
at the time of the alleged violation; or
      (3)   The vehicle was leased to another, and, within 60 days after the
notice was mailed to the owner, the owner/lessor submitted to the Traffic
Compliance Administrator the correct name and address of the lessee of the
vehicle identified in the notice at the time of the violation, together with a
copy of the lease agreement and any additional information as may be required
by the Village. Where the lessor complies with the provisions of this section,
the lessee of the vehicle at the time of the violation shall be deemed to be
the owner of the vehicle for purposes of this chapter. The Traffic Compliance
Administrator, within 30 days of being notified by the lessor of the name and
address of the lessee, shall mail the lessee a notice which contains the
information required under §
77.03. For the purposes of this chapter, the term LEASED VEHICLE shall be
defined as a vehicle in which a motor vehicle dealership or manufacturer has,
pursuant to a written document, vested exclusive possession, use, control and
responsibility of the vehicle to the lessee during the periods the vehicle is
operated by or for the lessee.
   (B)   The provisions of this section do not apply to any authorized
emergency vehicle or where the technician inspecting the recorded image
determines that the vehicle was lawfully participating in a funeral procession,
or that the vehicle entered into the intersection in order to yield the right-
of-way to an emergency vehicle.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of
an operator of a vehicle for any violation of § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle
Code (625 ILCS 5/11-306) or §§
71.16 or
71.17 of this Code.
(Ord. 44, passed 10-21-2008)
§ 77.03 AUTOMATED RED LIGHT VIOLATION NOTICE.
   (A)   For each violation of § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or §§
71.16 or
71.17 recorded by an automated traffic control signal monitoring device, the
Village or its designee shall mail an automated red light violation notice via
U.S. mail, within 30 days after receiving information about the registered
owner of the vehicle from the Secretary of State, and in no event later than 90
days after the violation, to the registered owner of record of the vehicle used
in the commission of the violation. The notice shall include the name and
address of the registered owner of the vehicle; the vehicle registration
number, the vehicle make, if available and readily discernable; the offense
charged; the time, date and location of the alleged violation; the applicable
fine and date by which it must be paid; the monetary penalty which shall be
automatically assessed for late payment; information as to the availability of
an administrative hearing in which the notice may be contested on its merits
and the time and manner in which such hearing may be had; that the basis of the
notice is a photographic record obtained by a traffic control signal monitoring
device; a copy of the recorded image or images; a statement that the recorded
images constitute prima facie evidence of a violation; and a warning that
failure to pay the applicable fine or contest liability in a timely manner is
an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving
privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle.
   (B)   The Village shall only be required to notify a lessee if the leasing
company/lessor provides the lessee's name, a copy of the lease, and any
additional information requested by the Village, within 60 days of the notice's
issuance, as set forth in §
39.41 of this Code. If the lessee information is not provided within 60 days,
the leasing company/lessor may be found liable.
(Ord. 44, passed 10-21-2008)
§ 77.04 GROUNDS FOR ADJUDICATION BY MAIL OR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.
   A person charged with violating § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or §§
71.16 or
71.17 recorded by an automated traffic control signal monitoring device may
contest the charge through an adjudication by mail or at an administrative
hearing limited to 1 or more of the following grounds with appropriate evidence
to support:
   (A)   That the operator of the vehicle was issued a uniform traffic citation
for a violation of § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or §§
71.16 or
71.17 of this Code; or
   (B)   That the violation occurred at any time during which the vehicle or
its state registration plates were reported to a law enforcement agency as
having been stolen and the vehicle or its plates had not been recovered by the
owner at the time of the alleged violation; or
   (C)   That the vehicle was leased to another, and, within 60 days after the

§ 92.22 ABATEMENT OF PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   (A)   An abatement action under this chapter is a remedy cumulative to other
remedies at law and equity. Injunctive relief may be sought to prevent or
restrain violations of this chapter. An abatement action in no way preempts,
supersedes or bars civil or criminal prosecution for violation of this chapter
or any other applicable building, property maintenance, fire prevention, health
or public safety regulation. The commencement of a nuisance abatement action is
not a condition precedent to the initiation of civil or criminal prosecution or
any other remedy. Failure to adhere to the procedure prescribed in this section
shall not bar relief or remedy if such failure causes no prejudice and merely
constitutes harmless error.
   (B)   The following shall be the procedure for the abatement of nuisances
within the jurisdiction of the Village:
      (1)   Notice. Notice shall be given to the owner of the nuisance or of
the property on which the nuisance exists. For purposes of this chapter, the
person to whom the last general tax bill on the property was sent shall be
presumed to be the owner. Personal service, or notice by regular mail and
posting of notice on the front entrance to the structure or similar location
shall be deemed sufficient, legal notice to the owner and all other responsible
parties. If there is no structure on the property, a sign may be posted
anywhere on the premises.
      (2)   Contents of notice. The notice shall state the location and nature
of the nuisance. It shall apprise the owner that if the nuisance is not abated
within a specified number of days, the Village shall, at the expense of such
owner, have such nuisance abated. Five days shall be such specified number
indicated in the notice, unless otherwise stated in this Code, or the public
health and safety require a shorter abatement period. The obligations of the
owner are continuing obligations which are effective for 1 year from the date
of the notice, which date shall be the last date the notice was mailed or the
date the notice was posted, whichever comes last.
      (3)   Abatement. If upon the giving of notice, the owner fails to abate
said nuisance within the time and in the manner specified in the notice, the
Village may cause the nuisance to be abated, as it deems appropriate. The cost
of the abatement shall be assessed against the owner of the land upon which the
nuisance is located. The amount of such costs shall be paid by such owner to
the Village.
      (4)   Summary abatement. If the nuisance is of such threat to the
welfare, safety and comfort of the community that it must be abated
immediately, the Village Manager is hereby authorized to take whatever steps
are necessary to effect the abatement of same regardless of the requirements
herein.
(1997 Code, § 12.03) (Am. Ord. CO-2015-15, passed 7-26-2016; Am. Ord. CO-2023-
34, passed 8-8-2023)
§ 92.23 COST OF ABATEMENT.
   In addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter for the erection,
contrivance, creation, continuance or maintenance of a public nuisance, the
cost of abating a public nuisance by the Village shall be collected as a debt
from the owner, occupant or person causing, permitting or maintaining the
nuisance, and if proper notice to abate the nuisance has been given to the
owner, such cost shall constitute a lien against the real estate in accordance
with the provisions of state law, this chapter, and any other applicable
provisions of this Code. The Village may authorize the preparation and filing
of liens against title to real estate and memoranda of judgment against
individuals and corporate entities as well as the preparation and filing of
releases related thereto to preserve its rights to collect fines, penalties and
other costs imposed by the Village for violations of state law, this chapter
and any other applicable provisions of this Code. Village liens and memoranda
of judgment shall be filed with the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds
or such other appropriate state, federal or county agency. The owner, occupant
or person causing, permitting or maintaining the nuisance or violating state
law or any provision of the Code shall be obligated to pay to the Village the
amount of any fines, penalties or any lien amounts or memorandum of judgment
imposed under this chapter or the Code, and all expenses and costs incurred by
the Village with respect to abating a public nuisance, subject to adjustment by
the Village Manager, or his or her designee, or the Village Prosecutor. In
order to obtain a release of a Village lien or memorandum of judgment, the
following additional payments to the Village are required:
   (A)    $50 for the preparation, handling and filing costs of the Village
lien or memoranda of judgment, or the actual costs, if greater; and
   (B)   $50 for the preparation, handling and filing costs of the release of
Village lien or release of memorandum of judgment or the actual costs, if
greater.

§ 92.24 HIGH GRASS AND WEEDS; TREES AND BUSHES.
   (A)   Nuisance. It shall be unlawful and constitute a public nuisance for
any person who owns or controls any real estate to permit nuisance greenery
upon the property, including but not limited to allowing grass or weeds to grow
on such premises or on the parkways contiguous to such premises to a height of
6 inches or more, or to permit trees or bushes on the property to be untrimmed
or otherwise neglected.
   (B)   Notice prior to abatement. The Village shall give to the owner of the
property where such public nuisance is found a written notice of the existence
of such nuisance and requiring the removal of such nuisance through cutting,
trimming or other removal activities within 10 days following such notice. The
notice shall also notify the owner of the property that unless such nuisance is
removed or compliance otherwise achieved within such 10-day period, the Village
will proceed with the removal of such nuisance, and assess the cost thereof
against the property owner. Service of such notice shall be by personal service
or by certified mail to the person to whom was sent the tax bill for the
general taxes for the last preceding year on the property.
   (C)   Post-abatement notice; lien. 
      (1)   Should the Village abate the nuisance through removal, the cost of
such removal shall be a lien upon the property affected, superior to all other
liens and encumbrances, except tax liens; provided that notice prior to
abatement has been given as herein described, and the owner fails to pay the
cost and expense incurred following receipt of a post-abatement notice stating
the substance of this section, identifying the property by common description,
and describing the cutting, trimming or other removal activity. Service of such
post-abatement notice shall be by personal service or by certified mail to the
person to whom was sent the tax bill for the general taxes for the last
preceding year on the property. A notice of lien shall be filed within 1 year
after an unreimbursed removal cost and expense is incurred the Village. Notices
of lien may be filed by the Village, or person performing the removal by
authority of the Village, in his or its own name, and shall be filed in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds of Cook County. The notice of lien shall
consist of a sworn statement setting out:
         (a)   A description of the property sufficient for identification
thereof;
         (b)   The amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred
or payable for the cutting, trimming or removal, including the related
administrative costs and activities;
         (c)   The date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by the
Village.
      (2)   However, the lien shall not be valid as to any purchaser whose
rights in and to such property have arisen subsequent to the removal and prior
to the filing of such notice, and the lien shall not be valid as to any
mortgagee, judgment creditor or other lien or whose rights in and to such
property arise prior to the filing of such notice.
   (D)   Release of lien. Upon payment of the cost and expenses, including
those costs provided for in §
92.23, by the owner of or persons interested in such property after notice of
lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the Village or person in
whose name the lien has been filed and the release may be filed of record as in
the case of filing notice of lien.
   (E)   Minimum penalty. Any person who violates the provisions of division
(A) of this section shall be subject to the penalty provided for violation of
this Code. Any person who receives more than 2 violations within the same
calendar year for the same property shall receive a ticket from the Village for
the minimum citation amount required by law.

   (B)   Notice prior to abatement. The Village shall give to the owner of the
property where such public nuisance is found a written notice of the existence

control activities within 10 days following such notice. The notice shall also
notify the owner of the property that unless such nuisance is removed or
compliance otherwise achieved within such 10-day period, the Village will
proceed with the removal of such nuisance, and assess the cost thereof against
the property owner. Service of such notice shall be by personal service or by
certified mail to the person to whom was sent the tax bill for the genera!
taxes for the last preceding year on the property.
   (C)   Post-abatement notice; lien. 
      (1)   Should the Village abate the nuisance through removal, the cost of
such removal shall be a lien upon the property affected, superior to all other
liens and encumbrances, except tax liens; provided that notice prior to
abatement has been given as herein described, and the owner fails to pay the
cost and expense incurred following receipt of a post-abatement notice stating
the substance of this section, identifying the property by common description,
and describing the removal activity. Service of such post-abatement notice
shall be by personal service or by certified mail to the person to whom was
sent the tax bill for the general taxes for the last preceding year on the
property. A notice of lien shall be filed within 1 year after an unreimbursed
removal cost and expense is incurred the Village. Notices of lien may be filed
by the Village, or person performing the removal by authority of the Village,
in his or its own name, and shall be filed in the office of the Recorder of

Manager and the office of the Building and Code Enforcement Department. At the
time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing date and time
by mail or in person as the circumstances require.
   (D)   Appointment of hearing officer. The Village Manager shall choose an
officer or employee of the municipality to serve as Hearing Officer. In no case
shall that Hearing Officer be an individual who was involved in the initial
decision to tow the vehicle. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to
require the presence of the Code Enforcement Officer or police officer who
initiated the proposed tow or any other Village personnel.
   (E)   Nature of hearing. The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the
rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing will not be determinative of, or
adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle. After receiving all relevant
evidence, the Hearing Officer shall make a written decision based upon a
preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is authorized
by the laws of the state or the ordinances of the Village, with a specific
statutory or ordinance section cited in the decision. The owner shall be
provided a copy of such pre-tow hearing decision.
   (F)   Decision to tow and rates to be charged. If the preponderance of the
evidence supports towing and compliance with the provisions of this chapter,
the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and
storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner thereof. The fees to be charged
for towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates set by
the Village pursuant to the provisions of § 94.05 of this Code. The owner of
the vehicle having had such a hearing may avoid the towing by immediately
removing the vehicle from the improper location to a proper, lawful location
and correcting any unlawful condition of the vehicle.
   (G)   Decision not to tow. If the preponderance of the evidence fails to
support towing of the vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the
vehicle shall not be towed. The Village shall furnish a copy of such decision
to the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location plainly visible
from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window. No vehicle about which
such a decision has been rendered shall be towed by the municipality unless the
circumstances under which the decision was rendered have changed. If at some
subsequent time the Village should desire to tow the vehicle from the same
location, it shall follow the same procedures required for the towing of any
other similarly situated vehicle.
   (H)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions. Originals
or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports, and any
associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Village for a
period of at least 5 years after each hearing, or after each tow if no hearing
was requested or held.

§ 99.05 POST-TOW NOTICE FOR HAZARDOUS AND UNLAWFUL VEHICLES.
   (A)   Mailing or delivery of notice. Notice pursuant to this section shall
be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the
address of the owner of any unlawful vehicle or hazardous vehicle as indicated
in the most current registration list of the Secretary of State, unless the
notice is personally delivered to the owner, in which case the date and time of
the delivery and the name of the Village employee making the delivery shall be
included among the records or reports pertaining to the towing of the vehicle.
The notice shall be in the form as provided in § 94.07(A) and (B) and shall be
personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, to the address of the owner of the vehicle as indicated in the most
current registration list of the Secretary of State. In the event that the
Village has towed a hazardous or unlawful vehicle which is not registered in
the state, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall be made to the
Secretary of State of the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is registered, if
such jurisdiction can be reasonably determined, for the furnishing of the most
current registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice
shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished. If the owner of a
vehicle cannot be ascertained because the vehicle lacks a license plate,
vehicle identification number and any other markings or information identifying
the owner, then a notice shall be posted in the Village Hall describing the
vehicle, stating that the vehicle has been towed, the reason for the tow and
that the vehicle will be sold or otherwise disposed of if it is not claimed by
its owner.
   (B)   Requests for post-tow hearings. Requests for hearings may be made in
writing or orally at the office of the Village Manager. The request for a
hearing must be received by the office of the Village Manager within 15 days of
the mailing or personal delivery of the notification of tow, or release of the
vehicle, whichever occurs first; otherwise, the right to a hearing shall be
deemed waived.
   (C)   Release of motor vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled to
possession of any impounded vehicle shall be permitted to remove the vehicle,
the owner or other person entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of his
identity, ownership of the vehicle, or his right to possession, sign a receipt
for the vehicle, and pay the amount currently owed for towing and storage fees
and any applicable Village fees or penalties to the towing service operator.
The Village Manager is authorized to promulgate regulations as to the documents
or other proof necessary to establish these facts.
   (D)   Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates. The owner shall pay
fees to the towing service operator for towing and storage on police-ordered
tows at rates that do not exceed maximum amounts to be administratively
established by the Village Manager and which may be revised from time to time.
The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form and sign concerning
vehicle release requirements set forth in §
94.07(A). However, nothing in this chapter is intended to prevent a competitive
towing service operator from charging less than the established maximum rates
for police-ordered or any other tows. In arriving at the maximum rates for
various services, the Village Manager shall consider such matters as the
prevalent market rates in the area for the towing of different types of
vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements for categories such as
large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount
of work required to perform various types of towing operations. For
particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or serious
accidents, the Village Manager is authorized to allow towing operators to
charge rates above those established for normal situations, which special
charges must be based upon the cost of services provided, taking into account
such matters as the man-hours and equipment time required for the job. A towing
service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such a billing at
special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow and supply a copy of
the itemized bill to the owner and to the Village Manager. Any such special
rates charged must be customary in the towing industry in the area for the
nature and extent of the services provided. Every towing service operator and
the Police Department, the office of the Village Manager and the Building and
Code Enforcement Department shall have available a copy of the complete current
rate schedule and any special rate policy established by the Village Manager
for vehicle owners to view upon request. Included in the basic rate for each
tow originating with the Village shall be a $25 Village service fee. Such fee
shall be paid to the Village by approved tow service operators of the Village
on a monthly basis on or before the 10th day of the month following the month
in which the towed vehicle was released. In the event that a towed vehicle is
released by a tow service operator without the service fee having been
collected, the tow service operator shall remain liable to the Village for the
payment of such fee. The Village shall not be responsible for the collection of
receivables due for towing services performed by a tow service operator on
behalf of the village.

§ 99.06 POST-TOW HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Opportunity for hearing. The owner of a vehicle towed as an immediate
tow, by or pursuant to the authority set forth in § 94.02(A), shall be provided
the opportunity for a post-tow hearing to determine the validity of such tow
and any towing or storage charges. The hearing will not be determinative of, or
adjudicate, any citation issued relative to any towed vehicle.
   (B)   Nature of the hearing and Hearing Officer. The nature of the hearing
and the appointment of the Hearing Officer shall be the same as set forth above
in § 94.04(D) and (E).
   (C)   Scheduling of post-tow hearings. Hearings shall take place as follows:

the owner has properly requested a hearing, the hearing shall take place within
15 days after the release of such vehicle, unless the owner requests a later
date convenient to all parties;
      (2)   In those instances where the vehicle remains impounded, the hearing
shall take place, at the option of the owner:
         (a)   On the next day after an owner’s demand for such hearing,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, if such demand is made after 1500
hours (3:00 p.m.); or if the unavailability of a necessary witness or evidence
creates a particular difficulty in conducting the hearing on the next calendar
day, then a hearing shall be held on the second day following the request,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; or
         (b)   If acceptable to the owner, within 15 days of said request on a
date convenient to all parties.
   (D)   Conduct of post-tow hearing. The Hearing Officer shall review all
evidence presented by the vehicle owner and Village officers and employees and
shall make a finding based upon the preponderance of the evidence presented as

must establish such authority by a preponderance of the evidence.
   (E)   Post-tow hearing decision. For each hearing, the Hearing Officer shall
complete a post-tow hearing decision and supply a copy of the decision to the

post-tow hearing decision, set forth in § 94.09 of this Code.
   (F)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions. All
originals or copies of the notices, post-tow hearing decisions, towing reports,
and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Village
for a period of at least 5 years after each hearing, or after each tow if no
hearing was requested or held.
   (G)   Towing services subject to ordinance. Notwithstanding any other
ordinance or statutory provisions to the contrary, any towing service operator
authorized to perform tows on behalf of the Village must perform its services
subject to the provisions of this chapter.

a default against the Owner on the matters stated in the Post-Tow Notice. The
Owner is responsible for all towing and storage charges incurred to date, in

subtracting the appropriate amounts listed under paragraphs 1, 2, 3 or 4, the
final amount either owned by the Owner to date or to be refunded to the Owner

§ 101.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to establish
policies and procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the
Village's jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the Village
rights-of-way and the Village as a whole. In enacting this chapter, the Village
intends to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the Village and, in
particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by
establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility
facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the Village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (B)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (C)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The Village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   (D)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers.  In the event
that a utility (e.g., cable company, natural gas company, electric company,
etc.) other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (E)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict. This chapter also supplements the provisions of Title
IX (General Regulations) §
94.11 (Poles and Wires), §
94.13 (Openings and Stairways in Streets), §
94.18 (Vaults Under Street), §
94.19 (Excavations), §
94.22 (Restoration Bond Required for Work to be Performed on or Affecting
Public Improvements) and §
98.06 (Permits) and any other applicable provisions of this Code and the more
restrictive provisions of this Code shall control.
   (F)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (G)   Sound engineering judgment. The Village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the Village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

days after service of notice to the Village by the telecommunications retailer
in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or 25 days
after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
101.04 of this chapter, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) of this
section.
      (4)   Holders of state authorization under the Cable and Video
Competition Law of 2007. Applications by a utility that is a holder of a state-
issued authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be
deemed granted 45 days after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted
upon by the Village, provided the holder has complied with applicable Village
codes, ordinances, and regulations.

§ 101.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on Village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in or adjacent to the rights-of-
way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than 6 months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with
such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Business license required. All contractors and subcontractors
performing work or construction activities authorized by a permit issued by the
Village shall be properly licensed and bonded in accordance with the
requirements of this Code. Issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse
the contractors and subcontractors of the applicant from obtaining the proper
Village licenses to do business in the Village.
   (E)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the Village and all applicable federal, state, county and local statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations.

§ 101.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of "as-built" drawings or plans to the Village within 90
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with §
101.21 of this chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee, at its cost, shall either remove the facility from the right-of-
way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised
drawings or plans therefor.

§ 101.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying a right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and specifically naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officials,
officers, president and trustees, agents, employees, representatives,
consultants, attorneys, engineers and volunteers as additional insureds on the
policies listed in divisions (1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any 1
accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with
combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for
each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
NOTE: If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then the contractors and subcontractors
shall each comply with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the Village within 10 days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or
not to renew."
      (2)   Within 10 days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in
no event later than 10 days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A) or the requirements of divisions (B), (C), and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of
this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer"
under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be written under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance companies and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and be of a class size "X" or higher as rated by A.M. Best Company or any
similar insurer rating company.

§ 101.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected
and appointed officials, officers, president and trustees, agents, employees,
representatives, consultants, attorneys, engineers and volunteers harmless from
and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses
and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit or
defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result
from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or
misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of
the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this
chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however,
that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out
of or resulting solely and exclusively from the negligence, misconduct or
breach of this chapter by the Village, its officials, officers, president and
trustees, agents, employees, representatives, consultants, attorneys, engineers
and volunteers.
(Ord. C0-07-29, passed 8-21-2007; Am. Ord. C0-07-46, passed 11-6-2007)
§ 101.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to satisfy the items identified in
divisions (A) (1), (2) and (3) above and shall be determined by the Village
Engineer, in his discretion, based on estimated project costs as set forth in
the permittee's application. The restoration of the right-of-way shall be
performed to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Village Director of
Director of Code Enforcement, and may also include reasonable, directly related
costs, including attorney's fees, that the Village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. The reasonably
estimate cost as described above shall be multiplied by 125% to establish the
security fund amount. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the
permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with
each phase consisting of construction of facilities in 1 location or a related
group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase
or phases, the Director of Code Enforcement may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall
be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this division for any
single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The Village, upon 14 calendar days advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this division, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the
14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 calendar days after receipt of written notice
from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division
(C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit as confirmed by the Village, the permittee shall be
entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains
on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets
necessary to compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with
any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result
of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or
damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited.  The rights reserved to the Village with respect
to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village,
whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of any right with respect to said security fund shall
affect any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights, which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      (2)   Non-compliance with this chapter;
      (3)   The permittee's physical presence or presence of perrnittee's
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or
welfare; or
      (4)   The permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially
in accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   (B)   Notice of revocation or suspension. The Village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to permittee under this section.
   (C)   Permittee alternatives upon receipt of notice of revocation or
suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the Village, the permittee shall have the following options:
      (1)   Immediately provide the Village with evidence, that no cause exists
for the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the Village within 5 working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the Village, providing written proof of such removal to
the Village within 10 working days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation. The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend
the time periods provided in this division.
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of
this section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. 
      (1)   If the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of division
(C) above, the Village or its designee may, at the option of the Village:
         (a)   Correct the deficiencies;
         (b)   Upon not less than 20 days notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or
         (c)   After not less than 30 days notice to the permittee of failure
to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the Village.
      (2)   The permittee shall be liable in all events to the Village for all
costs of removal, storage or disposal of any equipment or facilities and any
contractor fees, consultant fees or attorney's fees and related expenses
incurred by the Village as a consequence of the permittee's failure or refusal
to comply with division (C) above.

§ 101.12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change.  A utility shall notify the Village no less
than 30 calendar days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership within 30 calendar days of assuming ownership
or control of the utility. If the new owner fails to have a new or amended
permit issued in its name within the 30-day period, the new owner shall be
presumed to have accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions
of the permit if the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the
Village's right-of-way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

§ 101.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division.
      (1)   No interference with Village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Building Director determines that the
proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
Village’s utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the Village’s utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
      (6)   New utility facilities (utility service cables, wires, ducts and
lines). All new service facilities, which include utility service cables,
wires, ducts and lines, that serve new customers within the Village that
traditionally are installed overhead shall be installed underground, at the
cost of the utility. Utilities may repair and replace existing overhead service
facilities without having to install such facilities underground, unless
underground placement is requested by the Village and the parties reach a
mutual agreement regarding the payment of the costs of the underground
installation.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of 2 feet (0.6 m) behind the face of the
curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of 4 feet (1.2 m) outside the outer
shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within 1 foot (0.3 m)
of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way tine.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than 5 feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line, and
any above-ground appurtenance shall be located within 1 foot (0.3 m) of the
right-of-way line or as near as practicable;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   The design parameters specified in this division (B)(2)(a) above
shall be used as guidelines to be followed in all cases unless special
circumstances, as determined by the Building Director, warrant consideration of
a variance.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   90-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at or
as near to a 90-degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC's
rules entitled "Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines" (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
         (b)   Poles are located within 1 foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         (b)   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 C.F.R. § 192.707
(1989)).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The Village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways. As part of its
application, the permittee shall be required to submit a site plan showing the
proposed location of the facilities for Village approval by the Building
Director when the permittee desires to locate any facilities in a public right-
of-way. The site plan shall be drawn to scale on a sheet not less than 8½
inches x 11 inches, which contains the location of property lines; location of
proposed facilities, all buildings, structures, improvements, fences, and paved
areas on immediately adjacent properties; location of each natural landscaping
area; the type of screening and landscape buffer to be installed around the
perimeter of the facilities, a list by scientific and common name of vegetative
species intended to be planted, cultivated, and maintained as part of the
landscape buffer; and the setback distance of the facilities and landscape
buffer that will be located near any property line. The Village may require
that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are not
highways, rather than within particular highways. The landscaping and screening
requirements specified herein are intended to foster aesthetically pleasing
improvements within rights-of-way which will protect and preserve the
appearance, character, health, safety, and welfare of the community.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The Village may restrict the location and size of any proposed
freestanding facility to be located within a right-of-way as part of the
approval of the application, the site plan and the landscape plan.
      (2)   Except for telephone poles and related wires, any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way shall be screened with earthen berms,
landscape materials or a solid wood or masonry fence or a combination of such
screening, as determined appropriate and necessary by the Building Director, to
effectively screen the facility from public view.
   (F)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The Village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality and appearance,
character, health, safety, and welfare of the community.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed or create a
safety hazard to pedestrians, bicycle riders and motorists using the right-of-
way or adjacent streets, parkways and sidewalks.
      (3)   All screening (fences) and landscape materials shall be maintained
in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance;
shall be replaced when dead or dying or in disrepair; and shall be kept free of
refuse and debris. The permittee shall be responsible for the maintenance,
repair and replacement of all required screening and landscape materials or may
contract with the Village to provide such services.
      (4)   Effective year-round landscape screening shall be provided to
lessen the visual prominence of facilities. Innovative landscape design
proposals that promote sustainability, reduce irrigation requirements, and that
utilize effective on site storm water management techniques are encouraged.
Thoughtful selection and placement of plant material based on ecological
principles are also encouraged.
   (G)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing (or substantially similar) design and color of utility poles
and light standards shall be used wherever practicable; the installation of
additional utility poles is strongly discouraged.
   (H)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.

the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shalt be continuous either
by 1-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
Village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within 1
foot (0.3m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or Village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the Village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated as approved by the Building Director.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The Village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
   (D)   Chemical use. No utility shall spray, inject or pour any chemicals on
or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation in the Village for any purpose,

within rights-of way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the Village and at the utility's expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking of equipment on the shoulder in order to make repair
operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the
shoulder in such an emergency will be permitted only when no other means of
access to the facility is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Building Director or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the utility shall immediately notify the Village police.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the Village a

§ 101.21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from 1 or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the Building
Director as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each
provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons
why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Building Director shall decide on an
individual basis whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this
chapter identified in the variance request.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Building Director may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform to the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for

§ 110.01 LICENSES REQUIRED.
   (A)   It is the intent of this chapter to require that all business,
commercial and industrial activities in the Village of whatever nature except
those listed in §
110.18 obtain a license to operate. The requirement of a general business
license and the imposition of a fee therefor is intended:
      (1)   To provide the Village with complete identifying information
concerning businesses and their owners and the owners of the premises on which
the businesses are located, in order to protect the business in case of
emergency, and to protect the public and other businesses in case of complaints
alleging unsanitary or unsafe conditions;
      (2)   To reimburse the Village for the cost of administering the license
regulations of the Village to the extent that such cost is not paid by license
fees received for the issuance of other licenses provided for under this Code;
and
      (3)   To provide reimbursement to the Village for the cost of inspections
and investigations conducted by Village personnel for businesses not licensed
under other sections of this Code.
   (B)   No person, firm or corporation not otherwise licensed by this Code
except those engaged in a business listed in §
110.18 shall engage in any commercial, business or industrial activity of
whatever kind in the Village without first having obtained a general business
license as provided in this section. Application for a general business license
shall be made in conformance with the requirements of §
110.03 relating to applications for licenses.
   (C)   General business licenses shall be of 4 types:
      (1)   Type “A” general business licenses shall require the payment of a
fee of $200 and shall apply to retail businesses which regularly invite the
public into their establishment for the purpose of providing goods and
services, and to other businesses which are subject to substantial regulation
by this Code and which require substantial investigation and an inspection
prior to the issuance of a license or during its term;
      (2)   Type “B” general business licenses shall require the payment of a
fee of $100. Type “B” licenses shall apply to all businesses in the Village
which consist solely of an office, provided goods are not actually transferred
within the office;
      (3)   Type “C” general business licenses shall require the payment of a
fee of $100 and shall apply to all businesses required to be licensed under
this section and not included in Type “A,” Type “B” or “industrial
establishment” licenses. In general, Type “C” general business licenses shall
apply to businesses other than mere offices, retail businesses and
manufacturing establishments which do not require substantial investigation and
inspection by the Village and are not subject to substantial regulation under
this Code;
      (4)   "Industrial establishment" licenses shall apply to those businesses
which occupy a building or premises or a portion thereof, the principal use of
which is for manufacturing, including assembly, processing, fabrication and
storage or scientific research and development. The license fee for industrial
establishment licenses shall be the applicable fee set forth in §
110.13 of this Code.
   (D)   The Building Director shall make the initial determination as to
whether each applicant for a general business license shall be required to
obtain a Type “A,” Type “B,” Type “C” or “industrial establishment” license. He
shall make his determination after reviewing the information provided in each
application in light of the factors noted in division (C) above, and the intent
of the section that businesses subject to substantial regulation under this
Code shall pay their share of the cost of the Village business regulation
program and that businesses licensed primarily for registration and information
gathering purposes shall pay a nominal fee or no fee. The decision of the
Building Director in this matter may be appealed to the Village Manager, whose
decision shall be final.

   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically provided, upon receipt of an

any department or board of the Village, and the approval thereof as to the
character or fitness of any applicant for a license, or as to the proper
location or condition of the premises in which the business for which a license
is applied is to be managed, conducted, operated or carried on, the Director of
Finance shall transmit to each department or board charged with the
investigation and approval of any such application such information as may be
necessary in order that the required investigation or inspection may be made.
Each department head or president of a board charged with such investigation or
inspection shall, immediately upon receipt of such information from the
Director of Finance, cause an investigation or inspection to be made and shall,
within 10 calendar days after the receipt of the information from the Director
of Finance, either approve or disapprove the issuance of such license and shall
notify the Director of Finance accordingly.
   (B)   Upon receiving satisfactory proof from the Director of Finance that
the applicant or each of the principal officers, if the applicant is a
corporation, is a fit and proper person to be granted such license, and that
all laws and provisions of this chapter, title and code regulating the business
or occupation for which such license is applied for have been complied with,
the Village President, or his or her designee, may authorize the issuance of
the license by the Village Clerk.

after approval by the Building Director as to compliance with all applicable
Codes, ordinances, rules and regulations of the Village, be accompanied by the
full amount of the fee payable for such license.
   (B)   Whenever a license cannot be issued at the time the application for
the same is made, the Director of Finance shall issue a receipt to the
applicant for the money paid in advance. All such receipts shall have plainly
indicated thereon that the receipt of payment of the license fee is not to be
construed as the issuance of a license.
   (C)   No such receipt, or the payment of any license fee in advance of the
issuance of the license in due form, shall entitle or authorize any person to
any of the rights or privileges conferred by the issuance of any license or to
the opening or maintaining of any business or establishment contrary to any of
the provisions of this chapter.
(197 Code, § 31.05) (Ord. 77-9, passed 7-9- 1977; Am. Ord. 83-9, passed 5-26-

in accordance with the provisions of this chapter governing the issuance of
such license; provided, however, that failure on the part of the Director of
Finance to cause such notice to be mailed to each licensee shall not be deemed
a defense to a suit brought by the Village to recover the penalty for a
violation of the provision of this chapter under which the licensee is required
to obtain a license.
   (B)   Except where otherwise specifically provided, the Director of Finance
may authorize the renewal of any license at the beginning of the license year.

§ 111.36 LIVE ENTERTAINMENT LICENSE.
   (A)   Purpose and definition. It is recognized that noise generated by live
music or similar live entertainment events, whatever the duration, may
negatively impact and create a hazard to the public health, safety and welfare
of nearby residents, businesses and the general public, and that it is
therefore necessary to place reasonable regulations on such entertainment
events through adoption of a licensing system that balances the interests of
all parties. For purposes of this chapter, LIVE ENTERTAINMENT shall mean a
musical, DJ, theatrical, dance, cabaret, comedy or similar act performed live
(or in the case of a DJ, playing recorded music), by 1 or more persons for the
purpose of entertaining customers. A live entertainment license is secondary to
the principal business uses of a location, including a restaurant or special
event space. A charge or fee may or may not be charged at the business with a
secondary license for live entertainment.
   (B)   Eligibility. Live entertainment licenses may be issued accessory to
the operation of a restaurant, special event space or other establishment
within the Village’s business districts in conjunction with the requirements
and regulations set forth in this section,
Chapter 110 of this Code, and the Village’s zoning code.
   (C)   General regulations.
      (1)   Any restaurant, special event space or other establishment desiring
to hold live entertainment events as part of its operations shall apply for and
obtain an accessory live entertainment license from the Village. Except as part
of a special event approved by the Village, no live entertainment events may be
held at a restaurant, special event space or other establishment within the
business districts of the Village except upon issuance of an accessory live
entertainment license and in full compliance with this section.
      (2)   All live entertainment events, regardless of whether an accessory
live entertainment license is issued or required, must comply with state law
and this Code, including, but not limited to, the regulations set forth in this
chapter, and the noise regulations set forth in §§
92.30 and
130.21 of this Code.
      (3)   Live entertainment events must end no later than 1 hour prior to
closing each day or, where the licensed establishment holds a liquor license, 1
hour prior to the time liquor can no longer be served each day, whichever is
earlier, or as otherwise specified in a license issued.
      (4)   Live entertainment events must be conducted in a manner that
respects the comfort, convenience, safety, health and welfare of nearby
residents, businesses and/or the general public.
      (5)   Unless otherwise specifically approved by the Village, live
entertainment events shall occur indoors, and, with the exception of persons
entering or leaving the premises, the doors and windows of the establishment
must remain closed at all times while live entertainment events are taking
place.
      (6)   Unless otherwise specifically approved by the Village, no speakers
for listening to live entertainment events taking place inside may be placed in
the outdoor area or on the exterior of the premises.
      (7)   The fee for a live entertainment license shall be as set forth in §
110.13 of this Code.
      (8)   The Director of Code Enforcement and the Fire Chief may cause such
investigation to be made as in their judgment is deemed necessary for the
purpose of determining whether the premises occupied by the applicant for a
license under this section comply with the Village ordinances relating to
health, safety and sanitation so as to properly safeguard the lives and health
of the employees engaged and patrons enjoying live entertainment therein; and
if from such investigation, they find that such applicant has failed to comply
with the fire prevention, sanitary and health regulations of the Village, or
with the general ordinances thereof relating to such business, they shall
immediately report the same in writing to the Village President who shall
refuse to issue such license.
      (9)   The performance area(s), stage(s) and equipment staging areas used
for live entertainment events shall not block fire exits or fire exit access
paths nor block pedestrian access to those portions of Village streets,
sidewalks or rights-of-way that are open for public use.
      (10)   All live entertainment events must comply with the state laws and
this Code, including but not limited to, the regulations set forth in this
chapter.
      (11)   Any conditions required by the corporate authorities of the
Village as part of the approval of an ordinance granting or renewing a liquor
license associated with the establishment or event where the live entertainment
is taking place.
   (D)   Procedure.
      (1)   Applications. Applicants for accessory live entertainment licenses
are required to submit the following:
         (a)   A completed application on a form provided by the Village, which
shall include the anticipated number of live entertainment events per year, the
hours during which live entertainment will generally take place, and a
description of the nature of the live entertainment generally proposed to be

         (b)   An accessory live entertainment license fee as determined by the
Village from time to time and as set forth in §
110.13 of this Code;
         (c)   A site plan drawn to accurately illustrate the stage or other
area where live entertainment will take place on the premises and the location

      (2)   Review. Once a completed application has been received by the

of submittal or receipt of any additional items requested by the Village and/or
the completion of any consultations with staff deemed necessary by the Village.
      (4)   Fire prevention and health requirements. The Director of Code
Enforcement and the Fire Chief may cause such investigation to be made as in
their judgment is deemed necessary for the purpose of determining whether the
premises occupied by the applicant for a license under this section comply with
the Village ordinances relating to health, safety and sanitation so as to
properly safeguard the lives and health of the employees engaged and patrons
enjoying live entertainment therein; and if from such investigation, they find
that such applicant has failed to comply with the fire prevention, sanitary and
health regulations of the Village, or with the general ordinances thereof
relating to such business, they shall immediately report the same in writing to
the Village Manager who shall refuse to issue such license.
      (5)   Denial. License applications may be denied by the Village Manager
in cases where:
         (a)   The application is incomplete or otherwise deficient;
         (b)   The property or business owner is delinquent on any fees, fines,
penalties or delinquencies he or she owes to the Village (and no appeal has
been filed); or
         (c)   The Village Manager makes a determination, based on tangible
evidence, that allowing the live music or entertainment would adversely affect
the comfort, convenience, safety, health and welfare of nearby residents,
businesses and/or the general public. Factors that the Village Manager may
consider in making a determination under this division (H)(5)(c) include:
            1.   The anticipated volume of the live entertainment;
            2.   The proposed times during which the proposed live
entertainment shall be provided;
            3.   The location of the establishment in relation to residential
areas and other commercial establishments;
            4.   A history of complaints, citations and/or violations of the
Village’s noise regulations or other code violations relative to the requesting
establishment; and/or
            5.   Other factors associated with public health and welfare,
security and safety of the event participants, nearby residents or businesses,
and the general public, including, but not limited to, parking, traffic
congestion, and security and public safety.
      (6)   Conditions. In addition to all conditions and requirements set
forth in this chapter, the Village Manager may attach such conditions to a live
music or entertainment license as are deemed necessary to balance the interests
of the public with the holding of live music or entertainment events within the
Village. Failure to comply with all conditions set forth in a live music or
entertainment license is a violation of this section.
      (7)   Appeal. The Village Manager’s decision on a license application or
imposition of particular conditions may be appealed by the applicant to the
Village Board of Trustees by submitting a written request to appeal to the
office of the Village Clerk within 5 days of notification of the denial or
license conditions. An appeal shall be considered at the next regular meeting
of the Board of Trustees or at such other time deemed appropriate by the Board
of Trustees. On appeal, the Board of Trustees may affirm, reverse or modify the
ruling of the Village Manager.
      (8)   Renewals. Annual license renewals, provided no or minimal changes
are requested and there has been no history of violations of the noise
regulations or other Village codes and ordinances during the preceding year,
may be approved upon request for renewal on a form provided by the Village and
payment of the annual license fee.
      (9)   Modifications, suspensions and revocations.
         (a)   Licenses issued under this chapter are subject to suspension,
modification or revocation at any time after issuance by the Village Manager.
Notice of a possible license suspension, modification or revocation and the
basis therefor shall be mailed to the licensee, addressed to them at their last
known place of business. A licensee shall have 10 days from the date of the
notice to request a hearing before the Village Manager or their designee.
         (b)   If the licensee fails to request a hearing, or requests a
hearing and the Village Manager determines after a hearing that either: a) the
holding of live music and entertainment events at a licensed establishment has
been consistently detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of
persons residing or working near the establishment holding the live
entertainment events; b) there are violations of any license conditions or the
requirements of this chapter: c) the licensed establishment has failed to
timely pay any fees, fines, penalties or delinquencies owed to the Village; or
d) other good cause for suspension, modification or revocation of a license
exists, they may, in their discretion and without further notice, take action
to suspend the license for a specified period of time, modify any conditions of
the license or impose new conditions, including imposition of a probationary
period, or revoke the license. Any 3 findings of guilt in a 12- month period on
citations issued for violations of the Village’s noise regulations set forth in
§§
92.30 and
130.21 of this Code shall constitute prima facie evidence that the holding of
live entertainment events at said licensed establishment is detrimental to the
health, safety or general welfare of persons residing or working near the
establishment.
         (c)   The decision of the Village Manager following a hearing is
appealable to the Board of Trustees by the licensee in the same manner as an
initial license decision by the Village Manager. No appeal on the substance of
a decision may be taken from a decision of the Village Manager where a licensee
failed to request or attend a hearing.
   (E)   Penalties.
      (1)   Any person or entity violating or found liable under any of the
provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, a failure to obtain
a live entertainment license, or a violation of any conditions set forth in a
live entertainment license, shall be subject to a penalty of not less than $75
nor more than $750 for a first violation within the past 12 months, not less
than $150 nor more than $750 for a second violation within the past 12 months,
and not less than $300 nor more than $750 for a third or subsequent offense
within the past 12 months. A separate offense shall be deemed committed with
each recurrence of a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   In addition, the appropriate authorities of the Village may take
such other action as they deem proper to enforce the terms and conditions of
this chapter, including, without limitation, an action in equity to compel
compliance with its terms.

thereof is imposed on the transfer of the title to real estate located within
the Village and on the assignment of a beneficial interest in a land trust
which holds title to real estate located within the Village, as evidenced by
the recordation of a deed. The real estate transfer tax imposed by this section
shall be levied and paid in addition to any other taxes which may be imposed on
the transfer of real estate. The real estate transfer tax imposed by this
section shall be paid by the grantor, seller or assignor prior to the
recordation of the deed.
      (2)   Nothing in this section prohibits the purchaser, grantee or
assignee in a real estate transaction from agreeing with a seller, grantor, or
assignor, either:

purchaser’s, grantee’s or assignee’s obligation to pay the tax imposed by this
section.

title shall be subject to the lien provided in division (I) of this section.

deed that is otherwise exempt under this division (E)(6) is required to file
the deed with the Cook County Recorder of Deeds Office within 14 days of the
date set forth in the deed and failure to file the deed during said 14-day time
period will subject the person to a $500 penalty, to be paid to the Village

Village the penalty imposed herein within 21 days of the issuance of a written
demand by the Village, the Village may, in its discretion, declare a lien
against the real property that is the subject of the deed in the amount of the
penalty. The lien may be enforced by a proceeding to foreclose as in the case
of a mortgage lien. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the Village
from bringing a civil action to collect the penalty imposed pursuant to this
division (E)(6) from any person who has the ultimate liability for payment of
same, including interest and penalties and payment of reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs;
      (7)   Transactions made pursuant to mergers, consolidations, or transfers
or sales of substantially all of the assets of a corporation pursuant to a plan

pursuant to the authority vested in the President of the United States by the
Trading With The Enemy Act, § 5(d), as amended by the First War Powers Act;
      (8)   From trustees to surviving, substitute, succeeding or additional
trustees of the same trust, or upon the death of a joint tenant to the survivor
or survivors.
   (G)   Procedure for collection of tax, certificate of compliance required.
The real estate transfer tax imposed by this section shall be collected by the
Director of Finance. Upon payment of the real estate transfer tax, any
outstanding water bill, and any other debt due and owing to the Village, the
deed involved in the transaction shall be stamped with a stamp which states
that the Village real estate transfer tax has been paid, the amount of tax paid
and the date of payment. The absence of such a stamp on a deed shall be prima
facie evidence that the real estate transfer tax imposed by this section has
not been paid. The Director of Finance shall not accept payment of the real
estate transfer tax and shall not issue the transfer stamp until he or she is
presented with a statement from the Director of Community Development which
states that an occupancy affidavit has been received from the purchaser,
grantee or assignee pursuant to §
150.098(N) of this Code, and either that a conditional certificate of
compliance or certificate of compliance has been issued with respect to the
real estate being transferred in accordance with §
150.098, that the property is uninspected property pursuant to §
150.098, or that a certificate of compliance is not required by §
150.098. A copy of the completed, fully executed, occupancy affidavit shall
accompany the statement from the Director of Community Development. If the
Director of Community Development states that a certificate of compliance is
not required, then the Director of Finance shall not accept payment of the real
estate transfer tax and shall not issue the transfer stamp until he or she is
presented with a statement from the Water Department that there are no
delinquent unpaid bills for water the Village provided to the real estate being
transferred and a statement from the Director of Community Development that
there are no outstanding Village liens or judgments against the property.
   (H)   A signed copy of the real estate transfer declaration filed pursuant
to the Real Estate Transfer Tax Law, 35 ILCS 200/31-25, shall be filed with the
Director of Finance by the purchaser, grantee, or assignee within 10 days after
delivery of a deed, or at the time of payment of the real estate transfer tax
imposed by this section, whichever occurs first.
   (I)   Lien created; enforcement. In the event a deed is filed for
recordation without payment of the real estate transfer tax imposed by this
section, a lien is declared against the real estate involved in the transfer in
the amount of the tax. The fact that the deed does not contain the stamp
described in division (K) of this section shall constitute constructive notice
of the lien. The lien may be enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in the
case of mortgages or mechanics liens. Suit to foreclose the lien must be
commenced within 3 years after the date of recording the deed. Nothing herein
shall be construed as preventing the Village from bringing a civil action to
collect the tax imposed in this section from any person who has the ultimate
liability for payment of the same, including interest and penalties as herein
provided.
   (J)   Enforcement; suit for collection. Whenever any person shall fail to
pay the real estate transfer tax imposed by this section in accordance with
this section, the Village Attorney shall, upon request of the Village Manager,
bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of said tax,
including interest and penalties as specified in division (K) of this section,
on behalf of the Village and any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (K)   Interest and penalties. In the event of the failure by any person to
the Director of Finance the tax required hereunder when the same shall be due,
interest shall accumulate and be due upon said tax at the rate of 1.5% per
month commencing as of the first day following the day when the tax became due.
In addition, a penalty of 10% of the tax and interest due shall be assessed and
collected against any person who shall fail to pay the tax imposed by this
section when due.
   (L)   Proceeds of tax. All proceeds resulting from the imposition of the
real estate transfer tax under this section, including interests and penalties,
shall be deposited into the Treasury of the Village and shall be credited to
and deposited in the General Fund of the Village.
   (M)   (1)   The applicable real estate transfer tax rate for transfers
involving charitable organizations whose primary mission focuses on providing
or building affordable housing within the Village shall be reduced by 50% in
accordance with the provisions of this division. To be eligible for a reduction
under this division, either the buyer or seller must:
         (a)   Be an organization that has been found by the Internal Revenue
Service to be an "exempt organization" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (b)   Provide proof (e.g., corporate documents) to the Village's
Finance Department that its primary mission focuses on the provision of
affordable housing; and
         (c)   Provide proof (e.g., building plans) that the real estate being
conveyed shall be improved
with affordable housing by the purchaser for resale to the public or the real
estate has been improved with affordable housing by the seller.
      (2)   The definition of AFFORDABLE HOUSING as contained in this division
shall be the same as used in the Illinois Affordable Housing Act (310 ILCS 65/
1 et seq.). In the event that a person acquires real estate for purposes of
building or providing affordable housing and the seller or purchaser receives a
50% reduction in the applicable real estate transfer tax for the transaction
under this division, the person who then seeks to sell or convey the real
estate shall be responsible at the time of sale or conveyance for paying to the
Village the dollar amount equal to the 50% reduction in the real estate
transfer tax applied to the prior real estate transaction plus the applicable
real estate transfer tax on the sale or conveyance of the real estate if the
person does not build or offer affordable housing on the real estate.
   (N)   Penalty. In addition to any other penalties imposed by this section,
any person found guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction of violating any
provision of this section shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not
less than $200 nor more than $1,000 for each violation.
   (O)   Release of lien. The Village may authorize the preparation and filing
of liens against title to real estate as well as the preparation and filing of
releases of any lien imposed under this section and this Code. Any person
liable under this section shall be obligated to pay to the Village the amount
of the real estate transfer tax plus any incurred interest or penalties or any
lien amounts filed against the real estate imposed under this chapter and all
expenses and costs incurred by the Village with respect to collection of the
debt, subject to adjustment by the Village Manager, or his or her designee. In
order to obtain a release of a Village lien, the following payment to the
Village is required: (a) $50 for the preparation, handling and filing costs of
the Village lien or the actual costs, if greater: and (b) $50 for the
preparation, handling and filing costs of the release of Village lien or the
actual costs, if greater.

§ 116.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.
   The Village President and Board of Trustees expressly find and declare that:
   (A)   (1)   Cigarette smoking is dangerous to human health;
      (2)   There exists substantial scientific evidence that the use of
tobacco products causes cancer, heart disease and various other medical
disorders;
      (3)   The Surgeon General of the United States has declared that nicotine
addiction from tobacco is similar to addiction to cocaine, and is the most
widespread example of drug dependence in this country;
      (4)   The Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse concluded that
the majority of Americans who die each year from cigarette smoking became
addicted to nicotine as adolescents before the age of legal consent;
      (5)   The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cigarette smoking
precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug use; and
      (6)   The Village finds that establishing a minimum sales age of 21 for
the legal purchase and sale of tobacco products will reduce smoking and tobacco
use among youth and young adults, and decrease the likelihood that persons
under the age of 21 will become smokers or electronic cigarette users later in
life.
   (B)   The enactment of this chapter directly pertains to and is in
furtherance of the health, welfare and safety of the residents of the Village,
particularly those residents under 21 years of age.

to the approval of the President and Board of Trustees and the Local Liquor
Control Commissioner. A special event liquor license is not required for a

proposed special event requires the issuance of a Class C liquor license. The
pre-application letter shall contain sufficient facts regarding the special

Control Commissioner's determination relative to any special event shall be
made on a case by case basis and shall be limited to that particular special
event as described in the pre-application letter. A decision by the Local
Liquor Control Commissioner that a Class C liquor license is required for a
special event is not an approval of a Class C liquor license. The decision by

§ 117.27 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   (A)   A license shall be purely a personal privilege, good for not to exceed
1 year after issuance unless sooner revoked as provided in this chapter, and
shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject to attachment,
garnishment or execution, nor shall it be alienable or transferable,
voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or hypothecated.
Except as provided in division (B) of this section, such license shall not
descend by the laws of testate or intestate devolution, but shall cease upon
the death of the licensee; provided, however, that executors or administrators
of the estate of any deceased licensee, and the trustee of any insolvent or
bankrupt licensee, when such estate consists in part of alcoholic liquor under
order of the appropriate court, may exercise the privileges of the deceased or
insolvent or bankrupt's license after the death of such descendent, or such
insolvency or bankruptcy until the expiration of such license but not longer
than 6 months after the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of such licensee.
   (B)   (1)   A license may, upon the licensee's death, descend only to the
licensee's spouse or children and in the event such licensee is not survived by
a spouse or child then to the licensee's mother or father; provided, however,
any such survivor must possess the same qualifications required by the deceased
licensee. The passage of a license pursuant to the terms of this subsection
shall not require the payment of any fees.
      (2)   Nothing contained in this subsection shall create any vested or
property right in any liquor license in any person whatsoever, nor shall it
limit or restrict the right of the Village to at any time amend or repeal this
subsection.
   (C)   Except as otherwise provided herein and in division (J), when the
licensee is a partnership or a corporation whose stock is not publicly traded
on a recognized stock exchange, the license shall terminate whenever 50% or
more of the ownership interest therein changes from that shown on the original
license application. Prior to a transfer of 50% or more of the ownership, the
partnership or corporation, through its officers/partners, shall submit a
complete application and the required fees for the issuance of a new license,
as provided herein, and said application is subject to approval by the Board of
the Trustees and the Local Liquor Control Commissioner, in their sole
discretion, and such approval is necessary for the new corporate ownership to
sell and/or serve alcoholic beverages.
   (D)   When the licensee is a corporation whose stock is publicly traded on a
recognized stock exchange, the license shall terminate whenever 50% or more of
the membership of the Board of Directors of the corporation changes from that
shown on the original license application, or whenever 1 person who was not
shown as an owner of 50% or more of the ownership interest in the publicly-
traded corporation at the time of the original liquor license application,
becomes an owner of a 50% or more ownership interest in the publicly-traded
corporation. In such event, the corporation, through its officers/Board of
Directors, must make application for the issuance of a new license as provided
in this chapter.
   (E)   When the licensee is a partnership or corporation, no change in
ownership from that shown on the original application involving the addition of
a new partner(s) of such partnership or a new shareholder(s) who will own in
the aggregate more than 5% of the stock of such corporation, shall be effective
until such proposed change in ownership has first been reported in writing to
the Local Liquor Control Commissioner along with a completed liquor license
application. Such application shall be submitted to the Liquor Control
Commission for review as to the new partner or shareholder’s eligibility to
hold a liquor license. The Commission shall make a recommendation to the Local
Liquor Control Commissioner regarding such eligibility. After receiving such
recommendation, the Commissioner shall determine whether the proposed new
partner(s) or shareholder(s) is/are eligible under the provisions of §
117.22 of this chapter and shall so advise the licensee of their determination
in writing. Any change in ownership without complying with the terms hereof
shall constitute grounds for a fine and/or the suspension or revocation of the
liquor license issued to such partnership or corporation.
   (F)   When the licensee is a corporation whose stock is publicly traded on a
recognized stock exchange, no change in the membership of the Board of
Directors of the corporation from that shown on the original application
involving the addition of a new Director of such corporation shall be effective
until such proposed change in Directors has first been reported in writing to
the Local Liquor Control Commissioner and the Commissioner finds that the
proposed new Director is not ineligible under the provisions of § 
117.22 of this chapter and so advises the licensee in writing. Any change in
the membership of the Board of Directors without complying with the terms
hereof shall constitute grounds for a fine and/or suspension or revocation of
the liquor license issued to such corporation.
   (G)   When the licensee is a partnership or corporation whose stock is not
publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange, no change in ownership from
that shown on the original application involving the withdrawal of any partner
or shareholder shall be made without reporting such change in ownership in
writing to the Local Liquor Control Commissioner within 10 days of any such
change in ownership. Any such change in ownership made without complying with
the terms hereof shall constitute grounds for a fine and/or the suspension or
revocation of the liquor license issued to such partnership or corporation.
   (H)   When the licensee is a corporation whose stock is publicly traded on a
recognized stock exchange, no change in the membership of the Board of
Directors from that shown on the original application involving the withdrawal,
removal or elimination of any Director shall be made without reporting such
change in the membership of the Board of Directors in writing to the Local
Liquor Control Commissioner within 10 days of any such change. Any such change
in the membership of the Board of Directors made without complying with the
terms hereof shall constitute grounds for a fine and/or the suspension or
revocation of the liquor license issued to such corporation.
   (I)   (1)   In the event that a liquor license is granted to a corporation
which issues franchises relative to its business locations, the liquor license
issued to the corporation may be transferred to an authorized franchisee,
notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, provided the following
conditions are met:

corporation, the Board of Trustees may grant an extension of the 180 days
limitation upon a showing of good cause as to why the transfer could not occur
within the initial 180-day period.
      (2)   Provided all the foregoing conditions are met, the liquor license
may be transferred to the franchisee upon payment of transfer fee which shall
be calculated based on the following formula:

      (3)   If at any time after the transfer of the liquor license to the
franchisee there is a change in the franchisee, it shall be the obligation of

this section.
   (B)   General requirements for taximeters. The dial of every taximeter shall
show only 1 fare. Each taximeter shall also properly and accurately register,
indicate and display the fare which has accrued. In addition, each taximeter
shall also properly and accurately register, indicate and display the time
consumed by the taxicab while in waiting. Each taximeter shall be equipped with
a flag at least 3 inches by 2 inches in size, either painted red or bearing
thereon in letters at least 1 inch in height, the word “vacant” or the words
“for hire.” The flag post of such flag shall be kept up or toward a vertical
position when the taxicab is for hire. When a taxicab is engaged in the service
of a passenger or passengers, such flag pole shall be kept down or in a
horizontal position.
   (C)   Placement of taximeter. Each taximeter must be placed in a taxicab so
that it is in plain view of the passengers. Each taxicab shall, during the
period between sunset and sunrise, be equipped with a light which shall
illuminate the taximeter so as to enable the passengers within such taxicab to
read the figures indicated on the taximeter.
   (D)   Testing. Every taximeter shall be tested by running the taxicab to
which it is attached over a course of a standard mile in length or by a
mechanical test to prove the accuracy of the register thereof. Either of the
foregoing tests may be made in the discretion of the person making the
inspection. In order to determine whether such taximeter correctly registers
“waiting time” it shall be the duty of the person inspecting the taximeter to
test the taximeter by comparing the timing quoted as shown by the fare computed
on the dial of the taximeter with the standard time. It shall be the duty of
each taxicab company to deliver, upon request from the Building Director,
either the taxicab together with the taximeter, or the taximeter attached
therefrom to the person and place specified by the Building Director for the
purpose of testing.
   (E)   Sealing of taximeters. All taximeters found accurate and correct are
to be sealed. The Building Director shall keep a record of the numbers of each
taximeter, the vehicle license of the cab in which each taximeter is installed
and the date on which the taximeter was last inspected.
   (F)   Use of unsealed taximeters prohibited. No taxicab company shall permit
a taxicab to be operated which is equipped with a taximeter, whose case is
unsealed. No taxicab driver shall drive a taxicab equipped with a taximeter
whose case is unsealed.
   (G)   Transfer of taximeters. No person shall detach any certified or
inspected taximeter from any taxicab and attach the same to any other taxicab
unless the taximeter is first inspected and resealed.
   (H)   False signals. No taxicab driver while transporting passengers shall
display the signal affixed to the taxicab’s taximeter in such a position as to
denote that he is employed at a rate of fare different from that to which he is
entitled under the provisions of this section.
(1997 Code, § 36.06) (Ord. 83-7, passed 4-28- 1983; Am. Ord. CO-09-27, passed

§ 118.07 TAXICAB STANDS.
   Only taxicabs in such numbers and of such kinds as set forth on the required
metal sign may remain at a taxicab stand while waiting for employment and only
in single file pointed in accordance with the applicable traffic regulations.
No taxicab standing at the head of any such line shall refuse to carry any
orderly person applying for a taxicab who agrees to pay the proper fare. This
will not prevent any person from electing any taxicab he may desire, whether it
be at the head of the line or not. As the taxicabs leave the line with
passengers, those behind shall move up. Taxicabs seeking a place on the line
shall approach the same only from the rear of the stand and shall stop as near
as possible to the last cab already on the line.

siting of wireless communication facilities, towers, antennas and equipment.
The goals of this chapter are to:
   (A)   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts
of towers and antennas;
   (B)   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas:
      (1)   Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
      (2)   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers;
      (3)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
      (4)   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
manner that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas
through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
      (5)   Enhance the ability of the providers of communications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
      (6)   Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and
      (7)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. To further these
goals, the Village shall give due consideration to the comprehensive plan,
zoning map, existing land uses, historic and environmentally sensitive areas in
approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.

(Ord. CO-2010-006, passed 4-15-2010; Am. Ord. 2018-33, passed 7-17-2018)
§ 120.04 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use of an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or
tower on such lot.
   (B)   Lot size. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with the development regulations of the zoning
district in which the facility is located, including but not limited to setback
requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the
dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers
may be located on leased parcels within such lot. For the purpose of this
chapter, the dimensions of an entire lot of record shall control the
development regulations, even though the communication facility may be located
on leased parcels within such lot.
   (C)   Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or
tower shall provide to the Director of Community Development an inventory of
its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that
are either within the jurisdiction of the Village or within 1 mile of the
Village borders, including specific information about the location, height, and
design of each tower. The Director of Community Development may share such
information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or
special use permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate
antennas within the jurisdiction of the Village, provided, however that the
Director of Community Development is not, by sharing such information, in any
way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.
   (D)   Signs. No advertising design or media shall be placed upon an antenna,
tower, equipment structure, building or site.
   (E)   Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by
the FAA or other applicable authority.
      (1)   If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design
chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. It shall be
shielded or directed to the greatest extent possible in such a manner as to
minimize the amount of light that falls onto nearby properties, particularly
residential properties.
      (2)   When incorporated into the approved design of the tower, light
fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking lots, or similar areas may be
attached to the tower.
      (3)   In residential districts, any exterior lights shall be kept off
except when personnel are actually present at night.
   (F)   State or federal requirements. All towers, support facilities and
telecommunications services must meet or exceed current standards and
regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal
government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas, including the
requirements regarding installation of emergency generators at each tower site
(see §
120.11(J)), and shall not interfere with public safety and other Village and
private telecommunications operations. If such standards and regulations are
changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this chapter
shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with revised standards and
regulations within 6 months of the effective date, unless a different
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency.
Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owner's expense.
   (G)   Building codes/safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance
with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes and the
applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the Village
concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice to the tower
owner, the owner shall have 30 days to bring the tower into compliance with
such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within 30 days
shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's
expense.
   (H)   Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks and
separation distances shall be calculated and applied to facilities located in
the Village irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries.
   (I)   Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this chapter and shall not be regulated or permitted as
essential services, public utilities, or private utilities.
   (J)   Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall
certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or
operation of a wireless communication system in the Village have been obtained
and shall file a copy of all required franchises with the Director of Community
Development.
   (K)   Public notice. For purposes of this chapter, any special use request,
variance request, or appeal of an administratively approved use or special use
shall require public notice to all abutting property owners and all property
owners of properties that are located within the corresponding separation
distance listed in §
120.19(B) (Table 2, Separation Distances Between Towers), in addition to any
notice otherwise required by the Zoning Ordinance.
   (L)   Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support equipment
associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of §
120.11 (Buildings and Other Equipment Storage).
   (M)   Multiple antenna/tower plan. The Village encourages tower and antenna
users to submit a single application for approval of multiple towers and/or
antenna sites. Applications for approval of multiple sites shall be given
priority in the review process.
   (N)   Height. The height limitation in all zoning districts for new tower
construction is 100 feet, unless the height limitation is increased by the
Village Board as part of a special use permit process. The maximum height of
any tower, antenna or personal wireless service facility shall be certified by
the applicant's engineer as part of the application. The Village Board may
increase the maximum height restriction as part of the special use permit
approval process if the goals of this chapter would be better served by the
adjustment. Two primary (but not exhaustive) criteria for consideration of
allowing an increase in the maximum tower height above 100 feet as part of a
special use permit process are as follows: a study certified by a professional
engineer demonstrates that the tower height needs to be increased in order to
allow the personal wireless facilities and related service to serve their
desired and intended purpose(s) and to properly function; and to allow
sufficient capacity on the tower pole to place personal wireless facilities and
related antennas owned or operated by the Village on the pole. The maximum
height that a tower and its attached antennas may be increased to under a
special use permit process is 150 feet. An applicant for a tower over 100 feet
in height must reserve space on the tower above 100 feet and allow the Village,
at its costs, to install, operate and maintain its antennas and related
equipment for municipal purposes and public health, welfare and safety purposes
during the time the tower is operational.
(Ord. CO-2010-006, passed 4-15-2010)
§ 120.05 GENERAL LOCATION, SITING CRITERIA AND PREFERENCES.
   The locations for siting communication facilities are listed in the
subsections below.
   (A)   No communication facility shall be constructed in or at a location
readily visible from a public trail, public park, forest preserve or other
outdoor recreation area, or in property designated as a floodway, unless it
blends with the surrounding existing natural and man-made environment in such a
manner as to be effectively unnoticeable (e.g. alternative tower structure) and
a certified engineer finds that no other location is technically feasible.
   (B)   No communication facility shall be installed at a location where
special painting or lighting will be required by the FAA regulations unless
technical evidence acceptable to the Director of Community Development and/or
Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals is submitted showing that this is the
only technically feasible location for this facility.
   (C)   No communication facility that is readily visible from off-site shall
be installed closer than one-half mile from another readily visible
uncamouflaged or unscreened communication facility, regardless of the Village
boundaries, unless it is a co-located facility, situated on a multiple-user
site, or blends with the surrounding existing natural and built environment in
such a manner as to be effectively unnoticeable; or technical evidence
acceptable to the Director of Community Development and/or Plan Commission/
Zoning Board of Appeals, is submitted demonstrating a clear need for this
facility and the unfeasibility of co-locating it on 1 of these former sites.
   (D)   Preferred location sites. Publicly used structures are preferred
locations throughout the Village because they appear in all neighborhoods and,
within each neighborhood, they appear to be institutional/infrastructure uses,
similar in appearance to communication facility installations. Therefore
communication facility installations on publicly used structures appear less
noticeable than on commercial or residential structures. Similarly, the
communication facilities on structures which already feature similar
installations (co-locations) would also appear less noticeable than on other
structures, up to the point when there would be too many antennae and the
structure appears too "busy," "cluttered," visually obtrusive and irritating.
      (1)   Publicly-used structures. Public facilities such as police or fire
stations, libraries, community centers, utility structures, water towers,
elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, smokestacks, telephone switching
facilities, or other public structures. Where the installation complies with
all FCC regulations and standards, schools, hospitals, health centers, legally
designated places of worship, or other similar institutional structures should
also be considered.
      (2)   Co-location site. Any existing site on which a legal wireless
communications facility is currently located shall be a preferred location site
regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however,
that locations which meet this criterion shall be subject to the design and
siting components of this chapter, applicable to the Comprehensive Plan, or
other such policies that may be adopted by the Plan Commission/Zoning Board of
Appeals, including, but not limited to, policies which prevent location of so
many facilities on a structure such that the roof or site resembles an "antenna
farm" or is otherwise deemed visually obtrusive.
      (3)   Manufacturing or commercial structures. Wholly industrial or
commercial structures within a manufacturing district, such as, factories,
retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, service stations where existing
visual obstructions/clutter on the roof or along the roofline can and will, in
a commercially practicable manner, be removed or camouflaged as part of the
installation.
      (4)   Billboards. The placement of only low profile antennas on existing
or new billboard structures is permitted, provided: the maximum height
regulations for antennas set forth in this chapter are complied with or a
special use permit is granted to increase the maximum height; and the antennas
shall be attached to the billboard monopole or installed behind the billboard
sign structure so that they are screened from public view to the extent
reasonably possible. In all cases, the maximum height of an antenna cannot
exceed the highest portion of the billboard sign or tower and the placement of
the antenna must be approved by a special use permit. Low profile antennas
installed on existing or new billboard structures or its related monopole are
not subject to the setback regulations set forth in this section. The color of
the antenna shall match the color of the monopole or billboard sign structure
to minimize its visibility.
   (E)   Limited preference sites. Antennas placed on buildings located in
business districts are limited preference sites. Antennas placed on multi-
family dwellings of 8 or more units are limited preference sites. The Director
of Community Development and/or the Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals
will not approve applications for such sites unless the application describes
the following:
      (1)   Demonstrates where any publicly-used buildings, co-location site or
other preferred location sites are located within the geographic service area;
      (2)   Demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence what good-faith
efforts and measures were taken to secure these preferred location sites;
      (3)   Explains why such efforts were unsuccessful; and
      (4)   Demonstrates that the location for the site is essential to meet
the demands in the geographic service area and the applicant's network.
      (5)   The Village may require an independent verification of this
analysis at the applicant's expense.
   (F)   Disfavored sites, residential districts. The Director of Community
Development and/or the Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals will not approve
applications for residential districts unless the application describes the
following:
      (1)   Demonstrates where any publicly-used buildings, co-location site or
other preferred location sites are located within the geographic service area;
      (2)   Demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence what good-faith
efforts and measures were taken to secure these preferred location sites;
      (3)   Explains why such efforts were unsuccessful; and
      (4)   Demonstrates that the location for the site is essential to meet
the demands in the geographic service area and the applicant's network.
      (5)   The Village may require an independent verification of this
analysis at the applicant's expense.
   (G)   Facilities placed on publicly used structures, as defined in division
(D)(1) of this section, shall not be considered disfavored sites and may be
approved as provided by this chapter.
   (H)   A co-location site as defined in division (D)(2) of this section shall
not be considered a disfavored site and may be approved as provided by this
chapter.
(Ord. CO-2010-006, passed 4-15-2010)
§ 120.06 CO-LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.
   Applicants shall certify, as documented by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer, that the commercial wireless communication service
equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be accommodated on an existing
or approved tower or building within a 1 mile search radius (one-half mile
search radius for towers under 120 feet in height, one-quarter mile search
radius for towers under 80 feet in height) of the proposed tower due to 1 or
more of the following reasons:
   (A)   The proposed antenna and/or equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of the existing or approved tower or building, and the existing or
approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate
planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
   (B)   The proposed antenna and/or equipment would cause interference
materially impacting the usability of other existing or planned equipment at
the tower or building and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
   (C)   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius
cannot accommodate the proposed antenna and/or equipment at a height necessary
to function reasonably.
   (D)   Other unforeseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
proposed antenna and/or equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
building.
   (E)   The Village may require independent verification of this analysis at
the applicant's expense.
(Ord. CO-2010-006, passed 4-15-2010)
§ 120.07 CO-LOCATION DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   Any proposed wireless communication facility shall be designed,
structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate both the
applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least 2 additional users if
the tower is over 100 feet in height (plus Village antennas and related
equipment, as specified in division (E) of this section) or for at least 1
additional user if the tower is over 60 feet in height. Towers must be designed
to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept
antennas mounted at varying heights.
   (A)   The facility shall make available unutilized space for co-location of
other communication facilities, including space for these entities providing
similar, competing services.
   (B)   A good faith effort in achieving co-location shall be required of the
host entity.
      (1)   Requests for utilization of facility space and responses to such
requests shall be made in a timely manner, in writing, and copies shall be
provided to the Village's business license files.
      (2)   The Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals shall mediate any
unresolved disputes pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Zoning Ordinance of the
Village of Maywood.
   (C)   The applicant shall provide a notarized letter of intent committing
the tower owner and successors to allow the shared use of the tower if an
additional user agrees in writing to meet reasonable terms and conditions for
shared use.
   (D)   The applicant shall also provide a report from a licensed professional
engineer that demonstrates the tower's compliance with co-location structural
and electrical standards.
   (E)   An applicant for a tower over 100 feet in height must reserve space on
the tower above 100 feet and allow the Village, at its cost, to install,
operate and maintain its antennas and equipment for municipal purposes and
public health, welfare and safety purposes during the time the tower is
operational. This reservation of space is exclusive of the space that must be
reserved for an additional 2 users as required in this division.
(Ord. CO-2010-006, passed 4-15-2010)
§ 120.08 AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE EXISTING TOWERS, OTHER STRUCTURES, OR
ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY.
   No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna.
An applicant shall submit information requested by the Director of Community
Development and/or Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals related to the
availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative
technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure
or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may
consist of any of the following:
   (A)   No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area, which meet applicant's engineering requirements.
   (B)   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
applicant's engineering requirements.
   (C)   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
   (D)   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
   (E)   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
   (F)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that
render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
   (G)   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network
using multiple low-powered transmitters/ receivers attached to a wireline
system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or
antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
(Ord. CO-2010-006, passed 4-15-2010)
§ 120.09 AESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS.
   Towers and antennas shall meet the following aesthetic and design
requirements:
   (A)   Towers shall be of a monopole design.
   (B)   Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment,
except in instances where the color is indicated by federal or state
authorities such as the FAA.
   (C)   All poles, towers, antenna supports, antennas, and other components of
each site, other than the integral design of an alternative tower structure,
shall be initially painted and thereafter repainted as necessary with a "flat"
paint. The color selected shall be one that in the opinion of the Director of
Community Development and/or Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals, as
appropriate, will minimize their visibility to the greatest extent feasible. To
this end, improvements which will be primarily viewed against soils, trees or
grasslands shall be painted colors matching these landscapes while elements
which rise above the horizon shall be painted a blue-gray that matches the
typical sky color at that location.
   (D)   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
   (E)   The Village shall have the authority to require special design of the
communication facilities where findings of particular sensitivity are made
(e.g. proximity to residential, historic or aesthetically significant
structures, views and/or community features).
(Ord. CO-2010-006, passed 4-15-2010)
§ 120.10 LANDSCAPING.
   All communication facilities shall be installed in such a manner so as to
maintain and enhance existing native vegetation and to install suitable
landscaping to screen the facility, where necessary. The following requirements
shall be implemented for all communication facilities, except those
communication facilities that are exempt as defined in §
120.02. Where an antenna is installed on an existing building or where an
antenna is added to an existing tower as provided by this chapter, the Director
of Community Development and/or Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals may
reduce landscaping requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better
served thereby.
   (A)   A landscape plan shall be submitted with the project application
indicating all existing vegetation, identifying landscaping that is to be
retained on the site and any additional vegetation that is needed to
satisfactorily screen the facility from adjacent land uses and public view
areas. The landscape plan shall be subject to review and approval of the
administrative or special use review process. All trees larger than 4 inches in
diameter shall be identified in the landscape plan with indication of species
type, diameter at 4-1/2 feet high, and whether it is to be retained or removed
with project development.
   (B)   Existing trees and other screening vegetation in the vicinity of the
facility and along the access roads and power/telecommunication line routes
involved shall be protected from damage, both during the construction period
and thereafter. Therefore, the following measures shall be implemented:
      (1)   A tree protection plan shall be submitted with the building permit
or improvement plan. This plan shall be prepared by a certified arborist and
give specific measures to protect trees during project construction;
      (2)   Grading, cutting/filling, and the storage/parking of equipment/
vehicles shall be prohibited in the protected landscaped areas and the drip
line of any trees required to be preserved. Such areas shall be fenced to the
satisfaction of the Director of Community Development, as appropriate. Trash,
debris, or spoils shall not be placed within these fences nor shall the fences
henceforth be opened or moved until the project is complete and written
approval to remove the fencing has been received from the Director of Community
Development; and
      (3)   All underground lines shall be routed such that a minimum amount of
damage is done to tree root systems.
   (C)   All areas disturbed during project construction, other than required
access road and parking areas required under §
120.12, shall be replanted with vegetation compatible with the vegetation in
the surrounding area (e.g. ornamental shrubs or natural brush depending upon
the circumstances) to the satisfaction of the Director of Community Development
and/or Plan Commission/ Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (D)   Any existing trees or significant vegetation, on the facilities site
or along the affected access area that die shall be replaced with native trees
and vegetation of a size and species acceptable to the Director of Community
Development and/or Plan Commission/Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (E)   No action shall be taken after project completion with respect to the
vegetation and landscaping that would increase the visibility of the facility
or the access road and power/ telecommunication lines serving it.
   (F)   Existing mature tree growth, vegetation and natural landforms on the
site shall be preserved to the absolute maximum extent possible. In some cases,
such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be sufficient buffer.
   (G)   All communication facilities shall be screened from view by an
evergreen hedge with an ultimate height of 8 feet and a planted height of at

is significantly higher than that for other similarly sized geographic areas of
the Village that are not located within a prostitution-free zone or areas where
observations by police officers and Village officials or citizen complaints
lead the Village President and Board of Trustees to conclude that prostitution
or related offenses are taking place in such areas with significant more
frequency than other similarly sized geographic areas of the Village that are
not located within a prostitution-free zone.
(Ord. C0-05-09, passed 3-7-2005; Am. Ord. C0-09-07, passed 3-3-2009)

exclusion and variances substantially similar to Exhibit A attached to
Ordinance No. C0-05-09, a copy of which is on file in the Village Clerk's

the process described in § 131.10.
   (C)   The notice of exclusion shall be in writing and a copy delivered to
the excluded person. The notice of exclusion shall specify the following:
      (1)   The area designated as a prostitution-free zone under this chapter,
along with a written boundary description and map indicating the area from
which that person is excluded; and
      (2)   Information concerning the right to appeal the exclusion to the

   (D)   A 90-day notice of exclusion shall automatically convert to a 1-year

(Ord. C0-05-09, passed 3-7-2005)
§ 131.09 APPEALS.
   A person to whom a notice of exclusion is issued shall have a right to

issuance of the notice of exclusion.
   (D)   An appeal of a 1-year guilt-based exclusion must be filed, in writing,
with the Village Manager by 5:00 p.m. of the fifth business day following the
date of entry of the finding or plea.
   (E)   An appeal of:
      (1)   A denial of a request for a variance subsequent to the initial
notice of exclusion; or
      (2)   A denial of a request for an amendment to a variance; or
      (3)   A revocation of a variance, must be filed, in writing, by 5:00 p.m.
of the fifth business day following the action regarding the variance.
   (F)   A 90-day exclusion shall not take effect during the time that an
appeal of the 90-day exclusion is pending. If no appeal is taken, the initial
90-day exclusion shall take effect at 12:01 a.m. on the eighth calendar day
following the issuance of the notice of exclusion.
   (G)   A 1-year guilt-based exclusion shall take effect at 12:01 a.m. on the
calendar day following the date of the finding or plea and, notwithstanding an
appeal of the exclusion, shall remain in effect unless the Village Manager
issues a contrary decision.
   (H)   At the hearing on an appeal of a 90-day exclusion, the Village shall
have the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant
committed any of the offenses enumerated in § 131.06(A), and that the conduct
supporting the exclusion occurred within a prostitution-free zone.
   (I)   At the hearing on an appeal of a 1-year guilt-based exclusion, the
Village shall have the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that
the appellant was found guilty or entered a plea of guilty for any of the
offenses enumerated in § 131.06(A), and that the conduct supporting the finding
or plea occurred within a prostitution-free zone. The entry of an order of
supervision upon a finding of guilt or plea of guilty shall have no adverse
impact on the validity of the exclusion.
   (J)   At the hearing on an appeal of a denial of a request for a variance or
denial of a request for an amendment to a variance as provided in divisions (E)
(1) and (E)(2) of this section, the Village shall have the burden to show by a
preponderance of the evidence that the denial was in accordance with this
section.
   (K)   At the hearing on an appeal of a revocation of a variance as provided
in division (E)(3) of this section, the Village shall have the burden to show
by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the conditions enumerated in §
131.10(B) supporting revocation existed at the time of revocation.
   (L)   At the hearing on an appeal of a 90-day exclusion, the following shall
be prima facie evidence that the exclusion was based on probable cause to
believe that the appellant committed any of the offenses enumerated in § 131.06
(A):
      (1)   A determination by a court having jurisdiction over the offense
that forms the basis for the exclusion, that probable cause existed to arrest
the person to whom the initial 90-day notice of exclusion was issued for
violation of any of the offenses enumerated in § 131.06(A); or
      (2)   An accusatory instrument charging the person to whom a 90-day
notice of exclusion was issued, for violation of any of the offenses enumerated
in § 131.06(A).
   (M)   At the hearing on an appeal of a 1-year guilt-based exclusion, a
judgment indicating a finding of guilt or a plea of guilty for any of the
offenses that formed the basis for the exclusion, as enumerated in § 131.06(A),
shall be conclusive evidence that the described conduct occurred. The entry of
an order of supervision upon a finding of guilt or plea of guilty shall have no
adverse impact on the validity of the exclusion.
(Ord. C0-05-09, passed 3-7-2005)
§ 131.10 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances shall be granted, denied, amended, or revoked in accordance
with the following provisions:
      (1)   All variances shall be in writing, for a specific period and only
to accommodate a specific purpose, all of which shall be stated on the
variance.
      (2)   The purpose of the variance is to allow only travel to and from
locations within a prostitution-free zone according to the terms of the
variance. The variance must be carried on the person while in a prostitution-
free zone in order to be effective and must be presented to a police officer
upon request.
      (3)   The Police Department shall receive and process requests for
prostitution-free zone variances during regular business hours if they are
otherwise open to the public. This capability will be maintained at the police
station.
      (4)   The Police Department, prior to issuing a variance, may demand
proof in the form of written documentation concerning the need for a variations
in cases where such documentation would be appropriate, including but not
limited to, written proof of residency or employment.
         (a)   General variance. The Chief of Police and/or his designees may,
for any reason, grant an excluded person a variance from an exclusion at any
time during an exclusion period. The Chief of Police and/or designees shall
grant an appropriate variance to an excluded person who presents a plausible
need to engage in any non-criminal activity that is not associated with the
behavior supporting the person's exclusion. A variance granted under this
division (A)(4)(a) allows travel within the prostitution-free zone only in
accordance with the terms specified in the variance.
         (b)   Residential variance. The Chief of Police and/or his designees
shall grant a residential variance to an excluded person. A residential
variance allows travel within the prostitution-free zone directly to or from
the person's residence other than transient occupancy in a hotel or motel in
accordance with the terms of the variance.
         (c)   Essential needs variance. The Chief of Police and/or his
designees shall grant an essential needs variance to an excluded person. An
essential needs variance allows travel within the prostitution-free zone in
accordance with the terms of the variance:
            1.   To access a public or private place within the prostitution-
free zone that provides an essential need; and
            2.   When the essential need sought by the excluded person cannot
be reasonably accessed by the excluded person without entering the
prostitution-free zone.
         (d)   Employment variance. The Chief of Police and/or his designees
shall grant an employment variance to an excluded person. An employment
variance allows an excluded person to travel to, from or for work within the
prostitution-free zone in accordance with the terms of the variance if the
excluded person:
            1.   Is an owner, principal, agent or employee of a place of lawful
employment located in the prostitution-free zone; or
            2.   Is required to perform employment-related services in the
prostitution-free zone.
         (e)   Social services variance. The Chief of Police and/or his
designees shall grant a social services variance to an excluded person. A
social services variance allows travel within the prostitution-free zone in
accordance with the terms of the variance if the excluded person:
            1.   Is in need of social services in the prostitution-free zone;
            2.   The social services are sought for reasons relating to the
health or well-being of the excluded person; and
            3.   The social services agency has written rules and regulations
prohibiting the unlawful use and sale of controlled substances by their
clients.
         (f)   Educational variance. The Chief of Police and/or his designees
shall grant an educational variance to an excluded person. An educational
variance allows travel within the prostitution-free zone in accordance with the
terms of the variance to enroll as a student or attend school at an educational
facility located within the prostitution-free zone.
   (B)   Revocation or amendment of variances. Variances may be revoked or
amended in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   A variance may be revoked or amended for the following reasons:
         (a)   The excluded person provided false information in order to
obtain the variance;
         (b)   There is probable cause to believe the person has committed any
of the offenses enumerated in § 131.06(A) in the prostitution-free zone
subsequent to the issuance of the variance;
         (c)   If the circumstances giving rise to the issuance of the variance
no longer support a continuation of the variance or a term thereof; or
         (d)   If the person has new circumstances that would support amending
the variance.
      (2)   Residential variance exception.
         (a)   A residential variance may be revoked only if the applicant
provided false residential information in order to obtain the variance; or
         (b)   If the circumstances giving rise to the issuance of the variance
no longer support a continuation of the variance.

be verified and approved by the Building Director, before a permit to move the
building or structure involved shall be issued or will be recognized as valid.
   (B)   No person shall move any building which has been damaged to an extent
greater than one-third of its value by fire, decay or otherwise, such value to

§ 150.006 PROCEDURE FOR VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   The procedure in all cases of unauthorized deviations from, or
violations of, the provisions of this chapter found on inspections required by
the preceding section shall be as follows: a verbal notice shall be immediately
served by the inspector at the site, and on the persons doing or in charge of
the work being done, or responsible for or capable of correcting, or of causing
to be corrected the deviation observed. Such verbal notice shall be followed by
a written notice on forms prepared for the purpose and designating the
deviation observed. Should the work or condition continue, notwithstanding such
verbal and written notice, then a copy of such notice shall be posted at the
site in as safe and conspicuous a place as practicable, and where, if
unmolested, the same must certainly come to the notice of any persons either
employed on the work, or frequenting or occupying the building, structure or
premises, and a duplicate of such written notice shall be mailed to the last
known address of the owner, agent or person in control of the building or
structure involved.
   (B)   If the verbal or written or posted notice or any of them are respected
and steps are promptly taken to correct the deviation observed, and if such
deviation is promptly corrected, on notice, to the satisfaction of the
inspector in charge and consistent with the requirements of this chapter, the
deviation observed shall not be deemed a willful violation of this chapter, nor
be subject to any penalty therein provided.
   (C)   In the event a written notice of a deviation from the provisions of
this chapter so observed has been posted and mailed, as aforesaid, and the work
or condition continues in defiance thereof, or if the deviation is not promptly
corrected in a manner consistent with the provisions of this chapter and the
urgency of the case, then the deviation shall be considered a willful
violation, and the inspector shall promptly stop the work, and if need be shall
close the building or structure to the public. The facts pertaining to the case
and the steps so far taken therein shall next and forthwith be reported in
writing on forms prepared for the purpose to the Building Director, who shall
forthwith proceed to enforce the provisions and penalties provided.
   (D)   The Building Director and other officers of the Village who may assist
him in case of flagrant or defiant violations of this chapter are authorized to
use the police power of the Village in such manner and to such extent as the
character of the violation and the urgency, hazards, rights and interests of
public health and safety may justify and demand for the case involved.

§ 150.007 STOPPAGE OF WORK; CANCELLATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   The Building Director is directed to stop work on any building,
structure or portion thereof that is being done in a reckless, unsafe or
insanitary manner, or with the use of defective or improper materials, and on
any building, structure or portion thereof proposed for unlawful purposes as
regards location, intended use or occupancy, and any work that in any other
respect is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or to the
requirements of any other ordinances of the Village.
   (B)   This right and duty shall exist and be performed irrespective of any
permit that may or may not have been either required or issued for the work
involved.
   (C)   The suspension of work shall be for such time as may be necessary to
secure a correction of the particular violations and features complained of or
until a satisfactory agreement and arrangement, approved of by the Building
Director, is reached that such correction will be made, and if a court trial is
had, then the work shall be suspended and held in abeyance until the court
renders its decision.
   (D)   Any person having charge of, directing, or in any way engaged in work
that violates this chapter, who shall refuse or fail to promptly desist from
such work on written notice from the Building Director, or who having desisted
on either verbal or written or posted notice shall resume the work before the
violation which occasioned the order is corrected or agreed to be corrected
satisfactorily to the Building Director and consistent with the purposes of
this chapter, or who before having been authorized by the Building Director,
resumes work stopped by the Building Director, shall be deemed guilty of
violating this chapter and permits for work being done in violation of this
chapter may be canceled or revoked on order of the Building Director.

§ 150.008 CONFLICTS BETWEEN PROVISIONS.
   When a general provision or requirement of this chapter or the zoning
regulations of the Village conflicts with a specific provision thereof relating
to the construction, equipment, maintenance, use or location of any building,
structure, or any portion thereof in this chapter or the zoning regulations,
the specific provision or requirement shall govern.

§ 150.009 DECISIONS OF DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINAL.
   Whenever the decision of the Building Director upon the safety of any
building or any part thereof is made in a case which is so urgent that failure
properly to carry out their orders to demolish or strengthen such building or
part thereof may in their judgment endanger life and limb, the decision and
order of the Building Director shall be absolute and final.
(1997 Code, § 23.09) (Ord. CO-08-95, passed 10-12-1995; Am. Ord. CO-09-27,

§ 150.010 ENFORCEMENT.
   The duty of enforcing this chapter shall primarily devolve upon the Building
Director and their assistants. The Chief of Police, the Chief of the Fire
Department, the Corporation Counsel and the Health Commissioner are authorized
and directed to aid in enforcing this chapter. The Chief of Police and the
Corporation Counsel, insofar as may be necessary and practicable, shall each
act in conjunction with and through the Building Director and their assistants.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as disqualifying or exempting any
other department head or officer of the Village from the duty of aiding in the
enforcement of any provisions of this chapter.
(1997 Code, § 23.10) (Ord. CO-08-95, passed 10-12-1995; Am. Ord. CO-09-27,
passed 10-6- 2009; Am. Ord. CO-2021-21, passed 8-17-2021)
§ 150.011 PERMITS.
   (A)   Required. Before proceeding with the erection, enlargement,
alteration, repair or removal of any building or structured in the Village, a
permit for such erection, enlargement, alteration, repair or removal shall
first be obtained by the owner or their agent from the Building Director, and
it shall be unlawful to proceed with the erection, enlargement, alteration,
repair or removal of any building or of any structural part thereof within the
Village unless such permit shall first have been obtained from the Building
Director.
   (B)   Time limit extension fee. If after a permit has been granted, the
operations called for by the permit shall not be begun within 90 days after the
date thereof, or if such operations are not completed within 1 year from the
date thereof, such permit shall be void, and no operations thereunder shall be
begun or completed until an extended permit shall be taken out by the owner or
their agent. A fee of 20% of the original cost of permit shall be charged for
such extended permit.
   (C)   Ordinary repairs.
      (1)   A permit is not required for the exempted items listed under §
150.002(K).
      (2)   Before such repairs shall be made notification thereof by the
contractor shall be filed with the Building Director if the cost of such work
exceeds $1,000.
   (D)   Application; issuance of permit. Applications for a building permit
shall be made by the owner or their agent to the Building Director. When such
application is made, plans in conformity with the provisions of this chapter,
the Village’s Fire Prevention Code and all other applicable provisions of this
Code or any other ordinance, rule or regulation of the Village shall be filed
with the Building Director. Where the permit seeks to erect, enlarge, alter,
repair, or remove any building or structure in the Village that has been found
to be abandoned for 90 days or more, or is proposed to be improved, upgraded,
demolished, or rehabbed at a value of 50% or more of the building’s assessed
value, or where the habitable space is being increased (additional bedrooms,
sleeping rooms, or bathrooms), and/or changes interior water or sewer supply
lines (except those in the course of ordinary repairs), or where plumbing is
being substantially upgraded, the applicant shall be required to ensure all
water service piping, which includes all piping from the water meter location
to the terminating fixture, shall be piped from the street main to the water
distribution system for the building, the plans must include improvements or
upgrades to any sewer and/or water connections and piping systems to ensure
compliance with the land and water pollution requirements of the Illinois
Environmental Property Agency, Division of Water Pollution Control and the
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, other applicable state, federal,
county or other laws or regulatory requirements relating to sewer and/or water
lines and service, and any other applicable ordinance set forth in this Code.
Unless the application pertains to a building used exclusively for residential
purposes which contains not more than 2 dwelling units, the Building Director
shall refer the plans for review to the Bureau of Fire Prevention. The Bureau
of Fire Prevention shall review the plans for the purpose of determining
whether the plans are in conformity with the Village’s Fire Prevention Code.
The Bureau of Fire Prevention shall thereafter notify the Building Director
whether the plans are or are not in conformity with the Village’s Fire
Prevention Code. If the plans are determined to be in conformity with the
Village’s Fire Prevention Code, or if review of the plans by the Bureau of Fire
Prevention is not required under the provisions of this section, the Building
and Code Enforcement Department shall review the plans to determine whether
they are in conformity with all other applicable codes, ordinances, rules and
regulations. If the plans are in conformity with the Village’s Building Code,
Fire Prevention Code, if applicable, and all other applicable codes,
ordinances, rules and regulations, then the Building Director shall issue a
building permit and shall apply to such plans a final official stamp, stating
that the drawings to which the stamp has been applied comply with the terms of
this chapter, the Village’s Fire Prevention Code, if applicable, and to all
other applicable codes, ordinances, rules and regulations. The plans so stamped
shall then be returned to the applicant, along with a copy of the building
permit. True copies of so much of the plans as may be required in the opinion
of the Building Director and the Village’s Fire Prevention Officer to
illustrate the features of construction and equipment of the building referred
to shall be filed with the Building Director and shall remain on file in their
office for a period of 6 months after the occupation of the building or
structure for which the permit was issued. After the 6 month period expires,
the drawings shall be returned to the person who provided the drawings to the
Building Director upon request. It shall not be obligatory upon the Building
Director to retain such drawings in their custody for more than 6 months after
the occupation of the building or structure for which the permit was issued.

§ 150.012 PLANS.
   (A)   Required. The Building Director shall not issue any building permit
unless the plans submitted for their approval clearly show that such building
or structure with all its appurtenances, foundations and attachments can be
erected entirely within the limits of the lot or tract of land upon which it is
proposed to erect such building or structure except as provided by this chapter
or other ordinances of the Village, and no permit shall authorize the use of
any part of any public highway or other public ground for the construction or
maintenance of such building or structure except as provided by this chapter or
other ordinances of the Village.
   (B)   Plans on job site. In all cases, the approved plan, together with
building permits, must be kept on the job while the work is in progress.
   (C)   Contents. All such plans and drawings shall be drawn to a scale of not
less than one-eighth of an inch to the foot, on paper or cloth, in ink, or by
some process that will not fade or obliterate, to be accompanied by electronic
document of the same in PDF or other approved file type. A Plat of Survey is
required showing all distances and dimensions accurately figured, and drawings
made explicitly and complete, showing the lot lines and the location of the
exterior lines of the building in relation thereto, and the entire ventilating,
sewerage and drain pipes and the location of all plumbing fixtures within such
building. Each set of plans presented shall be approved by the Code Official or
designee before a permit will be granted. No permit shall be granted or plans
approved unless such plans are made and signed by such persons as are permitted
under the laws of the state to make plans for buildings, as provided in 225
ILCS 305/1 et seq.
   (D)   Driveways.
      (1)   No building permit shall be granted for a single-family residence
or a two-family residence unless the plans submitted clearly show that a strip
of land not less than 10 feet in width has been provided for driveway purposes
on the lot on which such building is to be constructed. Said 10 feet may
include that portion of the lot designated as a “sideyard” under the terms of
the zoning ordinance. Any deviation in construction from the plans submitted
for such building which results in the reduction in size of such strip shall be
unlawful and shall operate to annul the permit which has been issued for such
work.
      (2)   The foregoing driveway requirement shall not apply to a lot having
an alley to the rear thereof, to a corner lot, or to any lot lying between 2
lots on which buildings have been constructed if such lot is exempt from the
minimum area requirements of the zoning ordinance by reason of being of record
at the time of the passage of the zoning ordinance.
   (E)   Architect or engineer to certify plans. It shall be unlawful for any
architect or structural engineer or other person permitted under the laws of
the state to make drawings and plans, to prepare or submit to the Building
Director for their approval, any final drawings or plans for any building or
structure which does not comply with the requirements contained in this
chapter. It shall be the duty of the Building Director to require that all
drawings and plans submitted to them for approval for any building or structure
be accompanied by a certificate of such architect or structural engineer
preparing such drawings and plans, and that such drawings and plans must have
the architect’s or structural engineer’s licensed seal stamped on drawings
submitted as provided by 225 ILCS 305/1 et seq.
   (F)   Alterations and deviations from plans. It shall be unlawful to erase,
alter or modify any lines, figures or coloring contained upon such drawings so
stamped by the Building Director or filed with them for reference. If during
the progress of the execution of such work it is desired to deviate in any
manner affecting the construction or other essentials of the building from the
terms of the application or drawing, notice of such intention to alter or
deviate shall be given to the Building Director, and their written assent shall
first be obtained before such alteration or deviation may be made. Alterations
in buildings which do not require a permit and that are not in violation of any
of the provisions of this chapter, or the requirements of the zoning ordinance,
may be made without the permission of the Building Director.

   For the purpose of facilitating the commencement of lawful building
operations, the Building Director may authorize such operations to commence and
proceed for such limited time, not exceeding 20 days as the Building Director
may deem sufficient to allow the owner, their architect or agent to complete
the filing of detailed plans and other data required for the issuance of the
final permit. Temporary permits will be revocable at the will of the Building
Director. In case new buildings or structures are to be erected, the work shall
not be carried above the level of the grade line, nor above the level of the
first tier of girders, beams, floor joists or first floor proper. The applicant
for a temporary permit shall furnish the Building Director to determine that
the work to be commenced and proposed subsequently to be done is of a lawful
nature and shall file with the Building Director the frontage consents required
by this chapter or other laws of the Village for the proposed work or purpose.

from the applicant that payment has been made to the Water Department of the
Village for the water to be used or for a water meter for measuring all the
water to be used in the construction of such building under the provisions of
this Code relative to water regulations. Such applicant shall produce evidence
that they have complied with all the requirements of this Code and of the
Village ordinance as to use of the streets and alleys of the Village by reason
of any proposed obstruction or occupation thereof in and about such building
operations.

be unlawful to proceed with the wrecking or tearing down of any such building
or structure or any structural part of such building or structure unless each
permit shall first have been obtained. Application for such permit shall be
made by such owner or their agent to the Building Director, who shall issue
such permit upon such application and the payment of the fees provided for in §
150.004. Upon the issuance of such permit, such building may be wrecked or torn
down, provided that all the work done thereunder shall be subject to the
supervision of the Building Director and to such reasonable restrictions as
they may impose in regard to elements of safety and health, and provided
further that the work shall be kept sprinkled and sufficient scaffolding be
provided to ensure safety to human life.
   (B)   Before any permit is issued granting authority to wreck or demolish a
building or structure for which such permit is required, the person engaged in
the work of wrecking or demolishing same shall file with the Director of
Finance a bond which has a principal amount of not less than $50,000 with

liability of any kind which the Village may incur, or which may accrue against,
be charged to or be recovered from the Village, or any of its officials, from
or by reason or on account of injuries or damage to persons or property during
any such wrecking or demolition operations from or by reason or on account of
failure to comply with divisions (C) or (D) hereof, or by reason or on account
of anything done under or by virtue of any permit granted for any such wrecking
or demolition operations. Such bond in each case shall extend over the period
of and cover all such wrecking or demolition operations.
   (C)   Any deposit of mud on any street, sidewalk or alley as a result of
wrecking or demolition operations shall be completely removed on the day that
the mud is deposited. The obligations of this division (C) rest jointly and
separately on any owner performing wrecking or demolition operations or on
whose behalf wrecking or demolition operations are performed, and upon any
contractor performing wrecking or demolition operations.
   (D)   Within 30 days following completion of the wrecking or demolition of
any building or structure:
      (1)   All debris from the demolished structure or building must be
removed from the parcel of land on which the building or structure was located
and the parcel must be seeded or sodded; and
      (2)   Existing pavements and surfaces within the public right-of-way
which were damaged or otherwise disturbed as a result of wrecking or demolition
operations shall be restored to their original condition. The obligations of
this division (D) rest jointly and separately upon any owner performing
wrecking or demolition operations or on whose behalf wrecking or demolition
operations are performed and upon any contractor performing wrecking or
demolition operations.
   (E)   Any person violating the terms and conditions of this section shall be
subject to a penalty of not to exceed $500, with each and every day that the
violation is allowed to remain in effect being deemed a complete and separate
offense. In addition, the appropriate authorities of the Village may take such
other action as they deem proper to enforce the terms and conditions of this
section, including, without limitation, an action in equity to compel
compliance with its terms. Any person violating the terms of this section shall
be subject, in addition to the foregoing penalties, to the payment of court

Building Director to revoke the permit for the building or wrecking operations
in connection with which such violation shall have taken place. It shall be

requirements of this chapter as to buildings of the class in which such
building is, or to make any changes in plans or construction affecting means of
egress, ventilation, natural lighting or sanitary conditions without first
obtaining the written consent of the Building Director to such changes. Any
such departure or any such change without the consent of the Building Director
being obtained, as required herein, shall operate to annul the permit which has
been issued.
   (B)   Stop work orders. In case any work is done under a permit authorizing
the erection, alteration or repair of a building or structure, which work is
contrary to the approved plans, the Building Director and their assistants

therein to stop and desist therefrom. Such work shall not be resumed until
satisfactory assurance has been given the Building Director that it will be
done according to the approved plans or until the Building Director has

which cases a new permit must be issued before the work proceeds, for which
permit the usual fee shall be paid by the contractor doing such work.
   (C)   Lack of permit. No contractor or builder shall begin any work on any
building or structure for which a permit is required until such permit shall
have been secured. In case any work is begun on the erection, alteration,

Director and their assistants shall have power to at once stop such work and to
order any and all persons engaged therein to stop and desist therefrom until
the proper permit is secured.

on a form to be furnished by the Village a bond in the penal sum of $15,000,
with surety to be approved by the Village Manager and conditioned to indemnify,
save and keep harmless the Village from any and all loss, costs, expense or
liability which the Village may suffer or be put to, or, which may be recovered
from it by reason of the issuance of such permit, or by reason of any act or
thing done, or neglected to be done under or by virtue of the authority given
in such permit. An annual bond may be given to cover street occupancy permits.
   (D)   Permit fee and deposit. The fee and deposit for a street occupancy
permit shall be as set forth in §

action against the person to recover the damage done to any street or sidewalk.
   (E)   Limitations on occupancy of streets. The permission to occupy space of
any street or in alleys for the purposes of building is intended only for
imperative use in connection with the actual erection, repair, alteration,
wrecking or removal of buildings and shall terminate with the completion of
such operation. It shall also be unlawful to occupy any such named space under
authority of the street occupancy permit for the storage of articles not
intended for immediate use in connection with the operation for which such
permit has been issued. Failure to immediately remove building or other
material from such occupied space on notice so to do from the Building Director

of any street or alleys other than immediately in front of the lot or land upon
which the building is being erected; provided, that if the written consent of
the owners, tenants or occupants of properties adjoining the site of any
proposed building is first obtained and filed with the Building Director, the

§ 150.030 RESERVED.
§ 150.031 REGISTRATION OF FORECLOSING MORTGAGED PROPERTY AND VACANT PROPERTY.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose and intent of the Board of
Trustees to establish a process to address the deterioration, crime, and
decline in value of Village neighborhoods caused by property with foreclosing
or foreclosed mortgages located within the Village, and to identify, regulate,
limit and reduce the number of these properties located within the Village. It
has been determined that owner-occupied structures are generally better
maintained when compared to vacant structures, even with a diligent off-site
property owner. Vacant structures or structures owned by individuals who are
economically strained and unable to meet their mortgage obligations are often
not properly or diligently maintained, which contributes to blight, declined
property values, and have a negative impact on social perception of the
residential areas where they are located. It is the Board of Trustees' further
intent to establish a registration program as a mechanism to help protect
neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance
of properties that are in foreclosure or foreclosed, and to provide a mechanism
to avert foreclosure actions through timely intervention, education or
counseling of property owners.
   (B)   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where
the context clearly indicates a different meaning.
      DEFAULT. Shall mean that the mortgagor has not complied with the terms of
the mortgage on the property, or the promissory note, or other evidence of the
debt, referred to in the mortgage.
      ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. Any Law Enforcement Officer, Building Director or
other Building Official, Zoning Inspector, Code Enforcement Officer, Fire
Inspector, Building Inspector, or other person authorized by the Village to
enforce the applicable code(s).
      EVIDENCE OF VACANCY. Any condition that, on its own, or combined with
other conditions present, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the
property is vacant. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to:
overgrown and/or dead vegetation; past due utility notices and/or disconnected
utilities; accumulation of trash, junk or debris; abandoned vehicles, auto
parts and/or materials; the absence of furnishings and/or personal items
consistent with habitation or occupancy; the presence of an unsanitary,
stagnant swimming pool; the accumulation of newspapers, circulars, fivers and/
or mail; statements by neighbors, passers-by, delivery agents or government
agents; and/or the presence of boards over doors, windows or other openings in
violation of applicable code.
      FORECLOSURE or FORECLOSURE ACTION. The legal process by which a
mortgagee, or other lien holder, terminates or attempts to terminate a property
owner's equitable right of redemption to obtain legal and equitable title to
the real property pledged as security for a debt or the real property subject
to the lien. The legal process is not concluded until the property obtained by
the mortgagee, lien holder, or their designee, by certificate of title, or any
other means, is sold to a non-related bona fide purchaser in an arm's length
transaction to satisfy the debt or lien.
      MORTGAGEE. The creditor, including but not limited to: trustees; mortgage
servicing companies; lenders in a mortgage agreement: any agent, servant or
employee of the creditor; any successor in interest; or any assignee of the
creditor's rights, interests or obligations under the mortgage agreement; or
any other person or entity with the legal right to foreclose on the real
property, excluding governmental entities as the assignee or owner.
      OWNER. Every person, entity or mortgagee, who, alone or severally with
others, has legal or equitable title to any real property as defined by this
chapter; has legal care, charge or control of any such property: is in
possession or control of any such property; and/or is vested with possession or
control of any such property. The property manager shall not be considered the
owner.
      PROPERTY MANAGER. Any party designated by the owner as responsible for
inspecting, maintaining and securing the property as required in this chapter.
      REAL PROPERTY. Any residential or commercial land and/or buildings,
leasehold improvements and anything affixed to the land, or portion thereof
identified by a property parcel identification number, located in the Village
limits.
      REGISTRABLE PROPERTY. Shall mean:
         (a)   Any real property located in the Village, whether vacant or
occupied, that is encumbered by a mortgage subject to an ongoing foreclosure
action by the mortgagee or trustee, has been the subject of a foreclosure
action by a mortgagee or trustee and a judgment has been entered, or has been
the subject of a foreclosure sale where the title was transferred to the
beneficiary of a mortgage involved in the foreclosure and any properties
transferred under a deed in lieu of foreclosure/sale. The designation of a
"foreclosure" property as "registrable" shall remain in place until such time
as the property is sold to a non-related bona fide purchaser in an arm's length
transaction or the foreclosure action has been dismissed; or
         (b)   Any property that is vacant for more than 30 days or any
cancellation of utility or service, whichever occurs first.

a building to be habitable and/or perform a service necessary to comply with
all Village codes. This includes, but is not limited to, electrical, gas,
water, sewer, lawn maintenance, pool maintenance and snow removal.
      VACANT. Any parcel of land in the Village that contains any building or
structure that is not lawfully occupied.
   (C)   Applicability and jurisdiction. This chapter applies to foreclosing,
foreclosed and vacant property within the Village.

section, the Village, or its designee, shall establish a registry cataloging
each registrable property within the Village, containing the information
required by this section.
   (E)   Inspection and registration of real property under foreclosure.
      (1)   Any mortgagee who holds a mortgage on real property located within
the Village shall perform an inspection of the property upon default by the
mortgagor as evidenced by the filing of a foreclosure action.
      (2)   Property inspected pursuant to division (E)(1) above that remains
in foreclosure shall be inspected every 30 days by the mortgagee or mortgagee's
designee. If an inspection shows a change in the property's occupancy status,
the mortgagee shall, within 10 days of that inspection, update the occupancy
status of the property registration.
      (3)   Within 10 days of the date any mortgagee files a foreclosure
action, the mortgagee shall register the real property with the Village
registry, and, at the time of registration, indicate whether the property is
vacant, and if so shall designate in writing a property manager to inspect,
maintain and secure the real property subject to the mortgage under a
foreclosure action when legally possible. A separate registration is required
for each property under a foreclosure action, regardless of whether it is
occupied or vacant.
      (4)   Initial registration pursuant to this section shall contain at a

address, telephone number and name of the property manager, and said person's
address, email address and telephone number.

non-refundable semi-annual registration fee of $325 for each property.
Subsequent non-refundable semi-annual renewal registrations of properties and
fees in the amount of $325 are due within 10 days of the expiration of the
previous registration. Said fees shall be used to offset the costs of: (1)
registration and registration enforcement; (2) code enforcement and mitigation
related to defaulted properties; (3) post-closing counseling and foreclosure
intervention limited to owner-occupied persons in default, which may not
include cash and mortgage modification assistance; and (4) for any related
purposes as may be adopted in the policy set forth in this section. Said fees
shall be deposited to a special account in the Village's Finance Department
dedicated to the cost of implementation and enforcement of this section, and
fulfilling the purpose and intent of this section. None of the funds provided
for in this section shall be utilized for the legal defense of foreclosure
actions.
      (6)   Each individual property on the registry that has been registered
for 6 months or more prior to the effective date shall have 30 days to renew
the registration and pay the non-refundable $325 semi-annual registration fee.
Properties registered less than 6 months prior to the effective date shall
renew the registration every 6 months from the expiration of the original
registration renewal date and shall pay the non-refundable $325 semi-annual
registration fee.
      (7)   If the mortgage and/or servicing on a registrable property is sold
or transferred, the new mortgagee is subject to all the terms of this section.
Within 10 days of the transfer, the new mortgagee shall register the property
or update the existing registration. The previous mortgagee(s) will not be
released from the responsibility of paying all previous unpaid fees, fines and
penalties accrued during that mortgagee's involvement with the registrable
property.
      (8)   If the mortgagee sells or transfers the registrable property in a
non-arm's length transaction to a related entity or person, the transferee is
subject to all the terms of this section. Within 10 days of the transfer, the
transferee shall register the property or update the existing registration. Any
and all previous unpaid fees, fines and penalties, regardless of who the
mortgagee was at the time registration was required, including, but not limited
to, unregistered periods during the foreclosure process, are the responsibility
of the transferee and are due and payable with the updated registration. The
previous mortgagee will not be released from the responsibility of paying all
previous unpaid fees, fines and penalties accrued during that mortgagee's
involvement with the foreclosed property.
      (9)   If the foreclosing or foreclosed property is not registered, or the
registration fee is not paid within 30 days of when the registration or renewal
is required pursuant to this section, a late fee equivalent to 10% of the semi-
annual registration fee shall be charged for every 30-day period, or portion
thereof, the property is not registered and shall be due and payable with the
registration.
      (10)   This section shall also apply to properties that have been the
subject of a foreclosure sale where title is transferred to the mortgagee as
well as any properties transferred to the mortgagee under a deed in lieu of
foreclosure or by any other legal means.
      (11)   Properties subject to this section shall remain subject to the
semi-annual registration requirement, and the inspection, security and
maintenance standards of this section, as long as the property remains
registrable property.
      (12)   Failure of the mortgagee and/or property owner of record to
properly register or to modify the registration to reflect a change of
circumstances as required by this section is a violation of this section and
shall be subject to enforcement by any of the enforcement means available to
the Village.
      (13)   If any property is in violation of this section, the Village may
take the necessary action to ensure compliance with and/or place a lien on the
property for the cost of the outstanding obligation and any additional cost
incurred to the property into compliance.
      (14)   Registration of foreclosure property does not alleviate the
mortgagee and/or owner from obtaining all required licenses, permits and
inspections required by applicable code or state statutes. Acquisition of
required licenses, permits and inspections or registration of rental property
does not alleviate the requirement for the property to be registered under this
section. Mortgagee and/or owner is expected to update the status of the
property in the event of a mortgagee managed rental.
   (F)   Inspection and registration of real property that is not subject to
mortgage in foreclosure.

proceeding in accordance with Chapter 39 of the Village Code by serving a
notice of violation or notice of hearing on all owners of record, beneficial
owners of any Illinois land trust having title to the property, and all lien
holders of record in the property, in person or, if the entity being served is

building or structure as specified in the Hearing Officer’s order.

an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to abate a public nuisance
described in this section. If the court finds that the Village has established
by a preponderance of the evidence that the building or structure identified in
the notice is a public nuisance as described in this section, the court shall
enter an order of abatement which requires the owner or owners of record,
including beneficial owners of any Illinois land trust, within the time frame
specified in the order, to take all reasonable measures necessary to abate the
public nuisance. The court’s order of abatement may include, but is not limited
to: correcting all code violations; altering, repairing or improving the
building or structure, rendering the building or structure fit for human use or
habitation; vacating or enclosing the building or structure; removing or
demolishing the building or structure; the appointment of a receiver;

the Village shall be subject to abatement in accordance with the provisions of
this section.
   (E)   Pre-abatement procedure.
      (1)   Upon a determination by the Village that a property is a chronic
public nuisance, the Chief of Police or his/her designee shall notify the
owner, person in charge and occupants of the property that the property has
been determined to be a chronic public nuisance. The notice shall be served by
certified mail, return-receipt requested, or by personal service, and shall
contain the following information:
         (a)   The street address or legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
         (b)   A statement that the Chief of Police has determined the property
to be a chronic public nuisance with a concise description of the public
nuisance activities leading to his/her findings.
         (c)   Demand that the owner and person in charge respond within 10
days of the date of the notice to the Chief of Police and propose a course of
action that the Chief of Police agrees will abate the public nuisance
activities giving rise to the Chronic Public Nuisance.
      (2)   A copy of the notice shall be posted at the property after 10 days
has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the owner and person
in charge of the property, if said persons have not contacted the Chief of
Police.
      (3)   The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may
be a chronic public nuisance shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
proceedings under this section.
      (4)   If, after notification in accordance with division (E)(1) above,
but prior to commencement of legal proceedings by the Village pursuant to this
section, the owner and/or person in charge of the property stipulate with the
Chief of Police that the owner will pursue a course of action that the parties
agree will abate the public nuisance activities giving rise to the chronic
public nuisance of the property, the Chief of Police may agree to postpone
legal proceedings for a period of not less than 10 nor more than 40 days. If
the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the public
nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within the
agreed time, the Chief of Police shall request authorization for the Village
Attorney to commence a legal proceeding to abate the chronic public nuisance.
      (5)   Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the
Chief of Police shall send copies of the notice, as well as any other
documentation which supports legal proceedings, to the Village Attorney.
      (6)   When an owner or person in charge makes a response to the Chief of
Police as required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with the
furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any public
nuisance activities have or are occurring. This section does not require the
exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered for any
other purpose.
   (F)   Judicial abatement procedure. Following notice, the Village Attorney
may initiate legal proceedings, either in the circuit court or through the
Village’s administrative adjudication program, to abate the chronic public
nuisance, and to seek the penalties and remedies provided in this section.
COURT, as used in this section, shall refer to either a circuit court judge or
administrative hearing officer, as applicable.
   (G)   Commencement of action, burden of proof.
      (1)   In an action seeking abatement of a chronic public nuisance
property, the Village shall have the initial burden of showing by a
preponderance of the evidence that the property constitutes a chronic public
nuisance.
      (2)   It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a chronic
public nuisance property that the owner or person in charge of the property, at
the time in question, could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or
diligence, determine that the property had become a chronic public nuisance
property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and
diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that the property is a
chronic public nuisance property.
   (H)   Abatement remedy; penalty.
      (1)   Upon being satisfied by affidavits or other sworn evidence that an
alleged chronic public nuisance exists, the Court may without notice or bond
enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to enjoin any
defendant from maintaining such nuisance or otherwise restraining any defendant
in his or her use of the property.
      (2)   In the event the Court determines a property to be a chronic public
nuisance property, the Court may, in addition to any other remedies provided by
this Section, enter an order requiring the taking of measures designed to
eliminate the chronic public nuisance, including but not limited to making
improvements to the property and installing security lighting, hiring licensed
and insured security personnel, the appointment of a receiver, the initiation
and execution of eviction proceedings against tenants engaged in illicit
activities or restraining the owner, person in charge of the property and/or
occupants from using the property for any purpose for a period of up to one
year. The order may further provide that the owner, person in charge of the
property and/or occupants shall have the right to use the property during a
period of time specified in the order if the owner, person in charge of the
property and/or occupants post a bond or other security payable to the Village
and approved by the Court in an amount between $1,000 and $50,000, which bond
or security shall be forfeited and paid over to the Village in the event that
any offense set forth in division (B) of this section is committed upon the
property within the period of time set forth in the Court order.
      (3)   In addition to any other remedy provided in this section, the Court
may impose upon the owner of the property, who (a) intentionally, knowingly,
recklessly, or negligently encouraged or permitted an illegal activity,
described in division (B) of this section, to occur or continue on the
property, or who (b) failed to implement the reasonable and warranted abatement
measures agreed upon, as provided in division (E)(4) of this section, a civil
penalty in the amount of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 per day for
each day on which the property constituted a chronic public nuisance, said
penalty to be payable to the Village of Maywood. In establishing the amount of
any civil penalty requested, the Court may consider any of the following
factors it finds appropriate and shall cite those found applicable:
         (a)   The actions or lack of action taken by the owner to mitigate or
correct the chronic public nuisance at the property.
         (b)   Whether the public nuisance activity at the property was
repeated or continuous.
         (c)   The magnitude or gravity of the public nuisance activities.
         (d)   The cooperation or lack thereof of the owner and/or person in
charge of the property with the Village.
         (e)   The costs of the Village in investigating and correcting or
attempting to correct the public nuisances.
      (4)   The Court may authorize the Village to physically secure the
property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within
the time specified by the Court.
      (5)   All costs incurred by the Village in investigating and correcting
or attempting to correct public nuisances hereunder, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs in bringing any enforcement action hereunder, shall
be assessed as a lien against the property, as may all costs reasonably
incurred by the Village to affect the closure of a property where ordered, and
any tenant relocation costs. Prior to placing said lien, the Village shall
submit a statement of such costs to the Court for its review. If no objection
to the statement is made within the period described by the Court, a lien in
said amount may be recorded against said property.
      (6)   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty
by the Court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the Village.
      (7)   A tenant is entitled to reasonable relocation costs payable by the
owner, as determined by the Court if, without actual notice, the tenant moved
into the property, after either:
         (a)   The owner or person in charge received notice as described
herein of the Police Chief’s determination as described above; or
         (b)   An unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action
brought pursuant to this section.
   (I)   Emergency closing procedures.
      (1)   In the event that the Chief of Police determines that the property
is an immediate threat to the public safety and welfare, the Village may apply
to the Court for such interim relief as may be determined appropriate by the
Chief of Police. In such an event, the notification provision in division (E)
(1) need not be satisfied; however, the Village shall make a diligent effort to
notify the owner, person in charge of the property and occupants prior to a
court hearing.
      (2)   In the event that the Court finds the property to constitute a
chronic public nuisance property, as defined herein, the Court may order the
remedies set out above. In addition, in the event that it also finds that the
owner had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting or
violating this section and permitted the activities to occur, the Court may
assess a civil fine as provided above.

§ 150.037 CRIME-FREE HOUSING.
   (A)   Commencing July 1, 2012, and thereafter, a license to operate as a
landlord within the Village pursuant to §
150.100 of this Code shall not issue to a landlord unless the landlord, or his/
her designated agent, has attended and successfully completed a crime-free
housing education course conducted by the Village of Maywood. The Village’s
crime-free housing education course shall be facilitated by the Police, Fire
and Building and Code Enforcement Departments, and will, among other things,
review the tenant screening process, property maintenance code, inspections
process, vacant property registry and requirements, chronic public nuisance
ordinance, fire safety, any other Village codes or regulations deemed
appropriate, and how to make the rental property environment safe and free of
crime.
   (B)   In the event that a landlord submits registration materials and has
met all other license requirements, but a crime-free housing education course
is not available, a conditional license may be issued, effective for no more
than 3 months from the date of issuance, subject to attendance and successful
completion by the landlord, or his/her designated agent, of the crime-free
housing education course within that time period. Upon completion of the course
within the 3 month period, a license to operate as a landlord in the Village
shall be issued for the balance of the year. In the event the course is not
attended within 3 months, the conditional license shall be void without any
need of further action by the Village.
   (C)   In the event that a designated agent of the landlord attended a crime-
free housing education course conducted by the Village of Maywood to comply
with this section, and that agent is no longer employed by the landlord or
designated by the landlord to be responsible for managing the rental units, the
landlord, or a newly designated agent, shall attend and successfully complete
the course in the Village within 3 months of the termination or change. Failure
to do so shall result in the suspension or revocation of the license to operate
as a landlord in the Village.
   (D)   A landlord or designated agent must attend the Village of Maywood
crime-free housing education course at least every 2 years in order to be
eligible for renewal of a license to operate as a landlord within the Village.
Failure to maintain license eligibility by attending the course again prior to
the 2-year anniversary date of the previous course completion shall result in
the non-renewal, suspension or revocation of the license to operate as a
landlord within the Village. Notice of such nonrenewal, suspension or
revocation shall be delivered or mailed to the landlord, or designated agent,
at the address designated on the most recent registration form/license
application or at any current address provided by the landlord or agent.
   (E)   (1)   At any time prior to the 2-year anniversary date of the previous
Village of Maywood crime-free housing education course completion, a landlord
or designated agent may be required to attend and successfully complete the
crime-free housing education course again, if deemed necessary by the Village
Manager. Such requirement may be imposed based on the recommendation of the
crime-free housing coordinator to the Village Manager, who shall consider the
following in making such determination:
         (a)   Whether the rental units subject to the license is in danger of
becoming or has been designated as a chronic public nuisance as defined in §
150.036 of this Code; or
         (b)   Whether criminal activity is occurring on the rental unit
premises and the landlord has failed to initiate eviction proceedings or take
other appropriate action: or
         (c)   The landlord or designated agent has violated any provision of
this chapter: or
         (d)   Other circumstances that, in the reasonable discretion of the
Village Manager, cumulatively indicate a need for retraining.
      (2)   Failure to attend the Village of Maywood crime-free housing
education course within 3 months of being notified by the Village of Maywood of
a determination of the need for retraining shall result in the non-renewal,
suspension or revocation of the license to operate as a landlord within the
Village. Notice of the non-renewal, suspension or revocation shall be delivered
or mailed to the landlord, or designated agent, at the address designated on
the most recent registration form/license application or at any current address
provided by the landlord or agent.
   (F)   A crime free housing coordinator, to be designated by the Village
Manager, shall maintain a current updated list of landlords and/or designated
agents who have attended the crime-free housing education course, along with
the dates of attendance and verification that the landlord or designated agent
has otherwise complied with this Code to be eligible for issuance or renewal of
a license to operate as a landlord in the Village. The list shall be provided
to the Village Clerk, Finance Director, Village Manager, Building Director, and
Police Chief as it is updated.
   (G)   Commencing July 1, 2012, and thereafter, every lease, including lease
extensions, shall contain a crime-free lease addendum or contain a provision in
the lease substantially similar to a crime-free lease addendum. The purpose of
the crime-free lease addendum or provision is to make criminal activity,
including but not limited to violent or drug-related criminal activity, engaged
in by, facilitated by or permitted by the tenant, member of the household,
guest or other party under the control of the tenant, a lease violation where
the activity takes place within the leased premises or anywhere on the
landlord’s property, including within related parking areas and common areas.
The landlord shall be provided with authority under the addendum or similar
lease provision to initiate eviction proceedings pursuant to state law in the
event of criminal activity in violation of the addendum or lease provision.
Proof of a criminal violation shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.
Samples of crime-free lease addendums shall be available from the Building and
Code Enforcement Department. Failure to include a crime-free lease addendum or
provision in a lease or lease extension subsequent to July 1, 2012 may result
in citations or, in the event of repeated non-compliance, the suspension or
revocation of the license to operate as a landlord in the Village. The crime-
free lease addendum or provision shall be in substantially the following form:
   Crime-Free Housing Lease Addendum or Provision
   Prohibition against criminal activity on premises.
      1.   Neither the tenant, any member of the tenant’s household, tenant’s
guest(s) nor any person under tenant’s control shall engage in or facilitate
quasi-criminal or criminal activity on the leased premises or on the landlord’s
property, which includes the leased premises,
at                                     .
      2.   Neither the tenant, any member of the tenant’s household, tenant’s
guest(s), nor any person under tenant’s control shall permit the leased
premises or landlord’s property to be used for, or to facilitate, quasi-
criminal or criminal activity, regardless of whether the individual engaging in
such activity is a member of the household, or a quest.
      3.   Neither the tenant, any member of the tenant’s household, tenant’s
guest(s), nor any person under tenant’s control shall engage in or facilitate
any breach of the lease agreement that jeopardizes the health, safety, and
welfare of the landlord, his or her agent or any other tenant, or involves
imminent or actual serious property damage.
      4.   The tenant is vicariously liable for the quasi-criminal or criminal
activity on the leased premises or landlord’s property of any member of the
tenant’s household, Tenant’s guest(s), and any person under tenant’s control,
whether or not the tenant had knowledge of the activity or whether or not the
household member or guest was under the Tenant’s control.
      5.   One or more violations of subsections 1, 2 or 3 of this lease
addendum/provision during the term of the lease shall constitute a substantial
violation and a material noncompliance with the lease. Any such violation is
grounds for termination of tenancy and eviction from the leased premises.
Unless otherwise required by law, proof of violation shall not require a
criminal conviction, but shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.
      6.   In case of conflict between the provisions of this addendum/
provision and any other provisions of the lease, the provisions of this
addendum/provision shall govern.
      7.   For purposes of this lease addendum/provision, quasi-criminal or
criminal activity shall mean a violation of the Maywood Village Code or other
violation of local, state, or federal law.

   (A)   Certificate of compliance required. Except as otherwise provided in
this section, a certificate of compliance shall be required prior to any sale
or rental of any lot, dwelling unit, building, structure, improvement, or part
thereof (hereinafter collectively referred to in this section as “property”).
This certificate of compliance shall be based upon compliance of the property
with the minimum standards for health and safety as prescribed by this chapter
and with all other applicable building, housing, health and zoning ordinances
and regulations of the Village.
   (B)   Application. The certificate of compliance shall be applied for by the
owner, lessor, or authorized agent. The applications shall be made to the
Building Director on such forms as they may prescribe. The application form
shall include a statement that the owner or occupant has a right to withhold
consent to a compliance inspection by the Village and require the Village to
obtain a warrant to conduct the inspection and a statement that the Village
must request and obtain the consent of the occupant of any occupied rental
dwelling prior to conducting any inspection. The application shall include a
space for the owner and/or occupant to indicate that the owner and/or occupant
consents to a compliance inspection, or refuses consent.

District, other applicable state, federal, county or other laws or regulatory
requirements relating to sewer and/or water lines and service, and any other
applicable ordinances set forth in this Code.
   (D)   Inspections. The Building Director, after an application for a
certificate of compliance has been made for a property to be offered for sale
or rent, shall be responsible for seeing that the required or necessary
inspections and reinspections of the exterior and interior of the property, and

of the Village’s zoning and/or occupancy limitations, as set forth in its fire
and property maintenance codes; and is not a legal nonconforming use under the
zoning regulations of the Village, as amended. Following inspection, the
Building and Code Enforcement Department shall, where violations are found,
furnish a report on the violations to the owner, lessor or other person in
control of the property. In the event the inspection reveals that a property
has been illegally converted, the Building and Code Enforcement Department
shall issue a notice of deconversion, specifying the measures which must be
taken in order to bring the illegally converted property into compliance with
all applicable Village zoning and other codes. All dwelling units, buildings,
structures, and improvements or parts thereof, except property containing less
than 2 dwelling units used solely for residential purposes, must be inspected

represents as a listing or selling agent any residential property located
within the Village shall, before selling the property, and within 5 days after
the first real estate listing agreement is entered into and/or public
notification of such intent to sell or rent is made, whichever shall occur
first, notify the Building and Code Enforcement Department on forms to be
provided by the Village of their intent to rent or sell the property.
   (G)   Requirements for issuance. No certificate of compliance shall be
issued for any property unless each of the following criteria has been met;
      (1)   The Building and Code Enforcement Department has received
notification as required by this section;
      (2)   The property has been inspected for compliance with all applicable
Village building, housing, health and zoning ordinances and regulations and a
report of the inspections and/or a notice of deconversion has been prepared,
which report and/or notice shall be furnished to the owner, lessor or other
person in control of the property which was inspected;
      (3)   A report from the Water Department is received by the Community
Development Director which states that a final reading as to the amount due for
water services has been made and that there are no unpaid water bills;
      (4)   The Building and Code Enforcement Department has verified that
there are no other outstanding Village liens or judgments against the property;
      (5)   If property is found not to comply with the health, building,
housing, zoning and other applicable ordinances and regulations of the Village,
or is found to have been illegally converted, then an estimate of the cost of
bringing the property into compliance shall be prepared by a person qualified
to do the work necessary to bring the property into compliance. Where a license
or permit is required or other standard is set by the ordinances of this
Village or by other government regulations, the term”qualified” shall mean a
person so licensed or who otherwise meets the required standards. Such
qualified persons shall make available, upon request, copies of their licenses,
verification of their liability insurance, errors and omissions insurance
policies, and surety bond, if applicable. The estimate shall be in the form of
an offer to perform the necessary work for a specified price and shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Village Engineer; and
      (6)   No certificate of compliance shall be issued unless following the
inspection required under division (G)(2) of this section, the property has
been found to be in compliance with all applicable Village health, building,
housing and fire codes, except that with respect to the sale of property, a
conditional certificate of compliance may be issued pursuant to division (H).
   (H)   Escrow/conditional certificates of compliance. Property may be sold or
rented hereunder by an owner who has not completed required repairs or
deconversion identified through an inspection only pursuant to the following.
      (1)   If a sum of money equal to the estimated cost, as calculated
pursuant to division (G)(5) above, of bringing the property into compliance has
been deposited into an escrow account established with the Village for the
purpose of paying the cost of any repairs and other work which must be
performed in order for the property to be brought into compliance or if a
performance or surety bond issued by a reputable surety company and naming the
Village as obligee in an amount equal to the estimated cost of bringing the
property into compliance is furnished to the Building Director. In cases where
deconversion of an illegally converted property is required in order for a
property to be brought into compliance, the sum of money required to be placed
in escrow with the Village shall be $15,000 or 3 times the amount of the
repairs and other work which must be performed in order for a property to be
brought into compliance, whichever is higher.
      (2)   The buyer, conveyee, transferee, assignee or other successor in
title, ownership or interest (hereinafter “buyer”) has entered into an escrow
agreement with the Village whereby the buyer, in order to close, accepts
responsibility for bringing the property into compliance and agrees to do so
within 90 calendar days after the closing of the transaction (the “closing”). A
buyer who elects to accept the property, subject to the inspection with
existing violations or need to deconvert, and who enters into an escrow
agreement as provided herein, shall acknowledge, as part of any such agreement,
that the buyer is fully aware of the existing violations and/or need to
deconvert, as well as the possibility of violations that may have existed but
were unnoted or undiscovered due to lack of access, and agrees to accept the
requirement and obligation to bring the property into compliance within 90 days
of the closing. The seller is also required to sign the escrow agreement.
      (3)   Where the buyer enters into such an agreement, a conditional
certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Village and shall terminate on
the ninety-first day after closing. The Village shall issue a certificate of
compliance upon completion of the repairs and/or other work necessary to bring
the property into compliance. The buyer shall further agree to submit to the
jurisdiction and venue of the Village administrative adjudication process and
the Circuit Court of Cook County and to waive service of summons subject only
to the notice requirements as required by law in order to enable the Village to
expeditiously obtain an order of compliance with this section, if necessary.
      (4)   In the event the buyer fails to complete the required repairs, and/
or have the repairs verified on reinspection, by the date of termination of the
conditional certificate of compliance, the Building Director is authorized to
pursue enforcement proceedings through the Village administrative adjudication
process, or, at their discretion, through the Circuit Court of Cook County. The
Village is further authorized to pursue any other administrative or judicial
remedy in order to bring the property into compliance with applicable codes and
regulations, including an order allowing the Village as Escrowee to release the
funds to a contractor of its choosing to bring the violations into compliance.
The Village shall be entitled to draw on the escrow or performance bond for the
purpose of paying all costs associated with such enforcement proceedings,
including, but not limited to, consultant fees, engineering fees, attorney fees
and litigation expenses. Any and all costs of enforcement beyond the amount of
the escrow are a debt due and owing the Village and may be recorded as a lien
against the property if the balance beyond the escrow is not repaid to the
Village within 30 days following written demand by the Village.
      (5)   Fine for failure to repair or deconvert. The fine for violations of
this division (H) shall be not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 per day for
each day the violations or illegal conversion remain uncorrected following the
expiration of the 90 day period for correction following closing. The Village
shall be entitled to draw on the escrow or performance bond for the purpose of
paying any judgment amounts for fines under this division (H). Any judgment
amounts beyond the amount of the escrow that remain unpaid following the time
for payment and opportunity for judicial review are a debt due and owing the
Village and may be recorded by the Village as a lien against the property.
   (I)   No warranty or guarantee. Inspections made pursuant to this section
shall reflect the condition of the property only as of the date and time the
inspection was made. In issuing a conditional certificate of compliance or
certificate of compliance, the Village and its agents do not make any warranty
or representation of any kind, nor do they intend to insure or provide any
guarantee as to the condition of the property to either buyer or seller of the
property, or to any of their designees, agents, representatives, heirs or
assigns or any other interested party, including mortgage companies, insurance
companies, banks or any other party which may have any interest relative to the
property, nor does the Village affirm that there are no additional violations
relative to any other provisions of the Village Code, zoning and other
regulations, or relevant statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations of the
County of Cook, the State of Illinois or the United States.
   (J)   Disclosure to buyers and lessees. Whenever property is inspected
pursuant to this section, the owner, lessor or other person in control of the
property shall furnish all buyers and lessees of the property with a copy of
any inspection reports he or she has received from the Village. In the case of
a sale, this shall be done prior to closing. In the case of a lease, this shall
be done prior to the start of the term of the lease.
   (K)   Expiration of certificates of compliance and notices of violation and
deconversion. A certificate of compliance shall expire and shall no longer be
valid 90 days after the date it is issued. Certificates shall be renewed 1 time
by the Director ofCommunity Development upon application for renewal for an
additional 90 days. Provided that there has been no change in the property as
described in the certificate of compliance, such renewal shall be provided at
no charge. Certificates of compliance may not be renewed more than once. A
notice of violation or notice of deconversion shall be valid for 1 year toward
the issuance of a certificate but shall become invalid after a certificate has
been issued.
   (L)   Variation appeal procedure. A variation to the terms and conditions of
this section may be granted in those cases where the plight of the owner or
lessor is due to unique circumstances and where the variation, if granted, will
not pose a danger to the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the
Village, including any person who might occupy the property in question. A
variation shall be granted only after a hearing before a board consisting of
the Village Manager and the Building Director. This Board shall within 30 days
after the hearing make a written recommendation to the Village Board which
shall then have final authority to determine whether a variation from the terms
of this section shall be granted.
   (M)   Authority to inspect. 
      (1)   No inspection of any property shall be made for the purpose of
determining compliance with the codes, laws and ordinances of the Village,
including a determination of whether a certificate of compliance shall be
issued, unless either:
         (a)   A person in control of the property voluntarily agrees to permit
the inspection; or
         (b)   An administrative search warrant has been issued by a court
which authorizes the inspection.
      (2)   If a person in control of property which is otherwise sought to be
inspected under this section refuses to permit the inspection, the Building
Director shall apply for the issuance of an administrative search warrant which
will authorize the inspection. Any application for an administrative warrant
shall specify the basis upon which the warrant is being sought and shall
include a statement that the inspection will be limited to a determination of
whether there are violations of the Village’s building, housing, health and
zoning ordinances and regulations, and whether there have been any illegal
conversions. The Court may consider any of the following factors along with
such other matters as it deems pertinent in its decision as to whether a
warrant shall issue:
         (a)   Eyewitness account(s) of violation(s);
         (b)   Citizen complaints;
         (c)   Tenant complaints;
         (d)   Plain view violations;
         (e)   Violations apparent from Village records;

         (i)   Condition of similar properties in the area;
         (j)   Documented violations on similar properties in the area;
         (k)   Passage of time since last inspection;
         (l)   Previous violations on the property; and
         (m)   Whether the inspection is part of an exterior/interior property
inspection and code enforcement policy and program approved by the Village.
      (3)   If the court refuses to issue a search warrant to allow inspection
of the property, or the Village chooses not to seek an administrative search
warrant, then any other provision of this section notwithstanding, a
certificate of compliance shall not be required prior to any sale or rental of
the premises which occurs within 90 days from:
         (a)   The date the owner denied access for purposes of an inspection,
provided the Village declined to seek a warrant to authorize an inspection; or
         (b)   The date the court refused to issue the search warrant. In such
event, the Village shall advise the seller and, if possible, the buyer of the
property that the property is “uninspected property”.
   (N)   Exempt transactions.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, the terms sale, sell, or sold shall
not include:
         (a)   Transactions which encumber, but do not convey title to real
estate or assign the beneficial interest in a land trust;
         (b)   Transactions in which the deed, without additional
consideration, confirms, corrects, modifies or supplements a deed previously
recorded; and
         (c)   Transactions in which the deed constitutes a release of an
encumbrance.
      (2)   The requirements for an inspection or certificate of compliance do
not apply to such transactions.
   (O)   Zoning and occupancy posters. At the time of obtaining the certificate
of compliance, the property owner shall be given a poster by the Building and
Code Enforcement Department which shall state the zoning classification,
maximum occupancy, and any zoning and parking conditions governing the
property. This poster shall be displayed prominently in a window on the ground
floor facing the street on the property for sale or rent, in such a way that
the poster is visible from the street.
   (P)   Listing and advertising disclosure requirements. Realtors or owners
listing property for rental or sale in the Village are required to accurately
and completely set forth the type of residence (single-family, two-unit, multi-
family and the like), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square
footage of rooms, maximum occupancy limits of the property based on the
Village’s fire and property maintenance codes, and zoning classification and
zoning and parking conditions in any advertisement, brochure, description or
publication offering the property for sale, including any listing on the
Multiple Listing Service or any similar type of information service or source.
For newspaper advertisements, square footage of rooms, maximum occupancy,
zoning classification and zoning and parking conditions do not have to be
included.
   (Q)   Deconversion amnesty program. The Village Manager, in consultation
with the Building Director, may, in their discretion, from time to time,
declare and publicize a temporary “amnesty period” relative to illegally
converted properties within the Village as part of an overall effort to
eliminate existing illegal conversions. During any period of declared amnesty
for deconversions authorized by the Village, building permit fees may be
reduced or waived pursuant to a set published schedule of fee reductions
available to all property owners who own illegally converted properties and who
are making various modifications for the purpose of deconverting the property.
To participate in the amnesty program, a property owner must register with the
Building and Code Enforcement Department and allow the Department to conduct a
property inspection. Following the inspection, the Building and Code
Enforcement Department shall provide the property owner with a written list of
modifications that need to be made and/or violations that need to be remedied
in order to successfully deconvert and bring the property into compliance with
Village zoning, building and other codes and regulations. During the amnesty
period, and for a period of 3 months afterward, provided work is being done
under a Village-issued permit to deconvert the illegal occupancy, program
participants shall not be cited for code violations related to the existing
illegal conversion. Any amnesty program period shall be publicized by the
Village through newsletters and other appropriate means. Property owners who
take advantage of the reduced fees provided under an amnesty program and are
later found to have caused an illegal conversion to again exist on the property
will be subject to increased penalties under §
150.999.
   (R)   Fine for illegal conversion after issuance of certificate of
compliance. It shall be unlawful to alter, modify, or reconvert a property to
create an illegal conversion as defined in division (D) of this section after a
deconversion has occurred or after receiving a certificate of compliance.
Issuance of a certificate of compliance shall constitute prima facie evidence
of thelawful use of the property as described in the certificate, including
evidence that a deconversion has been completed. Any owner found to have
altered, modified, or reconverted a property to create an illegal conversion
following a deconversion by the owner or a previous owner, shall be subject to
an enhanced fine of not less than $250 and not more than $1,500, with each day
such illegal conversion exists constituting a distinct and separate offense.

Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-1-1 et seq.). The purpose of this chapter
is to maintain the Village’s eligibility in the National Flood Insurance
Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss
of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption fo commerce

enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and
provide for the wise utilization of water and related land resources.

purposes:
      (1)   To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/18g, the Rivers, Lakes and
Streams Act;
      (2)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or
drainage hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to
erosion;
      (3)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;

of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
   ACT. An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams
of the State of Illinois (615 ILCS 5/5 et seq.).
   APPLICANT. Any person, firm, corporation or governmental agency who executes
the necessary forms to procure official approval of a project or permit to
carry out construction of a project from the Village of Maywood.
   APPROPRIATE USE. Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible
and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed
are as specified in §
152.07(B)(4).
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured  home, mobile home or a prefabricated building. This term also
includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site
for more than 180 days, unless fully licensed and ready for highway use.
   CHANNEL. Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash, or natural or man-made drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION. Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION includes
damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. CHANNELIZATION is a severe form
of CHANNEL MODIFICATION involving a significant change in the channel cross-
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.
straightening).
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off-site floodwater elevations and flows.
   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE. Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this chapter, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as-built plans.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A letter which indicates that
FEMA will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood
boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective Flood Hazard Boundary Map or
Flood Insurance Rate Map, once the as-built plans are submitted and approved.
   CONTROL STRUCTURE. A structure designed to control the rate of flow that
passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water
surface elevation.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare
of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of CRITICAL FACILITIES where flood
protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of CRITICAL FACILITIES where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
   DAM. All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
   DESIGNATED FLOODWAY. The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that
portion of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by
IDNR/OWR, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year frequency
flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to the loss
of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a 10% increase in velocities.
      (1)   The floodways are designated for DesPlaines River and Silver Creek
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by FEMA on Map Number 17031 C dated
August 19, 2008. When 2 floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more
restrictive floodway limit shall prevail.
      (2)   The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that
are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village that may be annexed
into the Village are designated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by
FEMA on Map Number 17031 C dated August 19, 2008.
      (3)   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the
designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map
and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the designated
floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any man-made change to real estate, including:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, repair, or placement of a building
or any addition to a building.

(Ord. C0-08-33, passed 8-19-2008)
§ 152.03 HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   The Community Development Director shall be responsible for fulfilling
all of the duties listed in §
152.04. To fulfill those duties, the Community Development Director first
should use the criteria listed in §
152.05, Base Flood Elevations, to determine whether the development site is
located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site is located
within a floodplain, the Community Development Director must determine whether
the development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within
a SFHA or floodplain for which no floodway has been identified. If the site is
within a flood fringe, the Community Development Director shall require that
the minimum requirements of §
152.06 be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Community Development
Director shall require that the minimum requirements of §
152.07 be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no
detailed study has been completed and approved, the Community Development
Director shall require that the minimum requirements of §
152.08 be met.
   (B)   ln addition, the general requirements of §
152.09 shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of §§
152.06,
152.07, or
152.08. The Community Development Director shall assure that all subdivision
proposals shall meet the requirements of §
152.10.
   (C)   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Code Enforcement
Director shall review the requirements of §
152.11 to make sure they are met. In addition, the Community Development
Director shall complete all notification requirements.
   (D)   ln order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in
this chapter, the Community Development Director may take any and all actions
as outlined in §
152.13.
(Ord. C0-08-33, passed 8-19-2008; Am. Ord. CO-09-27, passed 10-6-2009)
§ 152.04 DUTIES OF ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL.
   The Community Development Director shall be responsible for the general
administration and enforcement of this chapter which shall include the
following:
   (A)   Determining the floodplain designation. Check all new development
sites to determine whether they are in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). If
they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or
in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which
drains more than 1 square mile. Check whether the development is potentially
within an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1 square mile),
indicating that the development would have adverse impacts regarding storage,
conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being
required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the
remaining sections of this chapter.
   (B)   Professional engineer review. If the development site is within a
floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted
and which drains more than 1 square mile, the permit shall be referred to a
registered professional engineer under the employ or contract of the Village
for review to ensure that the development meets §
152.07 or
152.08. In the case of an appropriate use, the P.E. shall state in writing that
the development meets the requirements of §
152.07.
   (C)   Dam safety requirements. Dams are classified as to their size and
their hazard/damage potential in the event of failure. The construction or
major modification of all Class I (high hazard) and Class II (moderate hazard)
dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit. Some Class III (low hazard) dams
require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit, depending on the drainage area to the
dam, the height of the dam and the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most
off-channel detention basins that have an embankment are non-jurisdictional
Class III dam. It is not required that IDNR/OWR “sign off” on all non-
jurisdictional Class III dams. A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge
can estimate a hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety
permit is required. A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for
the construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams. Regulated dams
may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures.
   (D)   Other permit requirements. Ensure that any and all required federal,
state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
   (E)   Plan review and permit issuance. Ensure that all development
activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the Village meet the
requirements of this chapter and issue a floodplain development permit in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this
community when the development meets the conditions of this chapter.
   (F)   Inspection review. Inspect all development projects before, during and
after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter and schedule on an annual basis
an inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the inspection.
   (G)   Damage determinations. Make damage determinations of all damaged
buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged
structures which must comply with §
152.09(C)(3).
   (H)   Elevation and floodproofing certificates. Maintain in the permit files
an elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of a residential or non-residential building subject to §
152.09, and/or the elevation to which a non-residential building has been
floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to §
152.09.
   (I)   Records for public inspection. Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies
of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, Conditional
Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Amendment and
“as-built” elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all
buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
   (J)   State permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to §§
152.07 and
152.08, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the Village.
However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the Village and
shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      (1)   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per the
Illinois Compiled Statutes;
      (2)   IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in §
152.02 and all other state, federal or local unit of government projects,
including projects of the Village and County, except for those projects meeting
the requirements of §
152.07(B)(10);
      (3)   An engineer’s determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per §
152.07(B)(6)(e);
      (4)   An engineer’s analysis of the flood profile due to §
152.07(B)(6)(d);
      (5)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage as indicated in §
152.07(B)(6)(a), (b) and (h);
      (6)   Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly
navigable rivers, lakes and streams;
      (7)   Any changes in the base flood elevation or floodway locations; and
      (8)   Base flood elevation determinations where none now exist.
   (K)   Cooperation with other agencies. Cooperate with state and federal
floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency
flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this chapter.
Submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a regulatory map
within 6 months whenever a modification of the floodplain may change the base
flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain map. Submit reports as
required for the National Flood Insurance Program, and notify FEMA of any
proposed amendments to this chapter.
   (L)   Promulgate regulations. Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary

§ 152.05 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.
   (A)   This chapter’s protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance
Study for the Village. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood
elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard
shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State
Water Survey’s Floodplain Information Repository that has been approved by
IDNR/OWR and FEMA. When a party disagrees with the best available data, he
shall submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with
better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration
prior to any development of the site.
   (B)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
DesPlaines River and Silver Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of the Village prepared by FEMA and dated
August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared
from time to time.
   (C)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the Village shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Cook
County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19,2008, and such amendments or
revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   (D)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an “AH Zone” or “AO Zone” shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Village.
   (E)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an “A Zone” on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of
the Village shall be according to the best existing data available from
federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering
study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations.
When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined
from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP.
The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a
hydrologic model, such as HEC-I, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in
various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for
estimating peak flood discharges. Along any watercourses draining more than 1
square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval.
Once approved it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey
Floodplain Information Repository for filing. For a non-riverine SFHA, the base
flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus 3 feet, unless
calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by IDNR/OWR for
drainage areas greater than 1 square mile. For an unmapped extended SFHA (with
a drainage area less than 1 square mile) which has been identified by the
Community Development Director pursuant to §
152.04(A), the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant
utilizing a method as approved in above, with concurrence of the Community
Development Director.

§ 152.06 OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.
   (A)   Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of
this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems.
   (B)   Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the
requirements of this section, along with the requirements of §
152.09.
      (1)   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by
law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
development permit from the Community Development Director.
      (2)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the Community Development Director. The application shall be
accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed
engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in M.S.L., NAVD
88 and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location
and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed
buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest
adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will
be subject to the requirements of §
152.09.
      (3)   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Community
Development Director shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can
be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood
Insurance Rate Map and which has not been filled after the date of the site’s
first Flood Insurance Rate Map without a permit as required by this chapter is
not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base
flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current Flood
Insurance Rate Map is subject to the provisions of this chapter. The Community
Development Director shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map
identification.
      (4)   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall
be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.
      (5)   The Community Development Director shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local
permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this
type of activity. The Community Development Director shall not issue a permit
unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.
      (6)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe
shall create a threat to public health and safety.
      (7)   Preventing increased damages. If fill is being used to elevate the
site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant
shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from
FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
      (8)   Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and
watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas
so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
      (9)   Compensatory storage; construction of the lowest floor below the
base flood elevation (BFE). A person who has obtained a Letter of Map Revision
based on fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due
to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit
from the Village to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below
the BFE in the flood fringe. The Community Development Director shall not issue
such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth
in the following:
         (a)   Compensatory storage shall be provided per §
152.06(B)(8).
         (b)   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE).
         (c)   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above
the FPE, for a minimum distance of 10 feet beyond the outside face of the
structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
met, the Community Development Director may waive the 10-foot minimum setback
if an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative
method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has
been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and
structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the Community
Development Director for review. The Community Development Director may require
such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter
setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the
setback distance be less than 4 feet.
         (d)   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if
site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the
Community Development Director may waive the 20-foot minimum setback distance
if an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative
method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have
been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a
shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding,
shall be submitted to the Village for review. In no case shall the setback
distance be less than 4 feet.
         (e)   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that
meets all requirements of this division (B)(9) and is at least 5 feet thick
under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this division (B)(9) shall be
interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as
part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar
classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC
or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for
Engineering Purposes.
         (f)   The fill material must be homogeneous (i.e., all of one
material) and isotropic (i.e., having the same engineering properties) and the
engineering priorities must be in the same direction.
         (g)   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified
and inspected by an Illinois Licensed Professional Engineer, as warranted by
the site conditions.
         (h)   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
5 feet below the BFE.
         (i)   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab,
and minimum of 3 horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be
provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at 4 times the
estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the
building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor
under the effect of the seepage pressure.
         (j)   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
         (k)   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand
hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
         (l)   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth above in this division (B)(9), the Community Development Director may
allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant
demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and
requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe
from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is
reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed
engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered
basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA
Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an
Illinois Registered Professional Engineer.
         (m)   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site,
in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed 18 inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The
rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if
necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly
to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain
the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

Director shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal and
state permits have been obtained. A Registered Professional Engineer, under the
employ or contract of the Village shall review and approve applications
reviewed under this section.
      (4)   Preventing increased damages. The only development in a floodway
which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the
base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health
and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions
of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or
aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate
mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses
listed in 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate
uses are as follows:
         (a)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.
         (b)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
         (c)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
         (d)   Underground and overhead utilities;
         (e)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail
systems, including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from any
1 direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block flood
flows nor reduce floodway storage;
         (f)   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable
accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway
storage;
         (g)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
         (h)   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
            1.   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event
will not exceed 1.0 foot; or
            2.   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility
parking lot, formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events
and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all
overbank flooding events.
         (i)   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a
positive non-erosive slope toward a watercourse.
         (j)   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than 10 feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure,
and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure.
         (k)   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged
building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the
building was damaged to 50% or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection
elevation.
         (l)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase
the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building is improved to 50% or more of the market value before the modification
occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from
flooding to the flood protection elevation.
      (5)   Engineering and mitigation criteria. Appropriate uses do not
include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building
additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to
accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including
landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials
except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. Within the
designated floodway as identified on the floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR,
the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided
that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation
criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and
data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure
meets the protection requirements of §
152.09.
         (a)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            1.   Designated floodway conveyance, “K” = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where
“n” is Manning’s roughness factor, “A” is the effective flow area of the cross-
section, and “R” is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open
Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.)
            2.   The same Manning’s “n” value shall be used for both existing
and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover.
            3.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
               A.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of 1
foot horizontal for every 4 feet of the flooded stream’s length.
               B.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of 1
foot horizontal for every 1 foot of the flooded stream’s length.
               C.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of 1 foot vertical transition for every 10 feet of stream
length shall be used.
               D.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
               E.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.
         (b)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase
downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5
times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost
due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be
replaced. The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between
the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All designated
floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the
compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant’s engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. There shall be no reduction
in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such
modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
         (c)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts
or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in
the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. In the case of bridges
or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water
in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the
structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use
of rip-rap or other design measures.
         (d)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for
all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the
upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
            1.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
152.05. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for
the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/
Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation
procedures.
            2.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per §
152.07(B)(6)(b).
            3.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per §
152.07(B)(6)(c).
            4.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used
for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
            5.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by §
152.07(B)(4).
            6.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per §
152.07(B)(6)(h).
         (e)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts,
and approach roads.
            1.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
            2.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant’s engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
            3.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
         (f)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water.
Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to
the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing
vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection
grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the
stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as
defined in §
152.02 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a
modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall
be demonstrated that:
            1.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
            2.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous
fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life
cycle, such as for spawning;
            3.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin;
            4.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.
If there is more than 1 municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
            5.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
         (g)   Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial
structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than 10 feet from the outside of the building.
Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities.
         (h)   Excavation in the floodway. When excavation is proposed in the
design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and
replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for
lost conveyance or other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through
engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be
used with the same efficiency:
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of 1
foot horizontal for every 4 feet of the flooded stream’s length;
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of 1 foot
horizontal for every 1 foot of the flooded stream’s length; and
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical, a minimum
of 1 foot vertical transition for every 10 feet of stream length shall be used.
            4.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
         (i)   If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it
shall be demonstrated that:
            1.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures
from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the
establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification
is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water
quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
            2.   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
            3.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
               A.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
               B.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at
both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they
will prevent erosion.
               C.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
               D.   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel.
               E.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
               F.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall
be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
               G.    If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such
features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and
flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established,
where appropriate.
               H.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end
of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
               I.    New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and
all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
               J.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
               K.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
            4.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
         (j)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
         (k)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in
the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
            1.   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the
initiation of improvements.
            2.   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied
to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but
will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days.
            3.   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
            4.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be
preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (see
division (B)(6)(p) of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall
be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary,
to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be
restabilized immediately.
            5.   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with “Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois” (1988) also known as the
“Green Book” and “The Illinois Urban Manual” (NRCS, 1995).
         (l)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control
projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if
the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         (m)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
            1.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in §152.05, must be used for analysis of the base
conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have
changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the
appropriate base conditions data to use.
            2.   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of
the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
               A.   The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency
flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
               B.   Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.
            3.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next 5
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         (n)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision. If the appropriate use would
result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all
information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional
designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional
concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. The
final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans
or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating
activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. In the case of non-
government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in
unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated
floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. No filling,
grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval
is issued. After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
         (o)   Professional engineer’s supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional
engineer.
         (p)   For all activities in the floodway involving construction within
25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
            1.   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
            2.   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
            3.   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated
floodway change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may
proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an
appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is
changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received. The designated floodway
map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the
“as-built" plans.”
         (q)   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map Revision,
construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no
buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use
may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a
final Letter of Map Revision is received. The designated floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the “as-built”
plans.
      (6)   Development activities in delegated communities requiring state
review. For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the
following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and
concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or
county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway:
         (a)   An engineer’s analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed
bridge pursuant to division (B)(6)(d) of this section.
         (b)   An engineer’s determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, pursuant to division (B)(6)(e) of this section.
         (c)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
storage pursuant to division (B)(6)(a), (b), and (h).
         (d)   The construction of any IDNR/OWR projects, dams (as defined in §
152.02) and all other state, federal, or local units of government projects,
including projects of the municipality or county.
         (e)   An engineer’s determination that a proposed bridge affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller
opening.
         (f)   Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood
profiles.
         (g)   Projects in public bodies of water.
      (7)   Other permits. In addition to the other requirements of this
chapter, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be
issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation
that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to ILCS Ch. 615,
Act 5, §§ 5 et seq. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has
delegated this responsibility to the Village.
      (8)   Permits for dams. Any work involving the construction, modification
or removal of a dam as defined in §
152.02 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall
obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the
Community Development Director finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR
permit, the Community Development Director shall immediately notify the IDNR/
OWR Schaumburg office. If the Community Development Director finds a dam which
is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Community Development Director shall
immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Schaumburg office, and
the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
      (9)   Activities that do not require a Registered Professional Engineer’s
review. The following activities may be permitted without a Licensed
Professional Engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements.
         (a)   Underground and overhead utilities that:
            1.   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations,
or
            2.   Do not require the placement of above ground structures in the
floodway, or
            3.   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the
pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of 3 feet below the existing streambed,
and
            4.   Overhead utility lines shall be constructed above the
estimated 100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the low chord of
an existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No supporting
towers shall be placed in the watercourse and shall be designed so as to not
catch debris.
            5.   Disturbance of streamside vegetation shall be kept to minimum
during construction to prevent erosion and sedimentation. All disturbed
floodway areas, including the stream banks shall be restored to their original
contours and seeded or otherwise stabilized upon completion of construction.
            6.   A utility crossing carrying material which may cause water
pollution as defined by the Environmental Protection Act, 415 ILCS 5 (1992
State Bar Edition) shall be provided with shut-off valves on each side of the
body of water to be crossed.
            7.   All Illinois Commerce Commission, National Electric Safety
Codes, and federal requirements for clearance must be met.
         (b)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls that:
            1.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope, and
            2.    Do not result in an increase in ground elevation,
            3.   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall
location.
         (c)   Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences),
properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade.
         (d)   Construction of shoreline and streambank protection that:
            1.   Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length.
            2.   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank.
            3.   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional
area of the stream channel or bank of the lake.
            4.   Stabilization utilizing native vegetation and gradual side
slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems.
Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use
of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete,
construction rubble, and gabions should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
         (e)   Temporary stream crossings in which:
            1.   The approach roads will be 2 foot or less above natural grade.
            2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert.
            3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least 2
feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be non-
erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel.
            4.   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction.
            5.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within
1 year after authorization.

§ 152.08 OCCUPATION AND USE OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS ARE
NOT IDENTIFIED.
   In SFHA or floodplains, (including AE, AH, AO and Unnumbered A Zones) where
no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile,
no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the
proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and
structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of
the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation.
   (A)   Development permit.
      (1)   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body, not exempted by
state law, shall commence any development in a SFHA or floodplain without first
obtaining a development permit from the Community Development Director.
Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the
Community Development Director. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions; and
existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or
filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevations of
the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the
requirements of §
152.09. The application for a development permit shall also include the
following information:
         (a)   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose,
and intended use;
         (b)   Site location (including legal description) of the property,
drawn to scale, on the designated floodway maps, indicating whether it is
proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;
         (c)   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity;
         (d)   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include
as a minimum:
            1.   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the
waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic
or numerical scale, and north arrow;
            2.   A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing
existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
structure or work, elevations in mean sea level NAVD88, adjacent property lines
and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, distance between proposed
activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is in or near a
commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and
orientation of cross-sections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale;
            3.   Cross-section views of the project perpendicular to the flow
of floodwater and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed
conditions including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view,
existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency
flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical
scales (horizontal and vertical); and
            4.   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed
areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.
         (e)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted
showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of division (D) of this
section.
         (f)   Any and all other federal, state, and local permits or approvals
that may be required for this type of development.
      (2)   Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois
State Water Survey’s Floodplain Information Repository, the Community
Development Director shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist
for the site, the developer’s engineer shall calculate the elevation according
to §
152.05(E). Any development located on land that can be shown to have been
higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map
Identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the
requirements of this chapter. The Community Development Director shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
      (3)   The Community Development Director shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local
permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this
type of activity. The Community Development Director shall not issue the
development permit unless all required federal, state, and local permits have
been obtained.
   (B)   Preventing increased damages.
      (1)   No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been
determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair
the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or
impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be
minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter.
      (2)   Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been
determined, the following standards shall apply:
         (a)   The developer shall have a Registered Professional Engineer
state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations, and data that
the project meets the engineering requirements of §
152.07(B)(6)(a) through (l) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the
provisions of §
152.05(E). As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study
performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to IDNR/OWR
for acceptance as a designated floodway. Upon acceptance of the floodway by
IDNR/OWR, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the
requirements of §
152.07 for the designated floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to
the definition in §
152.02.
         (b)   A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant
first obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR.
         (c)   No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has
delegated permit responsibility to the Village per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part, Part
3708 for designated floodways.
         (d)   Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction,
modification or removal of a dam as defined in §
152.02 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall
obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the
Community Development Director finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR
permit, the Community Development Director shall immediately notify the IDNR/
OWR Schaumburg office. If the Community Development Director finds a dam which
is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Community Development Director shall
immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Schaumburg office, and
the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
         (e)   Activities allowed without engineer review. The following
activities may be permitted without a Licensed Professional Engineer’s review
or calculation of base flood elevation and designated floodway. Such activities
shall still meet the other requirements of this chapter.
            1.   Bridge and culvert crossings of streams in rural areas meeting

OWR Statewide Permit No. 13.
            13.   Special uses of public waters meeting conditions of IDNR/OWR
Statewide Permit No. 14.
            14.   Any development determined by IDNR/OWR to be located entirely
within a flood fringe area shall be exempt from state floodway permit
requirements.
            15.   The flood carrying capacity of any altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
         (f)   The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
      (3)   Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and
watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas
so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall

shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      (3)   Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (4)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer
lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all
manholes or other above ground openings located below the FPE are watertight.
   (B)   Carrying capacity and notification. For all projects involving channel
modification, fill, or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood
carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the
Village shall notify adjacent communities in writing 30 days prior to the

§ 153.04 REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO ELECTRONIC BILLBOARDS.
   It shall be unlawful to construct, erect, locate or maintain any electronic
billboard in the Village except in conformance with the requirements of §
153.03 and where the following additional requirements are met:
   (A)   Display times. Electronic billboards display times shall be subject to
the following limitations:
      (1)   Tri-Vision or multiple message signs must have a minimum display
time of 6 seconds in a fixed position, and the louver rotation time to change a
message shall be 1 second or less. Additionally, Tri-Vision or multiple message
signs must contain a mechanism that will stop the sign in 1 position if a
malfunction occurs.
      (2)   Variable message signs must not display any 1 message for less than
½ of a second, and no message may be repeated at intervals of less than 2
seconds. No segmented messages shall be displayed. No traveling message shall
travel at a rate slower than 16 light columns per second or faster than 32
columns per second.
   (B)   Village approval. No electronic billboard may be erected in the
Village without a public hearing and approval of the Village President and
Board of Trustees. The party petitioning for approval must provide notice of
the public hearing, in accordance with division (C). Application for erection
of an electronic billboard shall be made by submitting information relative to
the billboard to the Community Development Department and payment of any fees
relative to any zoning relief required prior to erection. Where no zoning
relief is required, the public hearing may be held before the Village President
and Board of Trustees following payment of an administrative fee of $150. For
all electronic billboard requests, the petitioning party is required to submit
a deposit of$15,000 to cover the Village’s costs in considering placement of
the electronic billboard, including the Village’s engineering and attorney
consulting fees relative to such consideration and approval. The petitioning
party remains obligated to pay the balance of the total actual fees and costs
incurred by the Village, including any costs incurred in excess of the initial
deposit, whether or not the billboard application is approved. Any portion of
the deposit that remains following approval or denial by the Village President
and Board of Trustees of the electronic billboard request shall be returned to
the petitioning party. The party petitioning for placement of an electronic
billboard shall submit to the Village for consideration prior to the public
hearing a photometric study related to the proposed billboard that shall
encompass illumination impact findings and proposed remedial/corrective options
to mitigate the effects of light pollution and glare. Conversion of an existing
non- electronic billboard, replacement of an existing billboard that increases
the size, installing additional electronic screen(s)/monitors, or installation
or replacement of components that increase the illumination shall constitute a
new billboard and requires a public hearing and Village Board approval as set
forth in division (B). In addition, in the case of conversion of an existing
non-electronic billboard to an electronic billboard, any previously approved
variations or special uses related to the existing non-electronic billboard
shall not be applicable to the electronic billboard. The Village President and
Board of Trustees may deny the placement of any electronic billboard where they
determine that the placement will be detrimental to the Village and its
residents based on any reason, including, but not limited to, aesthetic
reasons, brightness, driver distraction or other safety reasons, and proximity
to residential areas. The Village President and Board of Trustees may also deny
the placement of any electronic billboard where the application fails to meet
the standards set forth in this section.
   (C)   Notice of hearing. The party petitioning for placement shall give
notice of the public hearing addressed and provided via mailing or personal
delivery to the “owners/occupants” of all properties located within 250 feet of
the proposed billboard placement. The notice shall include the date, time,
location and purpose of the hearing, the name of the body holding the hearing,
the name of the applicant, and the address of the subject property on which the
billboard is proposed to be located. Notice shall be given no less than 15
days, but not more than 30 days, prior to the hearing date. The applicant shall
provide an affidavit to the Community Development Department stating that
notice was mailed or delivered to every property within 250 feet of the
proposed billboard placement site. The applicant shall also provide the
Community Development Department with a list of addresses and property
identification numbers (PINs) of all notice recipients.
   (D)   Conditions of approval. If a Village building permit(s) for
installation is required, the building permit issuance is contingent upon
approval of the billboard by the Village President and the Board of Trustees,
and confirmation from the Director of Community Development that the billboard
will comply with all applicable regulations. Approval is also conditioned upon
provision of proof that the applicant has adequate insurance coverage,
including comprehensive general liability insurance. The scope of insurance
coverage will be fixes by the Village based on the scope of the billboard
installation. The Village reserves the right to impose additional conditions of
approval dependent upon the proposed site, public hearing, expert consultant
review, and other factors relevant to protecting Village safety, health, and
aesthetics.
   (E)   Impact fee. Prior to the issuance of a Village building permit(s) for
installation of the billboard, the party petitioning for placement must deposit
an impact fee in an amount determined by the Village Board. This impact fee
shall be payable to the Village Board to distribute to certain Village
residents to mitigate or remediate the potential effects of light pollution and
glare. The amount will be based on estimated cost of remediation options and
the number of affected property owners.
   (F)   Limitation on Village approval of application and operation of
electronic billboard. Village authorization and approval to operate an
electronic billboard shall cease upon the earliest of the following: (1) the
owner/operator is no longer the record title owner of the billboard property;
(2) an applicable lease term expires or is deemed invalid due to a breach; or
(3) the electronic billboard ceases operation for a period of 60 consecutive
calendar days following commencement of operation, excluding any period of non-
operation due to demonstrated replacement, repair, and maintenance work. Upon
termination or cessation of operations, the billboard owner/operator shall
remove the billboard and related structures within 30 calendar days. If the
owner/operator fails to remove the billboard within 30 days, the Village may
institute the nuisance abatement procedures in accordance with §§

§ 155.01 CREATION AND PURPOSE.
   Pursuant to the Village's Home Rule authority, there is hereby established
in the Village an Adjacent Neighbors Land Acquisition Program (ANLAP Program).
The ANLAP Program will allow the Village to convey certain surplus parcels of
land to adjacent residential property owners for the purpose of returning such
parcels to the tax rolls of the Village and so that such parcels may be
maintained, beautified, and otherwise improved.
(Ord. C0-08-40, passed 9-16-2008)
§ 155.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a separate meaning.
   ADJACENT NEIGHBOR. An owner of record of an improved parcel of real property
immediately adjacent to a Village-owned parcel of vacant property and who is
not delinquent in the payment of any property taxes or any other debt owed to
the Village, as verified by the Village. Where non-standard parcels are
involved (corner parcel, parcel not facing onto a street, and the like), what
constitutes an adjacent  neighbor shall be in the sole discretion of the
Village Manager. It is the policy of the Village that ANLAP transactions not
create or further perpetuate irregular-shaped lots or flag lots.
   PARCEL. A parcel of vacant real property which is bounded on at least 1 side
by an improved parcel of residential zoned real property and which does not
meet the bulk regulations of the Village's zoning ordinance (such as the
requirements relative to minimum lot area and width).
(Ord. C0-08-40, passed 9-16-2008)
§ 155.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   The Director of Community Development or his or her designee shall be
responsible for the screening of applicants for the acquisition of property
under the ANLAP Program. The Director of Community Development or his or her
designee shall establish criteria, guidelines, and procedures for the screening
of adjacent neighbor applicants and shall recommend to the President and Board
of Trustees those applicants and parcels eligible for the ANLAP Program. The
Director of Community Development or his or her designee is authorized to
negotiate and execute, on behalf of the Village, all documents (other than
quitclaim deeds) as are required and necessary to accomplish the conveyance of
properties to approved adjacent neighbor applicants, subject to the review and
approval of the Village Attorney.
(Ord. C0-08-40, passed 9-16-2008)
§ 155.04 MAINTENANCE OF LIST.
   The Village shall maintain a list of Village-owned real property which shall
include those parcels available for sale under the ANLAP Program. This list
shall be made available to the public in the Village Clerk's office during
normal business hours.
(Ord. C0-08-40, passed 9-16-2008)
§ 155.05 BIDS AND PURCHASE.
   (A)   Purchase price. The minimum purchase price for a single parcel shall
be $500. Upon receipt of an offer by an adjacent neighbor to purchase a parcel,
the Village shall give written notice by certified mail to any other owner of
adjacent property indicating that the Village will accept sealed bids for the
parcel for a period of 30 days from the date of the mailing of the notice. All
bids that conform with the requirements of the ANLAP Program shall be submitted
to the President and Board of Trustees for consideration. The President and
Board of Trustees may, in their sole discretion, accept a particular bid or may
reject all bids. All bids must comply with the requirements of the ANLAP
Program. Acceptance of a bid and authorization for the sale of a parcel shall
be by approval of a resolution by a simple majority vote of the President and
Board of Trustees.
   (B)   Public utilities and easements. If public utilities, street lighting,
sanitary or storm sewers, fire hydrants and related water service lines, public
sidewalks or any other above or below grade infrastructure or public
improvements (the "public facilities") are located within any portion of the
parcel to be sold, the Village shall reserve in the quitclaim deed, a public
utility or sidewalk easement of sufficient size to accommodate the repair,
replacement, or maintenance of said public facilities or the installation of
additional public facilities. The Village Engineer, in his discretion, shall
determine the size of the required easement area. The quitclaim deed will not
remove or release any existing non-Village easement rights or other conditions
of public record that are enforceable by other persons or private or public
entities.
   (C)   Other costs.
      (1)   Following approval of the authorizing resolution, the adjacent
owner shall, within 30 days of such approval, deposit with the Village $1,500
to pay for the costs incurred by the Village in considering and processing the
offer and sale, including without limitation, the preparation of the quitclaim
deed, other conveyance documents and resolution approving said sale, plat of
consolidation, the mailing of notices required under this chapter, and any
filing or recording fees charged by the County Recorder of Deeds or any other
governmental agency. If the adjacent owner desires to obtain a title commitment
or policy, or to close the transaction at a title company, such title
commitment or policy and closing fees shall be at his or her sole cost.
      (2)   The adjacent neighbor remains obligated to pay the balance of the
total actual fees and costs incurred by the Village under the ANLAP Program
including any title commitment/policy or closing costs. The balance of any
deposit, after the actual incurred costs and fees are satisfied, shall be
promptly returned to the adjacent neighbor, at or following the closing.
      (3)   Once the deposit is received, the Village Engineer will evaluate
the parcel relative to the Village's need to retain certain types of easements
or the necessity to relocate any public facilities or to install a sidewalk in
the parcel. There may be public or private easements or conditions of title
that affect the parcel but if the adjacent neighbor desires to acquire the
parcel, he or she will take subject to such encumbrances. The Village Attorney
will deliver to the adjacent neighbor or to his or her attorney copies of the
title commitment, if any, and the Village Engineer's written recommendation
relative to the necessary easements or conditions that the Village will require
as part of the sale.
(Ord. C0-08-40, passed 9-16-2008)
§ 155.06 RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.
   (A)   Any sales contract and deed conveying a parcel to an adjacent neighbor
pursuant to the provisions of the ANLAP shall contain, at a minimum, covenants
which:
      (1)   Prohibit the adjacent neighbor from conveying, assigning or
otherwise transferring the parcel except in conjunction with the parcel owned
by the adjacent neighbor;
      (2)   Require the adjacent neighbor to maintain the parcel in accordance
with the provisions of the Village Code; and
      (3)   Provide that the parcel is being conveyed in "as is, where is
condition, including any environmental conditions existing in, on, or beneath
the property."
   (B)   The Village Board may require that other covenants be required that
are deemed to be in the public interest.
(Ord. C0-08-40, passed 9-16-2008)
§ 155.07 CONVEYANCE OF TITLE.
   Upon the approval of sale of a parcel by the President and Board of
Trustees, the title of such property shall be transferred to the adjacent
neighbor by issuance of a quitclaim deed by the Village, as grantor, to the
adjacent neighbor-purchaser, as grantee. Fee simple title to the property shall
be conveyed by the Village to the adjacent neighbor in "as is, where is
condition, including any environmental conditions existing in, on, or beneath
the property," and the quoted statement shall be included in the deed. The
President or his proxy are authorized to execute, and the Village Clerk
authorized to attest, quitclaim deeds conveying title to applicants upon
approval by the President and Board of Trustees. The Village, at the adjacent
neighbor's cost, shall record the deed with the office of the County Recorder
of Deeds within 30 days of the date of sale.
(Ord. C0-08-40, passed 9-16-2008)
§ 155.08 RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAXES.
   Subsequent to the date of sale and issuance of the quitclaim deed, the
adjacent neighbor will assume responsibility for all newly imposed real estate
taxes and any other state, county or Village fees, charges, taxes or
assessments applicable to the parcel. As part of the conveyance, the adjacent
neighbor shall execute any documents necessary to consolidate the parcel into
the adjacent improved parcel.

§ 157.04 PROCEDURE FOR FILING AN APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF A POLLUTION
CONTROL FACILITY.
   (A)   (1)   To request siting approval for a new PCF within the Village's
jurisdiction, an applicant must file an application with the Village Clerk,
with, unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees pursuant to
subdivision (2) below, a minimum of 25 copies of the application and the
substance of the applicant's proposal showing sufficient details describing the
proposed facility to demonstrate compliance with the Act and Board regulations,
including all site plans, engineering including calculations, exhibits and
maps, and all documents, if any, to be submitted to the IEPA as of the date of
filing the application. At a minimum, the application shall comply with the
rules and procedures. The form of the application may be obtained from the
Village Clerk.
      (2)   A simple majority of the Board of Trustees may, prior to receipt of
a particular request for site location approval hereunder, reduce the number of
copies of such request, or particular portions thereof, which must be submitted
under subsection (1). Such reductions may be granted upon the written motion of
a person who has, pursuant to Section 39.2(b) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/1 et
seq.), filed a notice of intent to submit an application for location approval,
which notice has also advised the recipients of the applicant's intention to
move for a copies reduction under this section. Such reductions motion must be
filed with the Cleric at least 5 calendar days prior to a regularly scheduled
Board of Trustees meeting. The moving party must submit a certified copy of the
notice of intent, and demonstrate that: compliance with the copies requirement
of subsection (1) will be inordinately expensive, without commensurate benefit
to the Village and the public; and that the proposed copies reduction will not
work any fundamental unfairness on the Village or the public, in their ability
to review, and prepare for the hearing on the location approval application.
The Board of Trustees shall act upon the motion expeditiously and may act upon
the request for copies reduction at its first regular meeting after filing of
the motion.
      (3)   (a)   In addition to the foregoing, the applicant shall deposit
with the Village Clerk at the time of filing the application for site approval
of a new PCF a filing fee deposit in the form of a certified or cashier's check
of $250,000, except that a filing fee deposit of $500,000 is required if the
proposed facility is designed as a hazardous waste disposal site or if the
disposal or volume reduction of any waste will be by incineration or burning.
In the event the applicant files an application for site approval of a waste
transfer station only, a reduced cost deposit in the amount of $100,000 must be
submitted to cover the costs as set forth below. If the applicant elects to
file an amended application for site location approval for any PCF in
accordance with this chapter, such filing shall be accompanied by payment of a
supplemental fee of $50,000.
         (b)   The applicable filing fee is intended to defray the reasonable
and necessary costs of processing the application, including, but not limited
to: costs of site inspection, clerical expenses, copying costs, space rental,
Hearing Officer compensation, court reporter expenses, transcription costs,
public notice expenses, Village Attorney and Village consultants (such as
qualified professional engineers, planners, appraisers, environmental counsel,
and the like) (including tests, exhibits, and testimony, if any, provided by
the consultants), and other relevant costs incident to the consideration of an
application, the costs incident to preparing the record for appeal, and the
cost of representing the Village on appeal in case of an appeal of a Board of
Trustees decision (the "Village costs"). If at anytime the funds deposited by
the applicant are reduced below $50,000, the applicant shall deposit an
additional $50,000.
         (c)   The applicant may satisfy its costs deposit obligations through
cash or a combination of cash and an irrevocable letter of credit issued to the
Village, provided that the amount of cash balance available to pay Village-
incurred costs shall never be less than $50,000. In the event that the cash
balance is less than $50,000, the Village shall be authorized to draw down the
letter of credit in the amount of $50,000 and place the proceeds in the cash
deposit account.
         (d)   If there are funds remaining in the filing fee deposit after
payment of the Village costs, such amount shall be refunded to the applicant
upon the final resolution of the application process (including appeals to the
Illinois Pollution Control Board, Appellate Court, Illinois Supreme Court,
federal courts, and administrative review in the courts, if any). Should the
Village incur any additional costs in excess of the applicable filing fee
deposit, the applicant shall bear any and all such additional costs and shall
promptly pay over such additional amount to the Village upon request or demand.
The application must be complete, with answers provided for each question on
the application form. The application must contain consecutively numbered pages
and it must be accompanied by all site plans, exhibits, maps and documents
required by this chapter and by the rules and procedures. The date that the
applicant files a complete application in proper from, together with the
applicable filing fee deposit, with the Village Clerk shall be considered the
official filing date for all time limit purposes. The application is not
effective unless the application is in strict compliance with this chapter, the
rules and procedures and with the Act (415 ILCS 5/1 et seq.). If upon review of
the application within 21 days of its submittal, it is determined by the
Village to be incomplete and not in strict conformance with the aforesaid, the
application is deemed not filed and the filing fee (less Village costs and
expenses) shall be returned to the applicant. Failure of the Village to reject
a request for site approval is not, and shall not be deemed, acceptance of the
form or substance of the request, and the applicant remains solely responsible
to demonstrate that the location approval criteria are all met. At any time
prior to completion by the applicant of the presentation of the applicant's
factual evidence and an opportunity for cross-questioning by the Hearing
Officer, Village representatives and any participants, the applicant may file
not more than 1 amended application upon payment of additional fees pursuant to
Section 39.2(k) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/1) and subsection (3) of this chapter.
Provided, however, that the time limitation for final action set forth in
Section 39.2(e) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/1) and § 157.07(B) of this chapter shall
be extended for an additional period of 90 days.
      (4)   In the event a host agreement has been entered into between the
Village and the applicant, fees and costs will be paid in accordance with the
host agreement in lieu of (3) above. If, prior to making a final local siting
decision, the Village has negotiated and entered into a host agreement with the
applicant, the terms and conditions of the host agreement, whether written or
oral, shall be disclosed and made a part of the hearing record for that local
siting proceeding. In the case of an oral agreement, the disclosure shall be
made in the form of a written summary jointly prepared and submitted by the
Village and the applicant and shall describe the terms and conditions of the
oral agreement.
   (B)   (1)   Upon receipt of a proper and complete application, and payment

Departments and is authorized to call interdepartment meetings for the purpose
of defining those reports and studies which are desired and for setting
deadlines for the submittal of reports and recommendations.
      (2)   The Village Manager may retain consultants on behalf of the Village
to develop a record sufficient to form the basis of an appeal of the Board of
Trustees's decision. The consultants and the Village agencies shall then
commence a study of the application. The applicant shall cooperate fully with
the consultants and the technical staff of the Village in their review of the
application, including providing access to the site for study or testing,
including but not limited to geophysical testing.
   (C)   A copy of the application and all related documents or other materials

   (D)   It is the applicant's duty to comply with all notice requirements set
forth in the Act. The applicant shall:
      (1)   No later than 14 days prior to filing an application for site
location approval with the Village Clerk, cause written notice of such
application to be served either in person or by registered mail, return receipt
requested, on the owners of all property within the subject area not solely

occupied by public roads, streets, alleys and other public ways shall be
excluded in computing the 250 feet requirement; provided further, that in no
event shall this requirement exceed 400 feet, including public streets, alleys
and other public ways.

   (E)   (1)   The public hearing shall develop a record sufficient to form the
basis of appeal of the decision in accordance with Section 40.1 of the Act (415

the area that it is intended to serve;
         (b)   That the facility is so designed, located, and proposed to be
operated that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected;
         (c)   That the facility is located so as to minimize incompatibility
with the character of the surrounding area and to minimize the effect on the
value of the surrounding property;
         (d)   For a facility other than a sanitary landfill or waste disposal

or that the site is floodproofed; for a facility that is a sanitary landfill or
waste disposal site, the facility is located outside the boundary of the 100-

admissibility of evidence or procedural issues at the public hearing shall be
appealable to the Board of Trustees. Issues of jurisdiction shall be finally
determined by the Board of Trustees.
   (G)   The applicant for site location approval shall have the burden of
proof and the burden of going forward with evidence. The testimonial evidence
introduced by the applicant may not exceed the scope of the application. Such
oral testimony may only explain and clarify the application, not expand or
amend the application.
   (H)   All persons desiring to be participants in the hearing, including
members of the public, must submit written notification of the intent to the
Village Clerk before the first day of the public hearing or register with the
Hearing Officer on the first day of the hearing. Any person so appearing at

Any such person shall have the right to be represented by an attorney at the
public hearing. Opportunity for any persons appearing at the public hearing to
cross-examine any witness may be reasonably limited in time and duration by the
Hearing Officer, to assure completion of the hearings in accordance with the
deadlines of the Act. The Hearing Officer may propound questions to any witness
or to the applicant to clarify the record established by the participants at

participant and a party to all proceedings and shall proceed last with its case
and cross-examination.
   (I)   The applicant and the Village's counsel shall be allowed to cross-
examine witnesses by right, subject to such reasonable limitation as may be set

exercise discretion in the manner in which such questions are to be posed to
witnesses. Sufficient examination of witnesses is to be allowed so as to
provide for fundamental fairness.
   (J)   All witnesses shall testify under oath. Testimony may include the use

reasonable examination as follows: direct, cross-examination, redirect, and
recross.
   (K)   The Hearing Officer may exercise discretion to allow public comment at
each hearing or may set one time for public comment.
   (L)   The Hearing Officer shall, in the Hearing Officer's discretion and to
the extent reasonably practicable, permit the Village, the applicant and any
party to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
   (M)   The Hearing Officer shall submit his/her report to the Board of
Trustees as soon as practicable, but in no event earlier than the end of the
30-day comment period.
   (N)   The siting approval procedures and criteria provided for in the Act
and in this chapter for new PCF's shall be the exclusive siting procedures and
rules and approval procedures. Local zoning or other local land use requirement
shall not be applicable to such siting decisions. However, to the extent
provided by law, the applicant shall also comply with zoning and other
requirements.
(Ord. C0-02-34, passed 11-13-2002)
§ 157.07 DECISIONS.
   (A)   Once the Hearing Officer has made his written report containing the
public record, the report shall be submitted to the Board of Trustees for its
decision as to the ultimate approval or disapproval of the proposed site
location. Five copies of the record of the public hearing shall also be made
available to the Board of Trustees as soon as the transcript becomes available.
   (B)   The Board of Trustees shall make a decision based on the record from
the public hearing. The decision of the Board of Trustees shall be by
resolution in writing, specifying the reasons for the decision, such reasons to
be in conformity with Section 39.2(a) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/1). In granting
site location approval, the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions as may
be reasonable and necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Act to the extent
that the conditions are not inconsistent with the Act and the regulations
promulgated by the Illinois Pollution Control Board. Such decisions shall be
available for public inspection at the office of the Village Clerk and may be
copied upon payment of the cost of reproduction. If there is no final action by
the Board of Trustees within 180 days after the filing of the application for
site location approval, the applicant may deem the application approved unless
the time for approval has been extended for an additional period of 90 days
pursuant to the Act and this chapter.
   (C)   An applicant may not file an application for site location approval
which is substantially the same as a request which was disapproved, pursuant to
a finding against the applicant under any criteria (a) through (i) of division
(E) above, and of Section 39.2(a) of the Act (415 ILCS 5/1), within 2 years.
   (D)   Siting approval obtained pursuant to this chapter is transferable and
may be transferred to a subsequent owner or operator. In the event that siting
approval has been transferred to a subsequent owner or operator, that
subsequent owner or operator assumes and takes subject to any and all
conditions imposed upon the prior owner or operator by the Village. However,
any such conditions imposed pursuant to this section may be modified by
agreement between the subsequent owner or operator and the Village. Further, in
the event that siting approval obtained pursuant to this section has been
transferred to a subsequent owner or operator, that subsequent owner or
operator assumes all rights and obligations and takes the facility subject to
any and all terms and conditions of any existing host agreement between the
prior owner or operator and the Village.
   (E)   A local siting approval granted under this section shall expire at the
end of 2 calendar years from the date upon which it was granted, unless the
local siting approval granted under this section is for a sanitary landfill
operation, in which case the approval shall expire at the end of 3 calendar
years from the date upon which it was granted, and unless within that period
the applicant has made application to the agency for a permit to develop the
site. In the event that the local siting decision has been appealed, such
expiration period shall be deemed to begin on the date upon which the appeal
process is concluded.
(Ord. C0-02-34, passed 11-13-2002)
§ 157.08 ADMINISTRATION OF FEES AND COSTS.
   (A)   All expenses incurred by the Village in managing or reviewing of the
request for site approval, conducting the public hearing, arriving at the site
approval decision, and any appeals from the Board of Trustees decision shall be

any and all additional costs within a reasonable time of presentment of a
statement from the Village Treasurer.

new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site environment;
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;

place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken;

historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved;
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity;
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, coter,
texture, and other visual qualities, and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence;

protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken;

shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment; and
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with its original
architectural style and character;

to approve or deny the application within 90 days, subject to the following: if
an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed
approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in writing of its
intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75 days after the
submission of a completed application. The permit shall be deemed approved on
the later of the 90th day after submission of the completed application, or the

120 days, subject to the following: if an applicant intends to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the
Village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no
sooner than 105 days after the submission of a completed application. The
permit shall be deemed approved on the later of the 120th day after submission
of the completed application, or the 10th day after receipt of the deemed
approved notice by the Village. Receipt of a deemed approved notice by the
Village shall not preclude the Village from denying the permit within the
allowed time limit.
   (F)   Tolling. The time limitations for approval or denial of applications
shall be tolled by notice to an applicant that its application is incomplete as
set forth above, upon mutual agreement of the parties, or by a local, state or
federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes a delay.
   (G)   Pole replacement. Permit approval shall be conditioned on the
replacement of a utility pole or wireless support structure at the applicant's
sole cost where such replacement is deemed necessary for compliance with the
requirements of this chapter or Code relative to the siting of small wireless
facilities, or other applicable codes and regulations that concern public
safety.
   (H)   Denial. The Village shall deny an application that does not meet the
requirements of this chapter. The reasons for any denial of a permit shall be
provided in a written notice of denial sent to the applicant, and shall include
the specific Code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based.
   (I)   Resubmittal after denial. In the case of a permit denial, an applicant
may cure the deficiencies identified in the notice of denial and resubmit a
revised application once within 30 days after the notice of denial is sent
without payment of an additional application fee. The Village shall have 30
days to approve or deny the resubmitted application or it is deemed approved if
the applicant has notified the Village of its intention to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which notification may be
submitted with the resubmitted application. Review of a resubmitted application
is limited to the deficiencies cited in the original notice of denial. This
section does not apply if a revised application is not resubmitted within 30
days, or curing any deficiencies in the original application requires review of
a new location, new or different structure for collocation, new antennas, or
other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. In such
cases, a new application and application fee are required.
   (J)   Consolidated applications. Consolidated applications for small
wireless facilities for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities
shall be allowed if the collocations each involve substantially the same type
of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. Each
consolidated application shall provide all the information required by this
chapter for each small wireless facility at each location. If such an
application includes incomplete information for 1 or more small wireless
facility collocations, or includes requests for small wireless facilities that
do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or that are otherwise denied, the
Village may remove such collocation requests from the application and treat
them as separate requests. Separate permits may be issued for each collocation
approved in a consolidated application.

§ 160.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Public safety technology. A wireless provider's operation of a small
wireless facility may not interfere with the frequencies used by a public
safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider must
install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause
unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications
equipment. Unacceptable interference is determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith
effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
Village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the
interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited
above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a
public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the
procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this code.
   (B)   A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any small wireless
facility that:
      (1)   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on
a right-of-way;
      (2)   Obstructs the legal use of right-of-way by utility users;
      (3)   Violates nondiscriminatory applicable codes;
      (4)   Violates or conflicts with Chapter 101 (Standards for Construction
of Utility Facilities on Public Rights-of-Way), or other applicable regulations
set forth in this code or otherwise adopted by the Village, except to the
extent such chapters, sections or regulations may be modified by the provisions
of this chapter; or
      (5)   Violates the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42
U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.)
   (C)   Contractual requirements. Wireless providers shall comply with all
requirements imposed by a contract between the Village and any private property
owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles

      (2)    A wireless provider may receive a waiver from the Building
Director or their designee to allow a small wireless facility to be located
above ground in an area where Village ordinances or regulations prohibit or
restrict above ground facilities if the wireless provider can establish that:
         (a)   Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is
no reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-
way;
         (b)   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area;
         (c)   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or constitute a safety
hazard;
         (d)   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies;
         (e)   Space exists within the public right-of-way to accommodate the
above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location;
         (f)   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not create a safety hazard;
         (g)   The above ground small wireless facility is located and designed
in such a way so as to minimize its visual impact on adjacent properties; and
         (h)   In any historical area, that the above ground small wireless
facility will not detrimentally affect the historical nature of the area.

facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened around the perimeter in
accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a professional landscape engineer.
Plant materials shall include a mixture of deciduous and coniferous planting
materials. The owner or wireless provider shall be responsible for maintenance
of all landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan.
      (4)   Future undergrounding. The Village may, from time to time, make a
decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the Village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small
wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the Village shall
either:
         (a)   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         (b)   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   (F)   Collocation limits.
      (1)   Wireless providers shall not collocate small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
      (2)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
      (3)   For purposes of this division, the terms COMMUNICATIONS
SPACE, COMMUNICATION WORK SAFETY ZONE, and ELECTRIC SUPPLY ZONE have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   (G)   Code compliance. Wireless providers shall comply with applicable codes
and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
