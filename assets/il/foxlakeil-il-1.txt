other electronic communication device, but only in compliance with the open
meetings act and this code. In the event of a conflict between the open
meetings act and this code, the open meetings act shall control.
      2.   Eligibility: If a quorum of the corporate authorities is physically
present as required by section 2.01 of the open meetings act, any trustee or
the mayor may attend the meeting by video or audio conference if such trustee
or the mayor is prevented from physically attending because of: a) personal
illness or disability; b) employment purposes or the business of the public
body; c) a family or other emergency. Audio or video conference attendance
shall be in accord with this section; or d) unexpected childcare obligations.

attend a meeting by video or audio conference, the member must notify the
village clerk before the meeting. The clerk or his or her designee, after
receiving the request, shall inform the mayor and village board of the request
for electronic attendance. If a majority of the members of the Village Board
approve, the request for electronic attendance shall be approved.

clerk, and the public in physical attendance. The telephonic connection shall
be of sufficient quality to carry uninterrupted audio of the meeting.
      5.   Determination Of Mayor Or Temporary Chairman: The mayor (if
physically present), or duly elected temporary chairman of the meeting, may
refuse to allow a member to attend by video or audio conference if he or she
determines that the audio standards set forth above cannot be met. The mayor or
temporary chairman shall make such determination as a matter of record and
direct the clerk or recording secretary note such determination in the minutes

motion passed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members physically
present.

will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to.
Accordingly, although the mayor cannot chair the meeting, the mayor may break a
tie or vote when statutorily permitted when attending electronically. The
member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as to
any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically
shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded

   A.   Mayor Or Mayor Pro Tem: The Mayor shall not vote on any ordinance,
resolution or motion except: 1) where the vote of the Board has resulted in a
tie; 2) where one-half (1/2) of the elected Trustees have voted in favor of an
ordinance, resolution or motion even though there is no tie vote; or 3) where a
vote greater than a majority of the Trustees is required by law to adopt an
ordinance, resolution or motion. In each instance specified, the Mayor shall
vote. Nothing in this subsection shall deprive a Mayor Pro Tem from voting in
his capacity as Trustee, but he shall not be entitled to another vote in his
capacity as Mayor Pro Tem. (1975 Code § 2.05)
   B.   Veto: All resolutions, motions and ordinances specified in subsection A
of this section which are approved by the Mayor shall be signed by him. Those
of which he disapproves, he shall return to the Board, with his written
objection, at the next regular meeting occurring not less than five (5) days
after their passage. The Mayor may disapprove of any one (1) or more sums
budgeted in any ordinance, resolution or motion budgeting funds, and if so, the
remainder shall be effective. If the Mayor fails to return an ordinance or any
specified resolution with his written objections within the designated time, it
shall become effective despite the absence of his signature. (Ord. 2014-36, 11-
25-2014)
   C.   Passing Over Veto: Every ordinance, resolution and motion which is
returned to the Board by the Mayor, shall be reconsidered by the Board. If,

be recorded in the journal. (1975 Code § 2.05)

   E.   Consent Agenda: The Clerk or the Deputy Clerk of the Village, in
preparing the agenda for council meetings may include regular, recurring or
routine matters under the heading "consent agenda". No item requiring more than
a simple majority vote shall be placed on a consent agenda. The consent agenda
shall be established in the following manner: The Corporate Authorities at any
meeting may, by unanimous consent, take a single vote by "yeas" and "nays" on
the several questions of the passage of any two (2) or more of the designated
ordinances, orders, resolutions, or motions placed together for voting purposes
in a single group. The single vote shall be entered separately in the journal
under the designation "omnibus vote", and in that event the Clerk may enter the
words "omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal in each case instead of
entering the names of the members of City Council voting in "yeas" and those
voting in "nays" on the passage of each designated ordinance, order, resolution
and motion included in the omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of a
single or omnibus vote and the entries of the words "omnibus vote" or "consent
agenda" in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance with the requirements
of this section to all intents and purposes and with like effect as if the vote
in each case had been taken separately by "yeas" and "nays" on the question of
the passage of each ordinance, order, resolution, and motion included in the
omnibus group and separately recorded in the journal. Likewise the "yeas" and
"nays" shall be taken upon the question of the passage of any other resolution
or motion at the request of any Alderman and shall be recorded in the journal.

shall be as follows:
         a.   Completed application packet shall be filed with the community
development department. Applications shall not be deemed to be complete unless
all required documentation is provided, including, but not limited to, a
preliminary design sketch, a description of needed work items and three (3)
third party estimates of the cost of the anticipated work. In addition the
applicant should indicate which bid they are approving and provide the signed
executed agreements. If work to be completed by owner, paid receipts needed for
materials only.
         b.   After receipt of completed application, the Director of Community
and Economic Development shall meet with the applicant to review the
application. At the conclusion of said meeting (or continued meeting date if
the application is deemed incomplete), the Director of Community and Economic
Development shall determine whether the application is eligible for a grant.
The application may be amended on its face to meet concerns or suggestions of
the Director of Community and Economic Development. The decision shall be
submitted in writing to the applicant and to the president and board of
trustees at the next regularly scheduled village board meeting.
         c.   If the Director of Community and Economic Development finds the
applicant to be ineligible for a grant and the applicant notifies the Director
of Community and Economic Development that the applicant desires to appeal the
decision of ineligibility within seven (7) days after the decision in writing
is issued, then copies of the application shall be furnished by the Director of
Community and Economic Development to the village board and the village board
shall consider the application at its next meeting on which the application can
be placed on the agenda and shall either vote to find the application eligible,
find the application ineligible, or request further information from either the
applicant or Director of Community and Economic Development. If further
information is provided, the village board shall vote promptly thereafter, and
the decision of the village board shall be final. Nothing herein shall prevent
the applicant from withdrawing the application prior to a decision by the
village board.
         d.   Application for reimbursement shall be submitted along with

development department. Neither the community development department nor the

are necessary for any improvements.
         f.   Any changes to approved plans or drawings must be approved by the
Director of Community and Economic Development prior to being made. The amount

codes.

within six (6) months after approval by the village board of the application.
Extension of three (3) months may be granted by village board approval only.
The community development department will send notice thirty (30) days prior to

the petitioner needs to contact the community development department if they
wish to ask the village board for an extension. Should the petitioner not apply
within a thirty (30) day period after the six (6) month expiration, the grant
will be forfeited back to the village. Following completion of the work, the
village community development department will inspect the work for conformance
with the approved plans and drawings and compliance with village codes. Any
business found to be in violation of any village code or ordinance or be in
arrears of any payments or having outstanding debt to the village shall not be
eligible for participation in this program until all violations are corrected
and payments made. If a business applies for and is awarded a grant and at a
later date declines the funding, the owner must do so in writing so that the
village has a record of the refusal of funds.
         i.   Any and all applications for payment shall be submitted to the
village within one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of the work. No
amounts shall be approved for payment in excess of the village’s portion of the
preliminary cost estimate submitted with the application, and no check shall be
issued by the village unless the applicant and contractor have acknowledged in
writing that the work is complete, applicant has paid applicant’s portion of
the cost of the work, and final waivers of lien are delivered to the village
for all labor and materials supplied to complete the work. If a payment
application is not made within that time, or if the work is not completed
within six (6) months after village board approval of the application, then the
village will not make payment for the improvements for which the application
was previously approved.
      5.   Funding: Each fiscal year the village shall appropriate or budget
such funds as are deemed appropriate for providing grants described herein.
Only such funds as have been appropriated or budgeted shall be disbursed. When
grant applications have been approved totaling the approximate appropriated or
budgeted amount for any fiscal period, then additional applications shall be
accepted but shall not be acted upon until the beginning of the next fiscal
year. Also, any applications which have not been approved at the time the
budgeted amount has been achieved may proceed through the approval process but

1-12-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The general purpose of this chapter is to establish the process by
which an individual can apply for health insurance benefits pursuant to PSEBA
and is intended to provide a fair and efficient method of determining the
eligibility of a full-time village of Fox Lake police officers to the benefits
enumerated under the Act through an administrative process, including if
necessary, an administrative hearing. All benefits provided to employees
pursuant to PSEBA shall be consistent with the Act.
   B.   The administrative procedure established herein recognizes the
village's obligations under PSEBA to provide health insurance benefits to
eligible individuals as provided under PSEBA, who qualify for, and are
determined to be eligible to receive, certain health insurance benefits from
the village. This administrative procedure is not a contract that bestows a
benefit or entitlement on any particular individual and may be modified by the
village at any time without notice.
   C.   Any full-time village police officer who, after the effective date of
PSEBA, suffers a catastrophic injury or is killed in the line of duty, and
which injury or death occurred as the result of the officer's response to fresh
pursuit, the officer's response to what is reasonably believed to be an
emergency, an unlawful act perpetrated by another, or during the investigation
of a criminal act, may apply for health insurance benefits under PSEBA as set
forth in this chapter. The same benefits may be extended to the spouse and
eligible dependent children of the catastrophically injured or deceased public
safety employee, provided the conditions as established by PSEBA are met. (Ord.
2020-20, 9-22-2020)
1-12-2: APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
A PSEBA application shall be filed by a PSEBA applicant no later than thirty
(30) days from the date a permanent line-of-duty disability pension claim is
awarded. Any police chief who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Police
or Fire Pension Board shall submit a completed PSEBA application within six (6)
months of sustaining the alleged catastrophic injury.
The Village Administrator shall provide the applicant with a copy of this
section at the time the PSEBA application is provided.
   A.   The application shall include the name of the employee; the full name
of the applicant's spouse, date of marriage, with marriage license attached;
birth certificates or adoption orders for all dependent children, and any and
all other documents establishing that the child is "dependent" as set forth in
the village's health insurance plan document; the date of hire; detailed
information regarding the incident including date, time, place and nature of
injury, and any other factual circumstances surrounding the incident giving
rise to said claim; the identities of witnesses to the incident, the names of
witnesses the applicant may call at a PSEBA hearing and the names and addresses
of the employee's medical providers; information and supporting documentation
filed with the Pension Board by the applicant and all exhibits on file with the
Pension Board; any and all rulings or determinations by the Pension Board; any
and all documents supporting the PSEBA eligibility requirement for applicant's
beneficiaries, including: proof of active school enrollment and employment.
Failure to file a fully complete application, along with submittal of all
supporting documents, shall result in a forfeiture of PSEBA benefits until the
next date of open enrollment for the insurance.
   B.   Medical Release Required: Medical records shall be secured by the
village. Medical releases provided by the Village Administrator authorizing the
collection of medical information by the village related to the injury
incident, including, but not limited to, disability pension proceedings,
worker's compensation records and medical records shall be signed by the
applicant and timely submitted with the PSEBA application. The PSEBA medical
release shall specify the name, address, email and phone information for all
pertinent health care providers and hospitals, along with the employee's
signature and a witness's signature. The release shall comply with HIPAA
standards. Medical records shall be considered "supporting documents" as
required above.
   C.   Additional Information: The Human Resources Department shall, at any
time, have the authority to modify the PSEBA application, or seek additional
information from an applicant, to better enable the village to ascertain the
applicant's qualifications.
   D.   No Review Until Complete Application Filed: The village's initial
review of the PSEBA application will not occur until all of the required
information, including the supporting documents, are submitted to the Human
Resources Department.
   E.   Sworn Application: Any application for PSEBA benefits shall be sworn to
by the applicant and notarized. All supporting documents filed for PSEBA
qualification shall be verified under oath by the applicant and notarized.

1-12-3: APPLICATION REVIEW BY THE HUMAN RESOURCES    DEPARTMENT AND/OR VILLAGE
ADMINISTRATOR:
Upon receipt of a timely fully completed PSEBA application filed, the village's
Human Resources Department will review the application form and associated
materials in order to determine whether the applicant is eligible for PSEBA
benefits. If Human Resources staff members decide that additional information
is necessary in order to render a decision, staff members may schedule an
informal meeting with the applicant and/or the applicant's representative.
Alternatively, Human Resources staff members may schedule a formal fact-finding
hearing pursuant to the procedures outlined in section
1-12-5  below. Human Resources staff members also may consult with other
individuals and/or resources as they deem appropriate.
   A.   HR Recommendation for PSEBA Benefits: In the event the Human Resources
Department concludes without a fact-finding hearing that the applicant is
entitled to PSEBA benefits, staff members will submit a recommendation for such
benefits to the Village Administrator.
   B.   PSEBA Approval: If the Village Administrator determines that all PSEBA
requirements have been satisfied, the Village Administrator may grant the PSEBA
benefits. Upon such grant, the applicant will be notified and required to
contact the Human Resources Department within thirty (30) calendar days for
benefit explanation and processing.
   C.   PSEBA Fact-Finding: If the Village Administrator does not approve the
application or decides that additional fact-gathering is necessary, the Village
Administrator may schedule a fact-finding hearing pursuant to the procedures
outlined in section
1-12-5  below.

and/or the Village Administrator conclude that a fact-finding hearing is
necessary in order to determine whether an applicant is eligible for PSEBA
benefits, the Village Administrator will appoint an Administrative Hearing
Officer within thirty (30) days of the request. The Administrative Hearing
Officer shall set the first date of the administrative hearing within thirty
(30) calendar days of being appointed. (Ord. 2020-20, 9-22-2020; amd. Ord.

the Administrative Hearing Officer, but the Administrative Hearing Officer
shall state on the record the reason for that determination.

than five (5) business days from that source becoming available to the
applicant or the applicant's beneficiaries.
   B.   Disclosure of Health Insurance Coverage: The applicant has an on-going
obligation and shall update health insurance coverage information provided and
failure to do so may result in the denial of benefits and/or reimbursement to
the village for duplicate coverage. If duplicate coverage has been received by
a PSEBA beneficiary, further PSEBA benefits will be denied until the village
has been fully reimbursed by the PSEBA beneficiary for what it would have been
credited if it had known about other coverage.
   C.   Reimbursement: Receipt of health insurance benefits from other sources
without notice to the village shall require the applicant to reimburse the
village for the value of those benefits.

a nationally recognized securities market.
This section does not prohibit any person serving on a village advisory panel

contract, work, or business of the village unless the officer's duties include
evaluating, recommending, approving, or voting to recommend or approve the
contract, work, or business.

hundred dollars ($1,500.00) (but the contract may be awarded without bidding if
the amount is less than $1,500.00); and
         f.   The award of the contract would not cause the aggregate amount of
all contracts so awarded to the same person, firm, association, partnership,
corporation, or cooperative association in the same fiscal year to exceed
twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).
      2.   If:

         b.   The amount of the contract does not exceed two thousand dollars
($2,000.00);
         c.   The award of the contract would not cause the aggregate amount of

quorum.
   C.   A contract for the procurement of public utility services by the
village with a public utility company is not barred by this section by one or
more members of the governing body being an officer or employee of the public
utility company, or holding an ownership interest in no more than seven and
one-half percent (71/2%) in the public utility company, and the public
utility's rates are approved by the Illinois commerce commission.
   D.   An officer who violates this section shall forfeit his or her office,
and upon conviction of such officer, his or her office shall become vacant.
   E.   Nothing contained in this section, including the restrictions set forth
in subsections B and C of this section, shall preclude a contract of deposit of
monies, loans, or other financial services by the village with a local bank or
local savings and loan association, regardless of whether a member of the
governing body of the village is interested in the bank or savings and loan
association as an officer or employee or as a holder of less than seven and
one-half percent (71/2%) of the total ownership interest. An officer holding an
interest described in this subsection in a contract does not hold a prohibited
interest for purposes of this act. The interested member of the governing body
must publicly state the nature and extent of the interest during deliberations
concerning the proposed award of the contract but shall not participate in any
further deliberations concerning the proposed award. The interested member
shall not vote on the proposed award. A member abstaining from participation in
deliberations and voting under this section may be considered present for
purposes of establishing a quorum. Award of the contract shall require approval
by a majority vote of those members presently holding office. Consideration and
award of a contract in which a member is interested may only be made at a
regularly scheduled public meeting of the governing body of the village. (Ord.

license renewal, where an investigation or inspection is required by ordinance
before the issuance of such permit or license, or where an inspection or
investigation shall be deemed reasonably necessary or appropriate, the village
clerk, within forty eight (48) hours of such receipt, shall refer the
application to the appropriate official(s) for the making of such investigation
or inspection.
   B.   The officials to whom the application has been referred shall make a
report thereon, favorable or otherwise, within ten (10) days after receiving
such application or a copy thereof.
   C.   The Lake County health department shall make or cause to be made an
inspection regarding such permits and licenses as relate to the care and
handling of food, the prevention of nuisances and the spread of disease, and
the protection of health. The building department shall make or cause to be
made any inspections which relate to compliance with the building code, zoning
ordinance, and other related regulations. All other investigations, except
where otherwise provided, shall be made by the chief of police, the chief of
the fire department, the superintendent of the water and sewer department and
the finance department, or by some other person designated by the village
president.
   D.   If, after due consideration of the information contained in the
application and the related investigated reports, the village clerk shall
determine that the application is satisfactory, the village clerk shall approve
the application. The applicant will be promptly notified that his application
is approved, and the license or permit may be issued.
   E.   If it shall appear to the village clerk that the matters and
circumstances relating to an application require further information before a
proper determination can be made, such application shall be returned to the
applicant for the inclusion of such additional information as may be specified
necessary and appropriate.
   F.   If, after due consideration of the information contained within the
application and the related investigated reports, the village clerk shall
determine that the matters concerning the application are unsatisfactory, the

of expiration of the license held by the licensee (if an annual) three (3)
weeks prior to the date of such expiration. Provided, however, that a failure

not excuse the licensee from the obligation to obtain a new license, or a
renewal thereof, nor shall it be a defense in an action based upon operation
without a license.

fails to obtain a license before May 1 of any year, the licensee shall pay to
the village treasurer prior to the time the current license is issued, a sum
equal to twice the normal license fee, it being determined by the corporate
authorities that such a charge is a reasonable and proper charge to offset the
costs to be incurred by the village in maintaining records and sending
delinquency notices for a license applicant who is late in securing a current
license. In the event a licensee who has been licensed the previous year fails
to obtain a license before June 1 of any year, a citation may be issued by the

otherwise provided, all license and permit fees shall become a part of the
corporate fund. In no event shall any rebate or refund be made of any license
or permit fee, or part thereof, by reason of death or departure of the licensee
or permittee; nor shall any rebate or refund be made by reason of nonuse of the

establishment, business, or activity. (Ord. 94-13, 6-6-1994)

Submittal and Process for Temporary Outdoor Dining and make it available to all
restaurants in the Village and members of the general public.
      2.   Any restaurant business that desires to open with temporary outdoor
seating shall be required to obtain and sign said permit and agree to be bound
by the terms thereof.
      3.   No permit fee shall be charged for said permit.

         b.   Duty To Provide Refuse Containers: The occupant of every
building, structure, or premises used or maintained in connection with any

Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/1-3.25. Alcoholic liquors on such licensed
premises may be sold by the drink for consumption upon the premises only.

patrons full and complete meals, including a dinner menu; 3) in which the food
preparation and service are not primarily operated as a fast food restaurant;

liquor on the licensed premises with no restrictions on the type of liquor
served provided, however, a separate dining area, exclusive of the bar area,

percent (50%) gross revenue standard has been met shall be made at the time of

percent (50%) standard has been met shall include, but not be limited to,
audited financial statements, corporate financial reports, tax return
information, state liquor license reports, or any other form of information
deemed acceptable by the village.
         c.   Class A-2(b) Minor Restaurants: A maximum of seven (7) licenses

their patrons full and complete meals, including a dinner menu; or 3) in which

restaurants. Alcoholic liquors on such licensed premises may be sold by the
drink for consumption upon the premises only. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
minor restaurant may sell wine by the bottle for consumption on or off the
premises, provided that, if wine is sold by the bottle for consumption on the
premises and it is not finished, the bottle with its remaining contents must be

4-2-3: SALE OF HARMFUL MATERIALS:
   A.   Elements Of The Offense: A person who, with knowledge that a person is
a child, is a person under eighteen (18) years of age, or who fails to exercise
reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly distributes
to or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to, or offers to distribute or
exhibit any harmful material to a child, is guilty of violating this section.
   B.   Definitions: Material is harmful if, to the average person applying
contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to
prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or
excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such matters, and is material, the redeeming
social importance of which, is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
   DISTRIBUTE: To transfer possession of, whether with or without
consideration.
   KNOWINGLY: Having knowledge of the contents of the subject matter, or
recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed
the contents thereof.

embodiment.
   C.   Interpretation Of Evidence:
      1.   The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall be
judged with reference to average children of the same general age of the child
to whom such material was offered, distributed, sent or exhibited, unless it
appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its
dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designated for specially
susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal of the material shall
be judged with reference to its intended or probable recipient group.
      2.   In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of
production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity
indicate the material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its
prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the
material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of
the material is in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal. (Ord. 79-
30, 12-17-1979)

         b.   The offender and the public would be best served if the offender

disposition of supervision shall be deemed without adjudication of guilt and
shall not be termed a conviction for purposes of disqualification or
disabilities imposed by law for conviction of a misdemeanor.

acting in the course of his or her official duties shall be liable for any
tortious acts of any person placed on supervision who is given any public

4-3-1: TITLE:
This chapter shall be known and cited as the ANIMAL CONTROL REGULATIONS of the
village. (Ord. 98-48, 8-3-1998)
4-3-2: POLICY AND PURPOSE:
The village board of trustees has made the following findings:
   A.   Animals that are not controlled by responsible owners become a hazard
to public health and safety.
   B.   Rabies is epidemic in wildlife and Lake and McHenry Counties, and
rabies vaccination of dog and cat pets is an important barrier to preventing an
epidemic of the disease in pets and thereby preventing a potential disease
problem in the village.
   C.   Registration provides an important means of identifying owners of
biting animals and thereby establishes responsibilities for fourteen (14) day
quarantines.
   D.   Overcrowding of animals on any premises in the village creates nuisance

   A.   Statute Authority: The Village may levy such taxes as are permitted by
65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-19-4 as heretofore and hereinafter amended,
to pay the cost of collection or disposal of garbage. Said tax shall be in
addition to the amounts levied for general purposes as provided by 65 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/11-19-4.
   B.   Service Charge:
      1.   Service Charge Established:
         a.   Pursuant to 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-19-4 and 5/11-19-
5, the Corporate Authorities of this Village are authorized to finance the
establishment and maintenance of systems or plants, by contract or by direct
provision, for the collection and disposal, treatment or recycling of garbage,
refuse, ashes and recycling by service charges to be collected from persons
receiving service, and are further authorized to provide for an exclusive
method for the disposition of garbage, refuse, ashes and recycling within the
Village.
         b.   In order to establish service charges which can reasonably be
expected to yield revenues not in excess of contract obligations and the costs
of operation, maintenance, and an adequate Depreciation Fund for the collection
and disposal of garbage, refuse, ashes, recycling, and toters (containers)
provided at no additional fee by the contractor for refuse and recycling, it is
necessary to assess a service charge of twenty-six dollars and eighty-two cents
($26.82) for all single-family residential units and multi-family residential
units with curbside individual container service, and multi-family residential
units with dumpster-style container service deemed non-commercial use by the
Village, plus a sixty-two cent ($0.62) per month administrative fee; to be
billed at regular intervals for all residents receiving service as aforesaid,
effective with billing dates beginning November 1, 2024. Thereafter service
charges shall be increased by five percent (5%) per year in accordance with the
Village's contract for garbage collection with Waste Management of Illinois,
Inc. through October 31, 2029.
         c.   In order to enable the Village to avail itself of bargaining
power in negotiating contracts for garbage removal on behalf of its residents,
the Village hereby ordains that the exclusive method for disposition of
garbage, refuse, ashes and recycling available to residents of the Village
shall be through the garbage hauler with whom the Village has a pending
contract from time to time. Effective November 1, 2024, all residents of Fox
Lake are required to use the refuse and recycling services as mandated in the

      2.   Payment Of Bills: Delinquencies: Except as hereinafter provided,
from and after the effective date of this chapter, all persons receiving
service for the collection and disposal of garbage, refuse, ashes and recycling
within the corporate limits of the Village shall pay a monthly charge to the
Village as set forth in subsection B.1.b. of this section, said charge to be
billed on a bimonthly basis (every two (2) months). Such bills shall be deemed
delinquent if not paid within thirty (30) days of billing date and an
additional ten percent (10%) shall be added to such delinquent balance. In the
event the bill for collection and disposal of garbage, refuse, ashes, and
recycling including any delinquency charge then due is not paid within sixty
(60) days after the billing date, then an additional ten percent (10%)
delinquency charge shall be added to the delinquent balance. If, after written
notice from the Village that a charge is delinquent, a user fails to make
payment of such charge and delinquency charge within ten (10) days thereafter,
the Corporate Authorities may undertake such legal proceedings as are required
to enforce collection, in which event such user shall also reimburse the
Village for all costs, sheriff fees, attorney fees and other expenses as are
incurred to enforce collection as aforesaid.
      3.   Service Charge Schedule: Each resident within the corporate limits
of the Village and subject to the monthly service charge, shall be furnished a

Fox Lake has entered into an agreement with Waste Management of Illinois, Inc.
to furnish all residents with suitable refuse and recycling toters
(receptables), which are included in the overall cost of their service.
   B.   No containers or refuse or recycling of any kind shall be deposited in

recycling shall be so placed that it can be blown about or scattered by the
wind.
   C.   It shall be the duty of every owner or occupant of any premises to
place such receptacles or cause them to be placed out of view of a person
facing the front of said premises; provided, however, such receptacles may be
placed on the parkway no more than twenty-four (24) hours prior to garbage
pick-up and such receptacles shall be removed therefrom within twenty-four (24)
hours after the garbage has been picked up.
   D.   In multiple-family, business and commercial districts where receptacles
of a larger capacity are necessary, commercial containers or dumpsters shall be
used, and the following conditions shall be maintained by every owner and
occupant of any premises in such districts:
      1.   Commercial containers or dumpsters must be of sufficient capacity to
contain all garbage between pick-ups.
      2.   Commercial containers or dumpsters must be covered with close-

of the sight of the general public, a solid gate shall be provided. Enclosures
shall be maintained in good order and free from excess garbage and debris.
   E.   Every dwelling unit shall have containers in numbers to hold all

fees may be waived in whole or in part by a majority vote of the Village Board

and classified by either the Federal, State or Municipal government authority
as a historic building or structure. Nothing herein shall constitute a waiver
of any other Village Code or Building Code provision requiring the complete
submission of professional architectural and engineering plans and
specifications and nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted as a waiver
of those Village requirements concerned with public health, safety and welfare
regarding any proposed construction, alteration, repair, enlargement and
relocation of buildings or structures.
   F.   Security Fund:
      1.   In addition to any other fees required herein, prior to issuance of
a building permit for new construction, the permittee shall establish a cash
security fund in an amount as set forth in this subsection. The security fund
shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this subsection at the
permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized
under the permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:
         a.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
hereof;
         b.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village
occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued
pursuant hereto;
         c.   Reimbursement to the village for any and all engineering fees,
attorney fees or other out of pocket consultant fees paid by the village in
conjunction with the permit or the work to be performed pursuant to the permit;
         d.   For purposes of Section
6-1-4 herein, new construction shall include construction of any building,
building addition, or any construction activity that includes heavy machinery
for grading or similar site work.
      2.   The amount of the security fund shall be a minimum of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) and shall be roughly equal to one percent (1%) of the
building commissioner's estimated cost of the improvements, unless the building
commissioner determines that costs of village consultants will exceed one
percent (1%) of the estimated cost of improvements, in which event the building
commissioner will identify the required amount.
      3.   The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice stating
the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this
subsection F.3., may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
         a.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
         b.   Fails to pay consultant costs incurred by the village and related
to the permit or work to be performed pursuant to the permit;
         c.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
         d.   Fails to comply with any provision hereof that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
      4.   Within ten (10) days after written notice from the village that any
amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore
the security fund to the amount specified in subsection F.2. of this section.
If the permittee fails to so replenish the security fund, then the building
commissioner may suspend the building permit and order that work on the
improvement cease until such time as replenishment occurs. If replenishment
does not occur within ninety (90) days after written notice specified above,
the building commissioner may revoke the building permit.
      5.   Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion
thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken
for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the
permittee to comply with any provisions hereof or other applicable law, but no
later than sixty (60) days after completion of the work described in the
permit. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund shall
become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any
reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said
revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage
shall be refunded to the permittee at such times as all such costs, loss or
damage have been ascertained and analyzed. No interest shall be due to
permittee for funds maintained in any security fund.
      6.   The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund
are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved hereby or
otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right
with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may
have.

Fox Lake, as obligee; conditioned that the contractors shall faithfully perform
the duties and in all things comply with all applicable building codes adopted
by the village of Fox Lake, including all amendments thereto pertaining to the
license or permit applied for. The total liability for the surety for all
claims, regardless of the number of claims made against the bond or the number
of years the bond remains in force, shall in no event exceed the amount of the
bond. Any revision of the bond amount shall not be cumulative. The surety shall
not be liable for any punitive damages or civil or criminal penalties which may
be assessed against the principal. The bond may be terminated at any time by
the surety by sending notice in writing to the obligee and to the principal by
first class U.S. mail and at the expiration of thirty (30) days from the
mailing of said notice, the bond shall terminate and the surety shall be
relieved from any further liability for any acts or omissions of the principals
subsequent to that date, but not for claims made on the bond prior to the date
of termination. At the discretion of the Building Commissioner, the requirement
of a surety bond may be imposed for projects less than twenty thousand dollars
($20,000.00) in value, if special circumstances exist to support the need for
such a bond. (Ord. 2020-21, 9-22-2020; amd. Ord. 2022-36, 7-26-2022; Ord. 2025-

6-2-2: UNSAFE OR UNFIT BUILDINGS 1 :
   A.   Determination; Declaration: Whenever in the opinion of the building
commissioner, there are reasonable grounds to believe that any building is so
damaged, decayed, dilapidated, unsanitary, unsafe or vermin infested that it
creates a serious hazard to the health or safety of the occupants, if any, to
persons who might enter therein or to the public in general, he shall declare
such building unfit for human habitation and shall so placard the building. In
determining whether or not a building is unfit for human habitation under this
section, existence of any one of the following conditions shall be sufficient
of itself to render the building so unfit:
      1.   The interior or exterior bearing walls or other vertical structural
members listed, lean or buckle to such an extent as to weaken the structural
support they are intended to provide.
      2.   Thirty three percent (33%) or more damage or deterioration of the
supporting member or members.
      3.   Fifty percent (50%) or more damage or deterioration of the
nonsupporting, enclosing or outside walls or covering.
      4.   Deterioration or damage by fire, wind or other causes so as to no
longer provide shelter from the elements.
      5.   Overloads or improperly distributed loads upon the floors or roof or
insufficient strength for the use made of such building.
      6.   Parts which are so attached that they may fall and injure occupants
or other persons on or about the premises. (1975 Code § 11.08)
   B.   Vacating Unfit Premises:
      1.   Any building or dwelling unit determined to be unfit for human
habitation and so designated and placarded by the building commissioner shall
be vacated within a reasonable time as ordered by the building commissioner
which time for vacation shall be set out in the placard.
      2.   After expiration of the vacation date set out in the placard, no
person shall occupy or let for occupancy any building or dwelling unit which
has been determined to be unfit for human habitation and has been so placarded,
until written approval of occupancy has been obtained from the building
commissioner and the placard has been removed by the building commissioner. The
building commissioner shall issue his approval and remove such placard whenever
in his opinion the defects or violations have been remedied, removed or
corrected and such building or dwelling unit complies in all respects with the
requirements of this chapter.
   C.   Entry, Approval: After expiration of the vacation date set out in the
placard, no person shall enter into or upon any dwelling unit or building
determined as unfit for human habitation and so placarded unless such entry is
with the written approval of the building commissioner and is exclusively in
connection with the repair, remodeling, renovation or removal of the unit or

certificate holder or any occupant of the rental dwelling that the rental
dwelling is free from all violations of all applicable property maintenance
laws, ordinances, or regulations. Nothing in this section

of the dangerous and unsafe building, or uncompleted and abandoned building
within the Village limits. (1975 Code §15.20)
6-4-2: LEGAL PROCEDURE:
The resolution shall direct the Village legal counsel to serve, at least
fifteen (15) days prior to any court action, a written notice by mail upon the
owner or owners thereof, including the lienholders of record, putting them on
notice to place said building in a safe condition or to demolish it, and that
their failure to do so will result in the filing of a law suit.
Upon failure of the owners to put such building in a safe condition or to
demolish it, the Village legal counsel shall apply to the circuit court in the
county in which such building is located for an order authorizing the
demolition or repair of said dangerous and unsafe building or uncompleted and
abandoned building. It shall not be a defense to such cause of action that the
building is boarded up or otherwise enclosed. (1975 Code §15.21; amd. Ord., 11-
17-75)
Whereupon diligent search, the identity or whereabouts of the owner or owners
of any such building including the lienholders of record is not ascertainable,
notice mailed to the person or persons in whose name such real estate was last
assessed is sufficient notice. (1975 Code §15.21)

days after such repair or demolition, the Village having incurred such costs
and expenses shall file notice of lien of such costs and expense incurred in

located. Notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting out (1) a
description of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof; (2) the
amount of money representing the costs and expenses incurred; and (3) the date
or dates when the costs and expense were incurred by the Municipality. (1975

   B.   Release of Lien: Upon payment of the costs and expense by the owner of
or person interested in the property after notice of lien has been filed, a
lien shall be released by the Village. (1975 Code §15.23)

foreclose as in case of mortgages or mechanics' liens. (1975 Code §15.24)
6-4-4: INJUNCTION TO REQUIRE COMPLIANCE:
   A.   Whenever the Building Commissioner upon due investigation determines
that any building or structure within the Village fails to conform to the
minimum standards of health and safety as set forth in the applicable
ordinances of the Village; and the owner or owners of such building or
structure fails, after due notice, to cause such property so to conform, the
Village President and Board of Trustees, by resolution, may direct the Village
legal counsel to make application requiring compliance with such ordinances or
for such other order as the court may deem necessary or appropriate to secure
such compliance. (1975 Code §15.24; amd. Ord., 11-17-75)
   B.   If, upon application hereunder, the court orders the appointment of a
receiver to cause such building or structure to conform, such receiver may use
the rents and issues of such property towards repair and rehabilitation of the
property prior to and despite any assignment of rents. The court may further
authorize the receiver to recover the costs of such repair and rehabilitation
by the issuance and sale of notes or receiver certificates bearing such
interest as the court may fix. Such notes or certificates after their initial
issuance and transfer by the receiver, shall be freely transferable and when
sold or transferred by the receiver in return for a valuable consideration in
money, material, labor and services, shall be a first lien upon the real estate
and upon the rents and issues thereof, and shall be superior to all prior
assignments of rents and all prior existing liens and encumbrances, except
taxes; provided, that within sixty (60) days of such sale or transfer for value
by the receiver of such note or certificate, the holder thereof shall file
notice of lien in the office of the recorder of deeds in the county in which
the real estate is located.
   C.   Requirements of Lien: The notice of lien filed shall set forth (1) a
description of the real estate affected sufficient for the identification
thereof, (2) the face amount of the receiver's note or certificate together
with the interest payable thereon, and (3) the date when the receiver's note or
certificate was sold or transferred for value by the receiver.
   D.   Release of Lien: Upon payment to the holder of the receiver's note or
certificate of the face amount thereof together with any interest thereon to
such date of payment, and upon the filing of record of a sworn statement of
such payment, the lien of certificate shall be released.

7-1D-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
article by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 2011-04, 1-11-2011)
7-1D-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this article;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
article; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this article or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of Fox Lake any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the building commissioner, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the building
commissioner may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 2011-04, 1-
11-2011)

highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right of way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') (1.5 m) from the right of way line and any above
grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the
right of way line or as near as practicable.
   C.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts, Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at

cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   G.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway

special permission is obtained from the building commissioner.
         b.   Open Trench And Excavated Material: Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by chapter 6 of the "Illinois
Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices". Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right of way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off road location.
         c.   Drip Line Of Trees: The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      3.   Backfilling:
         a.   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using

foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right of way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         c.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less,
encasement may be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated only
if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         f.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right of way.
      6.   Minimum Cover Of Underground Facilities: Cover shall be provided and
maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for minimum
cover for the type of facility:

misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society Of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the building
commissioner determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not
direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice
of abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to
consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by
another utility or person. (Ord. 2011-04, 1-11-2011)

right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
building commissioner or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.

authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the building commissioner may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the
purposes of this article.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the building
commissioner under the provisions of this article shall have the right to
appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
village clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The village
board shall timely decide the appeal. (Ord. 2011-04, 1-11-2011)
7-1D-22: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 2011-04, 1-11-
2011)
7-1D-23: ENFORCEMENT:

small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may
remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this article.
If the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of permits
shall be subject to the applicable Village Code provisions or regulations in
effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the Village by personal
delivery at the Village's designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail.
   C.   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such
interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of
Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Certain Utility Poles Off Limits: The wireless provider shall not
collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of
an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker
safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Complying With Codes: The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
      6.   Complying With Written Design Standards: The wireless provider shall
comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for
decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic
requirements that are set forth in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted
by the Village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies
to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in
a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a special use permit in conformance with procedures, terms and
conditions set forth in subsections 9-1-5-14B2 and B3 of the zoning ordinance.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty
dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated
application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing

      2.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      3.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      4.   The Village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights- of-way, for:
         a.   Routine maintenance;
         b.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with subsection B1d of this section; or
         c.   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
      5.   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the Village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   E.   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this article authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or

electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to
that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this article
shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement: a) to obtain a
franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video
service or b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or
operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject
to this article.
   F.   Pre-Existing Agreements: Existing agreements between the Village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this article.
A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on the
effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the Village
makes available under this article for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two
(2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the Village
that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement
remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small
wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the Village's
utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before the
wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this
paragraph.
   G.   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 1) two hundred dollars
($200.00) per year or 2) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the
wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole.
If the Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs,

               A.   A user subject to any national categorical pretreatment standards; or
               B.   A user that:
                  1.   Has an average process wastewater discharge flow of twenty-five thousand
               (25,000) gallons or more per work day (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and
               boiler blow-down wastewater); or
                  2.   Has a discharge flow of process wastewater that makes up five percent (5%) or
               more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW; or

               D.   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in subsection C of this part has
               no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW’s operation or for violating
               any pretreatment standard or requirement, the village may at any time, on its own
               initiative or in response to a petition received from a user, determine that such
               user should not be considered a significant industrial user in accordance with 40 CFR
               403.8(f)(6).
               The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial

   P.   Deficiencies In Service Pipe: In the event that the village becomes
aware of deficiencies in the service pipe, the village shall notify the owner
of such deficiencies, either in person or in writing. The owner shall have the
deficiencies corrected within thirty (30) days after such notice, after which
the water supply shall be shut off and shall not be turned on again until such
time as the deficiencies are corrected; provided, however, in the event of an
emergency as determined by the sewer and water supervisor, the owner shall be
notified to make immediate repairs, and if the owner fails or refuses to do so,
then the village may make the repairs and the owner shall be responsible for
the costs incurred by the village in making such repairs. (Ord. 2015-04, 1-13-
2015)
7-3-5: DISCHARGES INTO PUBLIC SEWERS:
Provisions regarding discharges, including use of wastewater facilities,
prohibited discharges, and regulation on FOG are contained in article A of this
chapter. Article A of this chapter contains general prohibitions that shall
apply to all users of the POTW whether or not a user is subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state or local
pretreatment standard or requirements. (Ord. 2015-04, 1-13-2015)
7-3-6: CONNECTION FEE:
   A.   All new public sewer users connecting to the Village sanitary sewer
system shall pay a sewer connection fee of three thousand eight hundred dollars
($3,800.00) per residential customer equivalent.
   B.   The connection fee described in Section A shall be allocated as
follows: two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per residential customer equivalent
to the northwest regional water reclamation facility, and one thousand eight
hundred dollars ($1,800.00) per residential customer equivalent to the local
sewer and water system.
   C.   For purposes of establishing the sewer connection fee for commercial
buildings, the residential customer equivalent of commercial buildings shall be
determined by a mathematical formula (Coef x GPD per)/250 = RCE, using the
following schedule: (Ord. 2010-01, 1-26-2010)

General note: Connection fees will be based on numbers indicated here or some
other agreed upon amount.
   Notes:
      1.    Old offices have not been modernized with modern water saving
fixtures and may include toilet facilities that use greater than 1.6 gallons
per flush.
      2.    IEPA permits may require higher coefficients.
      3.    If: a) the initial use is unknown at the time of connection then
the residential customer equivalent shall be estimated by the village engineer
or his or her designee by using a coefficient of 0.1 per square foot of space
and applying the above formula, and b) the initial use is not contained on the
above schedule, then the residential customer equivalent shall be estimated by
the village engineer or his or her designee based on actual experience with
similar uses, all subject to approval of the director of the POTW and Lake
County pursuant to the then current agreement between the village and Lake
County regarding sewage treatment. In the event that the actual first use of
all or a portion of a multi-unit commercial building is such that a greater
connection fee than estimated is warranted, then the increased connection fee
amount shall be paid prior to a business license being issued for such first
actual use.
(Ord. 2010-01, 1-26-2010; amd. Ord. 2013-20, 9-24-2013; Ord. 2015-08, 1-27-
2015)
   D.   For purposes of establishing the sewer connection fee for industrial
buildings, the industrial connection fee will be determined by the village
engineer or his or her designee by estimating the water usage for a specific
industrial use converted to residential customer equivalents based on two
hundred fifty (250) gallons per day per residential customer equivalent. For
any commercial or industrial user whose water usage materially exceeds the
usage represented in an application for sewer connection, such commercial or
industrial user shall be required to pay a supplemental connection fee based on
average actual water usage, subject to the approval of the director of the POTW
and Lake County pursuant to the then current agreement between the village and
Lake County regarding sewage treatment. (Ord. 2010-01, 1-26-2010; amd. Ord.
2015-08, 1-27-2015)
   E.   In the discretion of the village, connections to the village's sanitary
sewer system may be made by users lying outside the limits of the village but
no such connections shall be made unless the user agrees in writing to be bound
by the village's ordinances on sewers, a suitable user fee is paid by the user,
the above connection fees are paid by the user, and all costs of connection
including charges of the village engineer or his or her designee and upgrades
to the village's system needed to accommodate the new user are paid for by the
user. (Ord. 2010-01, 1-26-2010)
   F.   Except as hereinafter provided, payment of connection fees shall be due
prior to issuance of the building permit. Payment of connection fees may be
deferred in the discretion of the village board when such deferral may assist
in development of property which may otherwise remain undeveloped or
underutilized. The following provisions shall apply to such deferral:
      1.   Application for deferral shall be signed by all owners of the
property and by the proposed developer of the property and shall indicate the
proposed deferral period and the reasons therefor. Such application shall also
include:
         a.   Copy of current title policy or commitment for the property
showing owners of record;
         b.   Copy of most recent tax bills for the property; and
         c.   Nonrefundable deposit in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00) to cover the cost of staff review of the application.
      2.   Deferral requested may be either: (Ord. 2014-21, 7-8-2014)
         a.   Delay in full payment for a fixed period of time not to exceed
thirty six (36) months after the issuance of building permit(s); or (Ord. 2014-
21, 7-8-2014; amd. Ord. 2017-49, 10-24-2017)
         b.   Payment of the required connection fees in equal quarterly
installments over a period not to exceed thirty six (36) months beginning after
the issuance of building permits with the first payment due upon the earliest
of fifteen (15) months after issuance of the building permit or nine (9) months
after issuance of the occupancy permit; provided that:
            (1)   Security for one hundred five percent (105%) of the total
connection fee shall be provided for any deferral amount prior to issuance of
building permits in the form of cash or a letter of credit acceptable to the
Village Attorney. Reduction in the amount of the letter of credit or cash
deposit may be allowed annually;
            (2)   For deferral for a fixed period of time, interest shall be
payable on the deferred amount at the J.P. Morgan Chase Bank prime rate plus
three percent (3%) per annum, from the date of building permit issuance to the
date of payment in full;
            (3)   For deferral and payment in installments, interest shall be
payable on the unpaid balance from time to time at the J.P. Morgan Chase Bank
prime rate plus three percent (3%) per annum, and regular equal monthly
payments shall be required in an amount required to pay off the entire balance
within thirty six (36) months after issuance of building permits;
            (4)   Deferral shall only be permitted for commercial or industrial
development, or multi-family real estate development of more than forty (40)
units;
            (5)   Building permits must be issued within six (6) months after
approval of the deferral; and
            (6)   For properties which are located within another municipality
or sanitary district or public utility which is tributary to the NWRWRF, the
portion of the connection fee attributable to treatment by the NWRWRF may be
deferred upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, provided, that the
subject municipality or sanitary district or public utility agrees to defer its
connection fees on the same or similar terms as set forth herein and enters
into an intergovernmental agreement with the Village documenting the terms of
deferment after making an express written finding that the deferral may assist
in development of property which may otherwise remain undeveloped or
underutilized.
      3.   The Village Board shall approve or reject an application within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the complete application. If no action is
taken within that time, the application shall be deemed to be rejected.
Approval or rejection is within the sound discretion of the Village Board and
may be based on factors the Village Board deems to be relevant, including, but
not limited to: benefit of the development to the Village; effect of the
development on the Village's sewer system; conformity of the development with
the Village's Comprehensive Plan and other ordinances; and impact of the
development on surrounding properties.
      4.   If the application is approved, then prior to issuance of building
permits for the development, the owner of the property shall sign an
appropriate promissory note and recordable lien document on forms provided by
the Village. Such promissory note and lien document shall provide:
         a.   For a default rate of three percent (3%) per annum greater than
the applicable interest rate;
         b.   For nonpayment or failure to pay user fees after written notice
and a fourteen (14) day opportunity to cure a default;
         c.   For acceleration of the entire balance due after default and
foreclosure as in foreclosure of mortgages in the event of a default which is
uncured for more than thirty (30) days; and
         d.   For subordination of the lien document to a mortgage required for
development of the property, if said subordination is deemed appropriate by the
Village. (Ord. 2014-21, 7-8-2014)
         e.   For such other provisions as the Village Board requires in order
to consent to the deferral.
   G.   If sewer service to a property has been disconnected either because of
nonpayment of user fees or at the request of the owner of the property, and a
subsequent owner of the property requests reconnection, then such subsequent
ownershall be considered to be a new public sewer user under this section, and
a new connection fee shall be required. (Ord. 2017-49, 10-24-2017; amd. Ord.
2021-30, 12-14-2021)
7-3-7: SEWER USER SERVICE CHARGES:
   A.   Established: There shall be and there are hereby established, sewer
user service charges for the use of and for the service supplied by the Village
sewerage works. The Village sewerage works includes: a) the Regional Sewage
Treatment Plant commonly known as the Northwest Regional Water Reclamation
Facility (hereinafter “Regional Sewage Treatment Plant” or “NWRWRF”); and b)
the system of sewer mains, sewer services, lift stations, pumps and other
accessories and components which collect sewage from residences and other
buildings within the service area and transport it to the NWRWRF (hereinafter
“local sewage system” or “local sewer system”). Sewer user service charges
shall consist of two (2) separate components:
      1.   Charges related to the Regional Sewage Treatment Plant (hereinafter
“regional sewer user service charges”) as set forth in Section
7-3-7 E.
      2.   Charges related to the local sewage system (hereinafter “local sewer
user service charges”) as set forth in Section
7-3-7 F.
   B.   Basis Of Metering:
      1.   The local user sewer service charge shall be based on the
residential customer equivalent (RCE) minimum bimonthly volume of fifteen
thousand (15,000) gallons of average strength sewage. Charges for flows
exceeding the minimum fifteen thousand (15,000) gallons shall be based on the
water usage as recorded by approved water meters and/or sewage meters for
wastewater of average strength sewage.
      2.   Metered usage shall be read to the lowest even increment of one
thousand (1,000) gallons.
      3.   Sewer users who obtain any portion of their water service from other
than public water supply sources shall, if required by the Supervisor of Sewer
and Water, install and maintain, at no expense to the Village, water meters of
a type approved by the Supervisor of Sewer and Water for the purpose of
metering the water usage obtained from such other sources. Unless all sources
of water usage are metered, a user shall pay for sewer usage as a nonmetered
user unless actual usage exceeds the minimum volume for nonmetered users.
      4.   Wherever required by the Supervisor of Sewer and Water, sewage
metering devices shall be installed and maintained at no expense to the Village
when the volume of wastewater discharged to the public sewer cannot be
otherwise determined by use of water meters.
      5.   Metering devices shall not be removed without the consent of the
Supervisor of Sewer and Water unless sewer user service is canceled.
   C.   Determination Of Sewer User Service Charges:
      1.   Regional Sewer User Service Charges: The regional sewer user service
charges shall be determined by the amount of revenue funds required to operate
and maintain the NWRWRF; to provide funds for the replacement of component
parts of said NWRWRF for each fiscal year; to provide funds for contingencies
which may arise regarding operation of the NWRWRF; to provide for payment of
any debt service; and a General Fund transfer to compensate the Village for
certain externality costs incurred by the Village through operation of a
regional treatment plant. Despite the regional role of the Northwest Regional
Water Reclamation Facility's operations, the Village disproportionately bears
certain impacts such as odor and potential health risks, along with the related
administrative and management demands, that result in direct and indirect costs
associated with externalities of the Northwest Regional Water Reclamation
Facility, which externality costs cannot be fully ascertained or calculated,
and which may include any or all of the following: a) the cost of supplying
police and fire protection to the treatment plant and its environs; b) the risk
of tort liability or losses due to acts of God or other casualties arising out
of operation of the treatment plant; c) the risks of obtaining credit and
committing to long term financial liability when major customers could withdraw
or default on payments to the Village, potentially leaving assets stranded
while financial obligations persist; d) loss of real estate tax revenues to the
Village because the treatment plant property is not on the tax rolls; e)
inability to fully realize real estate tax revenues in the manner enjoyed by
other municipalities that utilize the treatment plant; f) decreased real estate
tax revenues to the Village because of lower equalized assessed valuations of
properties in close proximity to the treatment plant; and g) inability to
capture a return on the Village's capital investment in real estate used for
the Northwest Regional Water Reclamation Facility.
In addition, from time to time a regional inflow/infiltration surcharge may be
imposed upon all users within the regional boundaries of the NWRWRF to defray
costs of excess flow facilities designed to lessen the impacts of inflow and
infiltration on operation of the NWRWRF and the interceptors which transport
sewage to the NWRWRF.
      2.   Local Sewer User Service Charges: The local sewer user service
charge shall be determined by the amount of revenue funds required to operate
and maintain the local sewer system; to provide funds for the replacement of
components parts for each fiscal year; a debt service charge; and a surcharge,
if applicable.
   D.   Determination Of Debt Service Charge: The debt service charge shall be
determined by the amount of revenue funds required for the principal and
interest payments due for all outstanding bonds authorized and issued by the
Village for financing improvements to the sewerage works and to provide bond
reserve funds as required by Bond Ordinances.
   E.   Bimonthly regional sewer user service charges shall be as follows:
      1.   Non-Metered Sewer Users: For non-metered sewer users, a flat rate
charge of thirty- three dollars and fifty cents ($33.50) per two (2) month
period per residential customer equivalent (RCE), based on an assumed bimonthly
discharge of fifteen thousand (15,000) gallons per RCE.
      2.   Metered Sewer Users: A minimum user charge of seventeen dollars and
eighty-seven cents ($17.87) per two (2) month period plus two dollars twenty-
three cents ($2.23) per one thousand (1,000) gallons (or part thereof) over
eight thousand (8,000) gallons discharged in a two (2) month cycle based on
water meter usage.
      3.   Multiple-Dwelling Single Metered Consumers: For multiple-dwelling
unit developments that are not individually metered but have a single meter,
there shall be charged a rate computed as follows: the fixed cost charge for
each individual dwelling unit of seventeen dollars and eighty-seven cents
($17.87) per two (2) month period, plus a usage charge of two dollars twenty-
three cents ($2.23) per one thousand (1,000) gallons (or part thereof) over an
amount equal to the total number of dwelling units multiplied by (8,000)
gallons discharged in a two (2) month cycle based on water meter usage. For
example, a single water meter for a 10 unit apartment building indicates 90,000
gallons of water usage over a 2-month billing cycle would result in a total
Regional sewer charge of $ 201 calculated as follows:
      •   $178.70 minimum user charge ((minimum per unit charge of $17.87 x 10
units), covering usage up to 80,000 gallons (10 units x 8,000 gals per unit)) +
      •   $22.30 usage charge (($2.23 per 1,000 gallons) x 10,000 gallons
(90,000 usage - 80,000 gallons included))
      4.   I And I Surcharge (Excess Flow Surcharge): An inflow/infiltration
surcharge of three dollars ($3.00) per two (2) month period beginning with the
sewer user period which started on January 1, 2014.
   F.   Local Sewer Service: A fixed cost charge of fifty-five dollars and
eleven cents ($55.11) per two (2) month period per unit, plus a usage charge
of:
      1.   Non-Metered Sewer Users: For non-metered sewer users, one dollar and
fourteen cents ($1.14) per one thousand (1,000) gallons discharged based on an
assumed bimonthly discharge of fifteen thousand (15,000) gallons for each unit.
None of this fee shall be allocated to the NWRWRF.
      2.   Metered Sewer Users: For metered sewer users, one dollar and
fourteen cents ($1.14) per one thousand (1,000) gallons discharged in a two (2)
month cycle based on water meter usage.
      3.   Multiple-Dwelling Single Metered Consumers: For multiple-dwelling
unit developments that are not individually metered but have a single meter,
there shall be charged a rate computed as follows: the fixed cost charge for
each individual dwelling unit of fifty-five dollars and eleven cents ($55.11)
per two (2) month period, plus a usage charge of one dollar and fourteen cents
($1.14) per one thousand (1,000) gallons in a two (2) month cycle based on
water meter usage.
   G.   Tall Oaks System Bimonthly Charges: (Rep. by Ord. 2015-04, 1-13-2015)
   H.   Nonmetered Sewer Users: Whenever the Supervisor of Sewer and Water
determines that a nonmetered sewer user is discharging more than fifteen
thousand (15,000) gallons in a two (2) month period, the Supervisor of Sewer
and Water may require such nonmetered sewer user to install metering devices on
the building water supply or building sewer to measure the volume of wastewater
discharged to the public sewer.
   I.   Treatment Service Surcharge: A treatment service surcharge shall be
levied to all nonresidential sewer users whose wastewaters exceed the normal
concentrations of five hundred sixty five milligrams per liter (565 mg/L) of
COD, one hundred eighty eight milligrams per liter (188 mg/L) of BOD5, two
hundred thirteen milligrams per liter (213 mg/L) of suspended solids, twenty
five milligrams per liter (25 mg/L) of phosphorus and twenty three milligrams
per liter (23 mg/L) ammonia nitrogen as determined by waste sampling which
shall be performed as often as deemed necessary by the POTW and shall be
binding as the basis for computing the surcharge. All surcharge parameters have
a daily ceiling concentration limit which if surpassed will constitute cause
for a fine and corrective action by the discharger, in addition to the monthly
surcharge.
      1.   Surcharge Rates: A pollutant surcharge rate shall be calculated
annually and an addendum shall be issued to applicable users each year the rate
changes. The initial surcharge rate shall be twenty five cents ($0.25) per
pound of surchargeable pollutants.
      2.   Computation Of Surcharges: The surcharge per user shall be computed
by the following formula:
S = V(8.34) [N(COD-565 - average BOD5) + N(TSS-213) + N(BOD5-188) + N
(Phosphorus-25) + N(Ammonia-23)]
   Where:
S          = The amount of surcharge in dollars
V          = Wastewater volume in million gallons per billing period (8.34) =
             weight of water
N          = Current calculated surcharge rate
COD        = Allowable COD - (minus) allowable BOD5, mg/L - 565 = surchargeable
             COD
TSS        = Allowable TSS, mg/L - 213 = surchargeable TSS
BOD5       = Allowable BOD5, mg/L - 188 = surchargeable BOD5
Phosphorus = Allowable phosphorus, mg/L - 25 = surchargeable phosphorus
Ammonia    = Allowable ammonia, mg/L - 23 = surchargeable ammonia
 
If any parameters are found to be at or below the NWRWRF's listed average
normal strength, these parameters shall not be factored into the surcharge
formula. The concentrations of wastes discharged in excess of the above listed
average strengths shall be used for computing surcharges and shall be
established by sewage flow metering and waste sampling. If no flow monitoring
is implemented water bills shall be utilized. The discharger shall complete
waste sampling and testing, as often as may be deemed necessary by the
pretreatment coordinator and/or the wastewater discharge permit requirements
and said sampling and testing shall be binding as a basis for surcharge.
Surcharges shall not be billed until the surcharge total exceeds fifty dollars
($50.00).
The pretreatment coordinator shall annually review the actual average cost of
operation and maintenance of the POTW for the preceding three (3) years plus
the three (3) year average of the POTW depreciation beginning after the close
of the village's fiscal year, and the village board shall adjust the surcharge
rate by resolution to reflect the true cost of constituent treatment as of
January 1 of each year or at such other times as deemed necessary. Pollutant
surcharge rate shall be based on the POTW's average annual budget and
depreciation, divided by the total number of pounds of each of the pollutants
treated (BOD5, COD, TSS, ammonia and phosphorus). The current rate will be
indicated in each industrial user's wastewater discharge permit; revised
permits shall be issued annually if changes are required.
   J.   Sampling And Analysis: All sampling and/or analysis preformed by or
contracted by the NWRWRF shall be billed to the user at the NWRWRF's actual
cost plus a fifteen percent (15%) administrative fee. If the NWRWRF deems it
necessary to sample more than twice a year, because of significant
noncompliance with pollutant discharge limits set forth in this chapter, the
NWRWRF shall bill the user the NWRWRF's actual cost plus a twenty five percent
(25%) administrative fee.
   K.   Outside Village Limits: The sewer user service charges for all users
outside the corporate limits of the village shall include a surcharge of fifty
percent (50%) of the debt service charges for users within the corporate limits
of the village, unless otherwise provided in intergovernmental sewer service
agreements. In addition, the village may bill for sewer service outside the
corporate limits of the village on other than a bimonthly basis as long as the
monthly rate charged is not lower than the monthly rate charged for users
located within the village, for similar sewer service.
   L.   Annual Review: The adequacy of the sewer user service charges shall be
reviewed annually by the certified public accountants for the village in their
annual audit report. The service charges shall be revised periodically to
reflect changes in debt service or in operation and maintenance costs including
replacement costs, and to maintain the cost-rate-revenue relationships in the
user charge system.
   M.   Bimonthly Billing: Except as provided in subsection K of this section,
sewer user service charges shall be billed on a bimonthly (every 2 months)
basis to the owner of each residential premises connected to the village's
sewer system at the address of the premises or at the owner's address on file
with the village if the owner does not reside at the premises. In the case of
commercial premises, the owner may designate that the billing be directed to
the tenant at the address of the premises or at such other address that the
owner designates in writing. Bills for sewer service shall be mailed out every
two (2) months. Such bills shall be deemed delinquent if not paid within thirty
(30) days of billing date and an additional ten percent (10%) delinquency
charge shall be added to such delinquent balance.
   N.   Liability: The owner of the premises connected to the village's sewer
system, the occupant thereof and the user of the sewer service shall all be
construed to be "users" for purposes of this section and all shall be jointly
and severally liable to pay for such service to such premises, and such service
is furnished to the premises by the village only upon the condition that the
owner of the premises, occupant and user of such service are jointly and
severally liable to the village for all charges as set forth herein.
   O.   Delinquency: In the event the sewer user service charges, including any
delinquency charge then due, are not paid within sixty (60) days after the date
of billing, then an additional ten percent (10%) delinquency charge shall be
added to the delinquent balance, and thereafter the village may file a
statement of lien claim with the county recorder of deeds. This sworn statement
of lien claim shall include: 1) a legal description of the premises to which
sewer service was provided sufficient to identify the property, 2) the amount
of the unpaid sewer user service charges and delinquency charges and other
charges as provided herein, 3) the date when the amount due became delinquent,
and 4) a notice that the village claims a lien for the stated amount as well as
for all sewer service user charges and delinquency charges, subsequent to the
period for which the bill was rendered. Whenever the person whose sewer user
service charges are delinquent is not the owner of the premises to which sewer
service was provided by the village, and the village has previously received
notice of this, notice of delinquency and lien shall be mailed to the owner of
the premises at the address of the premises or at the owner's address on file
with the village. The failure of the village to record the lien with the county
recorder of deeds, or to mail the notice of delinquency and lien to the owner
of the premises or failure of the owner to receive such notice, shall not
affect the right of the village to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as
mentioned herein. The property owner shall be responsible for a fifty eight
dollar ($58.00) charge for processing and release of any lien hereunder, in
addition to actual recording charges incurred by the village for the lien claim
and the release.
   P.   Lien For Unpaid Charges: Property subject to a lien for unpaid sewer
user service charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds
of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is
the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by
bill in equity in the name of the village. The village legal counsel is hereby
authorized to institute such proceedings or other collection proceedings in the
name of the village in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against
any property for which the bill has remained unpaid sixty (60) days after it
has been rendered. In any litigation instituted by the village to collect
amounts due or foreclose liens, all persons responsible for payment of
delinquent bills shall be responsible for reasonable costs and attorney fees
incurred by the village in such litigation.
   Q.   Village Treasurer: The village treasurer shall receive all revenues
from the sewer user service charges and all other funds and monies incident to
the operation of the sewerage works as the same may be delivered to him or her
and deposit the same in the account of the fund designated as the "sewerage
fund of the village of Fox Lake". Said treasurer shall administer such fund in
every respect in the manner provided in Illinois municipal code 5/11-139 and
all other laws amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto.
   R.   Annual Notification: The users of the wastewater treatment services
will be notified annually, in conjunction with the regular bill, of the rate
and portion of the user charges which are attributable to wastewater treatment
operation, maintenance and replacement.
   S.   Nonpayment, Termination Of Service: In addition to the lien procedure
heretofore stated in this section, the village may terminate sewer service
pursuant to the following procedure:
      1.   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the village board of
trustees that in the event any person or other legal entity whose residence or
other building is connected to the village sewer system fails to pay the user
charges, service to said person or other legal entity may be discontinued.
      2.   In the event that payment of the delinquent bill and fees are not
paid within the time provided in said notice of termination, then the village
shall have the power to physically disconnect the water service and/or the
sewer service and to red tag the building. Turning off the water service at the
B-box shall be construed to constitute disconnection of the water service and/
or the sewer service. All expenses incurred by the village as a result of this
disconnection of sewer service shall be deemed additional charges for sewer
service for which a lien may be imposed upon the premises as provided by
statute.
   T.   Procedure For Discontinuing Service: The procedure to be used in
discontinuing and disconnecting said service shall be as follows:
      1.   In the event the user charge, after having been billed in accordance
with this chapter, remains unpaid sixty (60) days after payment is due, the
following notice shall be forwarded by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal service to the owner of the premises being
served by the Village sewer system at the owner's address on file with the
Village, or at the address of the premises, and in the case of commercial
premises, also to the tenant, if known to the Village:
   NOTICE OF HEARING ON DELINQUENCY
You are hereby notified that the sewer user charges billed to you under date of
           for the building located at            have not been paid and remain
delinquent. A hearing is scheduled in the council chamber of the Village Hall,
on the       day of           , 20     , at the hour of            to determine
if your service should be discontinued. If you fail to appear or if the hearing
officer finds that you are delinquent on the above payment, your sewer service
will be disconnected and your building red-tagged as unfit for human occupancy.
   Dated this       day of           , 20     .
      VILLAGE OF FOX LAKE
By:                                 
         Sewer Department
      2.   The Hearing Officer for such hearing shall be the Village
Administrator or someone designated by the Village Administrator.
      3.   If the Hearing Officer determines that the sewer service should be
discontinued, then the following fee shall be charged to the user:
A hearing fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) and an administration fee of twenty
five dollars ($25.00) to cover certified mailing costs.
The entire fee may be waived or suspended by the Hearing Officer upon good
cause having been shown. Said fee shall be added to the delinquent sewer bill
of the user and shall constitute a part of said sewer bill until paid.
      4.   If the Hearing Officer determines that the sewer service should be
discontinued for nonpayment of amounts due, the following notice shall be
forwarded by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by
personal service, to the owner of the premises being served by the Village
sewer system at the owner's address on file with the Village, or at the address
of the premises, and in the case of commercial premises, also to the tenant, if
known to the Village:
   NOTICE OF TERMINATION
You are hereby notified that at a hearing held on the         day of
          , 20     , the hearing officer determined that your sewer service
should be discontinued for failure to pay your sewer bill, the total of which
at the present time is $             . You are hereby notified that if payment
of said amount is not made within 15 days after the date of mailing or personal
service of this Notice, that the Village will physically disconnect the sewer
service of your building from the Village sewer system, and will red-tag the
building at                , as unfit for human occupancy.
   Dated this       day of           , 20     .
      VILLAGE OF FOX LAKE
   By:                            
         Hearing Officer
      5.   In the event that payment of the delinquent bill(s) and delinquency
charges and other fees is not made within the time provided in said notice of
termination, then the Village shall have the power to physically disconnect the
water service and/or the sewer service and to red tag the building. All
expenses incurred by the Village as a result of this disconnection, including,
but not limited to, labor costs and costs of equipment needed to excavate the
site and effect the disconnection, shall be added to the amount of the
delinquency and shall be additional monies owed the Village. In addition
thereto, the person or entity responsible for said payment shall incur a charge
for reconnection of two hundred dollars ($200.00), plus any fees required for
permits, inspection, or charges for labor, material and equipment costs for
reexcavation and reconnection, and late charges and/or delinquency charges as a
consequence of said reconnection. The Village may impose a lien upon the
premises, as provided by statute, for all such expenses, including recording
charges, incurred as a result of said disconnection and reconnection. In
addition, in the discretion of the Village, a deposit of one (1) year's
estimated sewer usage may be required prior to reconnection. Said deposit shall
not be applied by the customer to bills due after reconnection. No reconnection
shall be made without payment made of all delinquent amounts due for the
property.
      6.   The Board of Trustees hereby declares it to be against public policy
for a building to be occupied by human inhabitants after it has been red tagged
by the Village as being unfit for human occupancy.
   U.   Transfer Of Real Property: No transfer of real property within the
corporate limits of the Village may be completed unless the Village Water and
Sewer Department has been notified of the impending transfer and has given its
statement of final fees and charges for water service and sanitary sewage
treatment service to the property to be paid at the time of closing, or has
given its written statement that there are no outstanding charges relative to
the said property. In the event that property is acquired without payment made
for water service and/or sewer service due at the time of acquisition, then the
person acquiring the property shall be responsible for payment of the charges
due at the time of acquisition.
   V.   Disputed Billings:
      1.   Users of the Village's sewer system are required to examine billings
for sewer user service and to notify the Village in writing within sixty (60)
days after the date of such billing of any alleged inaccuracy in the billing.
The local Sewer and Water Department shall promptly review such notification
and if an error is determined to exist, will make any billing adjustments
required to conform the billing to the actual amount due. If notification is
not received by the Village within sixty (60) days of the date of a billing,
then the amount of the billing shall be conclusive and no adjustments shall
thereafter be made.
      2.   If a billing inaccuracy is alleged and if information is supplied
which is inaccurate or deceptive or based upon tampering with previously
approved pipes, meters or other equipment, then all of the Village's costs in
evaluating the allegation shall be billed to and paid by the person alleging
the inaccuracy. If it is determined that residential units were added without
notice to the Village or without securing proper building permits and
inspections, then connection fees shall be charged to the owner as well as user
fees from the date of adding the unit to the date of discovery by the Village.
      3.   In case of excessive water use due to casualty (i.e., broken pipes,
leaking fixtures, vandalism, etc.), all charges for sewer and water will apply
unless the water user can prove that the water did not enter the sanitary sewer
system. If this can be proven, the charges for sewage treatment shall not apply
and the average usage for the preceding twelve (12) months for sewer usage will
be billed in lieu of the excessive use for the billing period. Such
determinations shall be made by the Sewer and Water Supervisor. (Ord. 2020-01,

Village sewer system, then a new connection fee shall be paid prior to such
reconnection. Similarly, the owner of a premises with more than one (1)
residential unit may petition the Village for one (1) or more of the units to
be disconnected from the Village sewer system if the premises is remodeled and
said remodeling is verified by the Village's Building Department, and if such
petition is granted, then sewer user fees for the discontinued unit shall no
longer be charged, but if a request is later made by such owner or his
successor to reconnect to the Village sewer system, then a new connection fee
shall be paid prior to such reconnection. (Ord. 2016-21, 6-14-2016)

Pursuant to the requirements of title III of the clean water act amendments (33
USC 1311 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Illinois
environmental protection act of 1970 as amended 1 , and in accordance with
Illinois municipal code 2 , this article is hereby enacted by the board of
trustees of the village of Fox Lake. The village of Fox Lake is hereafter
referred to as the "publicly owned treatment works" or as the "POTW". (Ord.

Notes
1 1. 415 ILCS 5/1 et seq.
2 2. 65 ILCS 5/11-144-1 et seq.
7-3A-2: PURPOSE AND POLICY:
This article regulates the use of sewers, private wastewater disposal, and the
discharge of wastewater into the POTW wastewater system. This article sets
forth uniform requirements for discharges into the wastewater collection and
treatment system of the POTW. The purposes of this article are:
   A.   To establish uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributors
to the wastewater collection and treatment system owned and operated by the
Village of Fox Lake, and enable the northwest regional water reclamation
facility (NWRWRF), and the local sewer system, to comply with applicable state
and federal laws and the general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR part 403).
   B.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipality's
wastewater system which will:
      1.   Interfere with the operations of the system;
      2.   Cause the treatment plant to violate its NPDES discharge permits;
      3.   Contaminate the sludge;
      4.   Pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters
or the atmosphere;
      5.   Pose a health threat to sewer workers; or
      6.   Otherwise be incompatible with the system.
   C.   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge
from the system; and
   D.   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005 ; amd. Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021 ;
Ord. 2021-30, 12-14-2021)
7-3A-3: JURISDICTION:
   A.   This article shall apply to the POTW and the persons outside the POTW
who are users of the POTW.
   B.   Regulation Of Waste Received From Other Jurisdictions:
      1.   If another municipality, or user located within another
municipality, contributes wastewater to the POTW, the village shall enter into
an intergovernmental agreement with the contributing municipality.
      2.   The village shall request the following information from the
contributing municipality at a frequency determined by the village:
         a.   A description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharge
to the POTW by the contributing municipality;
         b.   An inventory of all users located within the contributing
municipality that are discharging to the POTW; and
         c.   Such other information as the pretreatment coordinator may deem
necessary.
      3.   An intergovernmental agreement, as required by paragraph 1, above,
shall contain the following conditions:
         a.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt a sewer
use ordinance which is at least as stringent as this chapter and local limits
which are at least as stringent as those set out in sections
7-3A-12 and
7-3A-13 for the area to be served by the village. The requirement shall specify
that such ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to reflect changes
made to the village’s ordinance or local limits.
         b.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to submit a
revised non-residential user inventory at a frequency determined by the village
but likely on an annual basis;
         c.   A provision specifying that pretreatment implementation
activities, including wastewater discharge permit issuance, inspection and
sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the pretreatment coordinator;
         d.   A requirement for the contributing municipality to provide the
pretreatment coordinator with access to all information that the contributing
municipality obtains as part of its pretreatment activities;
         e.   Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing
municipality’s wastewater at the point where it discharges to the POTW;
         f.   Requirements for monitoring the contributing municipality’s
discharge;
         g.   A provision ensuring the pretreatment coordinator access to the
facilities of users located within the contributing municipality’s
jurisdictional boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling, and any
other duties deemed necessary by the pretreatment coordinator; and
         h.   A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms
of the inter-municipal agreement. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2021-08,

7-3A-4: EFFECTIVE DATE:
(Rep. by Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-5: RIGHT OF REVISION:
The POTW reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in individual or
general wastewater permits, more stringent limitations or requirements on any
discharge to the POTW. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-6: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision, paragraph, word, or section of this article is invalidated by
any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions, paragraphs,
words, sections and articles shall not be affected and shall continue in full
force and effect. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)

Except as otherwise provided herein, the director of the POTW or his/her
designee shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this
article. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2010-03, 1-26-2010; Ord. 2015-08,
1-27-2015; Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-9: COMPLIANCE SCREENING:
   A.   The compliance screening process consists of review of all available
information and identification of any violations of compliance orders,
reporting requirements and applicable pretreatment standards. This review shall
be conducted by the pretreatment coordinator and will be conducted as data and
reports are received. The purpose of compliance screening is to identify
specific violations, not to determine appropriate enforcement responses. All
reports and self-monitoring requirements should be reviewed to determine that
they are submitted according to schedule, cover the proper time period, include
all information required and have been properly signed and certified. The
pretreatment coordinator should confirm that the industry used the proper
method of analysis, sampling procedures, custody sheets and that discharge
limits were met. All instances of noncompliance, whether it be an exceedance of
discharge limits, incorrect sampling procedures or improper certification of a
report, shall be recorded in a logbook or file specific to that industry.
   B.   Guidelines for compliance screening may be found in ordinance 2000-45,
and any amendments thereto, on file in the office of the city clerk. (Ord.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND PRETREATMENT REGULATIONS
7-3A-11: USE OF WASTEWATER FACILITIES:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any person to deposit or discharge, or to
cause to be deposited or discharged, to any POTW, any solid, liquid or gaseous
waste unless through a connection approved by the POTW.
   B.   It shall be unlawful to discharge wastewater, without an NPDES permit,
to any natural outlet within the POTW or any area under its jurisdiction.
   C.   It shall be unlawful to discharge trucked or hauled pollutants to the
POTW except at discharge points designated by the POTW as per 40 CFR 403.5 (b)
(8).
   D.   Users must meet the most stringent applicable requirements and
limitations at all other times either as set forth in this chapter, or in
individual wastewater discharge permits, federal pretreatment standards as
established by 40 CFR Part 403, or state of Illinois standards as codified in
35 IAC 307. Said users shall provide the necessary wastewater treatment to
achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards and
requirements within the time limitations as specified by the federal
pretreatment regulations, and with any other pretreatment standards including
local limits and requirements, by applicable deadlines.
   E.   Each FSE shall provide wastewater pretreatment and implement best
management practices as necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve
compliance with all local limits and the prohibitions set out in sections
7-3A-12 and
7-3A-13 within the time limitations specified by the pretreatment coordinator.
(Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-12: PROHIBITIVE DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
   A.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water,
foundation drain water, ground water, roof runoff, surface drainage, cooling
waters, or any other unpolluted water to any sanitary sewer.
   B.   No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater contaminant which will cause pass
through, cause interference with, inhibition of, or potential problem to the
operation or performance of the POTW.
   C.   The following general prohibitions shall apply to all users of the POTW
whether or not a user is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards
or any other national, state or local pretreatment standard or requirements. A
user shall not contribute the following substances to the POTW:
      1.   Any liquids, solids, or gases that result in toxic gases, vapors or
fumes within the POTW in quantities that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems, or be hazardous in any other way to the operation of the POTW
or its employees as outlined in 40 CFR 403.5(b)(7). At no time shall two (2)
successive readings on a meter capable of reading LEL (lower explosive limit)
at a point at the nearest accessible point to the POTW in a sanitary sewer, at
the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW be more than
five percent (5%) nor any single reading greater than ten percent (10%).
Materials for which discharge is prohibited under this subsection include, but
are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene,
ethers, alcohols, ketone, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates,
bromates, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated biphenyls, carbides,
hydrides, Stoddard solvents and sulfides.
      2.   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances, to cause fire or explosion or be hazardous in any other way to the
POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall the waste stream have a
closed cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit (140°F)
or sixty degrees centigrade (60°C) (the RCRA ignitability standard for liquid
characteristic waste) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR section
261.21. (Examples include, but are not limited to: cyanide, gasoline, kerosene,
benzene, toluene, alcohols, polychlorinated biphenyls, and Stoddard solvents.)
      3.   Solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction
to the flow in the sanitary sewer and/or POTW resulting in interference with
the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, including, but not
limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch (1/2") in
any dimension, animal gut or tissue, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or
fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime,
stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags,
spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, glass grindings,
polishing wastes, or tumbling and deburring stones.
      4.   Any petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that cause pass-through or interference.
      5.   Any wastewater which will cause corrosive structural damage to the
POTW, but in no case wastewater having a pH less than five (5.0) or greater
than ten (10.0).
      6.   Pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.)
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference
with the POTW.
      7.   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either
singly or by interaction with other wastewaters are sufficient to create a
public nuisance or are sufficient to prevent entry into sewers for their
maintenance and repair or endanger POTW or sewer workers' health or safety.
      8.   In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW
to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or
regulations developed under section 405 of the act. Substances discharged to
the POTW shall not affect sludge use or disposal criteria developed pursuant to
RCRA, SWDA, the clean water act, the toxic substances control act, or state
regulation subtitle C part 391 applicable to the sludge management plan being
used.
      9.   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit
or the receiving water quality standards.
      10.   Any wastewater having a temperature at the point of discharge which
will inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant, resulting in
interference. In no instance shall wastewater be introduced to the sewer system
which exceeds forty degrees centigrade (40°C) (104°F).
      11.   Any wastewater containing pollutants released at a flow or
concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference
to the POTW or will pass through the POTW.
      12.   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by state or
federal regulations. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005)
      13.   Any wastewater containing BOD5, COD, total solids, suspended
solids, ammonia nitrogen, or phosphorus of such character and quantity that
unusual attention or expense is required to handle such materials at the POTW.
A user may be permitted by specific, written discharge permit through the
village in which agreement to discharge such BOD5, COD, suspended solids,
ammonia nitrogen or phosphorus may be provided using special charges, payments
or provisions for treatment and analysis.
      14. Ammonia nitrogen in amounts that would cause a violation of the water
quality standards of the receiving waters of the POTW.
      15.   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction to injure, interfere with or cause potential
problem with any POTW treatment processes or facilities, constitute a hazard to
humans or animals, or to exceed the standards established in the existing act,
or the act as it may be amended.
      16.   Any trucked or hauled pollutants, unless at points designated and
approved by the POTW.
      17.   Any slug discharge.
      18.   Any discharge which causes the transmittance of the POTW's final
effluent to fall below sixty five percent (65%) at two hundred fifty four (254)
nanometers.
      19.   Any wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by
treatment processes, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's
final effluent.
      20.   Detergents, surface active agents, or other substances which may
cause excessive foaming at the POTW.
      21.   Medical wastes, including any wastewater containing organisms,
including viruses, considered pathogenic and/or detrimental to POTW organisms
other than by direct excrement.
      22.   Wastewater or wastes containing iron pickling wastes or
concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not.
      23.   Any sludge, screenings or other residues from the pretreatment of
non-residential wastes.
      24.   Inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to Fullers earth,
lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not
limited to sodium chloride and sodium sulfate) that causes potential problems
or interferes with POTW operations.
      25.   Wastewater or wastes containing substances which are not amendable
to treatment or reduction by the POTW treatment processes employed, or are
amendable to treatment only to such degree that the POTW effluent cannot meet
the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the
receiving waters.
      26.   Any wastewater causing the POTW effluent to fail a toxicity test.
Compliance with the provisions of this section shall be required on the
effective date of the promulgation of this article. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005;
amd. Ord. 2006-34, 8-22-2006; Ord. 2011-18, 6-28-2011; Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)

   C.   FSE Twenty-Five Percent (25%) Requirement: The village may apply the
twenty-five percent (25%) requirement at the discharge side of the external
grease interceptor (GI) prior to mixing with any other wastewater from the
contributing FSE’s property in lieu of the limits listed in section
7-3A-13.A above if a representative sample cannot be obtained. The last section
of an external GI at an FSE shall be measured to determine that the total
volume of the GI being used for any food-derived solids to settle or accumulate
plus the floatable grease- derived materials that rise and accumulate,
identified as a solids blanket and grease cap respectively, is less than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the total design hydraulic depth as measured from
the effluent discharge pipe to the bottom (“twenty-five percent (25%)
requirement”). The village may also apply the twenty-five percent (25%)
requirement for external GI that are used in non-FSE locations such as an
automobile service, repair and dispensing properties.
   D.   The village will apply the local limits found in sections
7-3A-13.A and B. above normally at the end-of-pipe point where the non-
residential waste is discharged to the municipal sewer system.
   E.   The village reserves the right to establish requirements, by ordinance
or in a wastewater discharge permit or general permit, to require control over
the quantities and rates of discharge from any user.
   F.   The village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in a
wastewater discharge permit, mass limitations rather than concentration
limitations on discharges particularly if users are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   G.   The village reserves the right to set specific limits for those
pollutants not identified in sections
7-3A-13.A and B. on a case by case basis for impacts caused to the treatment
works including but not limited to interference, potential problems, pass
through and prevention of beneficial sludge re-use. Those limits shall be set
forth in a wastewater discharge permit per section
7-3A-23.
      1.   Local limits for additional pollutants not identified in sections
7-3A-13.A. or B. will be noticed to the permit holder a minimum of thirty (30)
days prior to the effective date of the wastewater discharge permit or within
thirty (30) days of notifying the village of additional pollutants if a permit
has already been issued. In the event that the village receives written comment
on said limit during the comment period, the limit will take effect within
sixty (60) days of the public notice date to allow review and comment by the
village.
   H.   The village may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance
or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits, to implement
local limits and the requirements of section
7-3A-12.
   I.   Any user whose discharge may be pretreated and/or treated more
effectively by the village, and discharges to the village’s POTW that cause the
village to alter its method of wastewater treatment or sludge disposal to a
more costly method shall be assessed the differential cost between the more
costly method of treatment and the less costly method of treatment. Such costs
shall only be assessed upon approval of the village board.
   J.   The village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in
wastewater discharge permits or general permits, more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this
chapter. The specific limitations on discharge listed in section
7-3A-13B. are derived from the maximum allowable industrial loading (MAIL)
calculation. The MAILSs are allocated only to those IUs, at the village’s
discretion, that contribute the regulated pollutant and all remaining IUs are
held to either the background concentration or slightly higher than background
but lower than the specific discharge limit. In no case shall the total of all
allocations exceed the MAIL.
   K.   The village will maintain a reserve of the maximum allowable headworks
pollutant loading for each pollutant for new industries or increase with
existing industries. The village will recalculate the maximum concentrations
from time to time using site specific data taking into consideration revisions
to state and federal regulations that may impact the calculations. (Ord. 2005-
10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2011-18, 6-28-2011; Ord. 2015-08, 1-27-2015; Ord.
2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-14: INCORPORATION OF NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The pretreatment requirements shall apply to all non-residential users subject
to national categorical pretreatment standards, promulgated by the USEPA in
accordance with section 307(b) and (c) of the act, currently discharging or
scheduled to discharge to the village.
The national categorical pretreatment standards, found at 40 CFR chapter I,
subchapter N, parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated into this article.
Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the discharge from
the process regulated by the standard or as otherwise specified by the
standard. Compliance with national categorical pretreatment standards is
mandatory.
   A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with paragraphs E and F below and 40 CFR 403.6(c) unless
specifically restricted by the categorical pretreatment standard. These
equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with the following requirements
are deemed pretreatment standards. Users shall be required to comply with the
equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from
which the equivalent limitations were derived. An alternative pretreatment
limit shall not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical
detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants.
   B.   1.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production, the
pretreatment coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to
individual users.
      2.   The village calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations shall
calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the
user's average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be
based not upon the designed production capacity, but rather upon a reasonable
measure of the user's actual long-term daily production during a representative
year. For new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected
production.
      3.   The village calculating equivalent concentration limitations shall
calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations by the average
daily flow rate of the user's regulated process wastewater. This average daily
flow rate must be based upon a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-
term average flow rate, such as the average daily flow rate during the
representative year.
   C.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the pretreatment
coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) provided that the regulation allows the wastewaters
to be mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to allow issuance
of an alternative limit.
   D.   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard
from USEPA if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
   E.   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. (When a categorical pretreatment standard is
expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, a user may request that
the village convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to
convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the
pretreatment coordinator. The village may establish equivalent mass limits only
if the user meets all the conditions set forth in sections 1(a) through 1(e)
below.
      1.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the user must:
         a.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its
individual wastewater discharge permit;
         b.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         c.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous
effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average
production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term
average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
         d.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to
control the discharge; and
         e.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user's request for
equivalent mass limits.
      2.   A user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         a.   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         b.   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         c.   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the
pretreatment coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more
than twenty percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in
paragraph 1(c) of this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate,
the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise
the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         d.   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph 1(a) of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      3.   When developing equivalent mass limits, the pretreatment
coordinator:
         a.   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         b.   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the
equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
         c.   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the user's actual average daily
flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates
used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on
the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section
7-3A-16. The user must be in compliance with section
7-3A-33C regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   F.   The pretreatment coordinator may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419 and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual users. The conversion is at the discretion of the pretreatment
coordinator.
   G.   Once included in its wastewater discharge permit, the user must comply
with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
   H.   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or 4-day average, limitations. Where such
standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used
in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitations.
   I.   Any user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or
concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify
the pretreatment coordinator with two (2) business days after the user has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the pretreatment
coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or
concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of
the long term average production rate.
All users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment standards are
required to file reports as required in this chapter, signed by an authorized
representative. These reports shall include all information that the village
deems necessary to make compliance determinations. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005;
amd. Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-15: PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment and best
management practices as required to comply with the most stringent requirements
of this article, federal pretreatment standards, as established by 40 CFR
chapter N, subpart I, Illinois state standards and any permit conditions.
Industrial users shall achieve compliance with all national categorical
pretreatment standards within the time limitations specified by federal
pretreatment regulations, and with any other pretreatment standard by
applicable deadlines.
   B.   1.   All facilities required to pretreat wastewater shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the POTW for review, and shall be approved by the pretreatment coordinator
before construction of the facility. The review and approval of plans and
operating procedures does not relieve the industrial user from complying with
the provisions of this article and other permit conditions. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and approved by the pretreatment coordinator prior to the industrial user's
initiation of the changes.
      2.   All users are required to comply with IEPA permitting requirements.
Users shall obtain all necessary construction-operating permits from the IEPA
prior to the village connection and/or discharge permit(s) being issued. IEPA
will make the determination of actual permitting requirements based on changes
in the wastewater volume or characteristics generated at the user site. The
village will track and parallel this IEPA permitting process. No sources of
non-residential wastewater will be allowed to discharge to the POTW until all
permitting requirements have been satisfied. Such pretreatment facilities shall
be under the control and direction of an IEPA certified wastewater operator.
   C.   The village may require the additional pretreatment measures defined
below:
      1.   Whenever deemed necessary, the pretreatment coordinator may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocated and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      2.   The pretreatment coordinator may require any person or user
discharging into the POTW to install and maintain on their property and at
their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. The village may issue an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit solely for flow equalization.
      3.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

7-3A-16: PROHIBITION OF DILUTION:
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement, no industrial user shall increase the use of process
water or, in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate pretreatment to achieve compliance with any
pretreatment standard or specific limitation. The control authority may impose
mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd.
Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-17: SPILL CONTAINMENT:
   A.   All non-residential users shall provide protection from accidental
discharge and slug control of materials which may interfere with the POTW, by
developing an accidental discharge/slug control plan. Facilities are required
to have an accidental discharge/slug control plan if:
      1.   Chemicals (raw materials, chemical intermediates, wastes to be
recycled, final products, or utility chemicals) that total or exceed two
hundred fifty (250) gallons at or on its site;
      2.   Prohibited discharge materials as defined in section
7-3A-12 at or on its site;
      3.   Hazardous waste as defined in section
7-3A-25D at or on its site; or

control slug discharges.
      All non-residential users that meet the above criteria are required to
develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan whether the
user is regulated by a discharge permit or not. Facilities necessary to
implement these plans shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s or
industrial user’s expense.
   B.   Industrial users that store hazardous substances shall not contribute
to the POTW after the effective date hereof unless a spill prevention plan has
been approved by pretreatment coordinator. Approval of such plans shall not
relieve the industrial user from complying with all other laws and regulations
governing concerning the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous
substances.
   C.   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure of its pretreatment facility, until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-
15-2005; amd. Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-18: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG CONTROL PLAN AND NOTIFICATION:
   A.   Accidental Discharge And Slug Control Plan: Within one (1) year of a
significant industrial user classification, the pretreatment coordinator shall
evaluate whether the significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/
slug control plan. The pretreatment coordinator may require any user to
develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. An accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals including quantity of chemicals and
type and number of storage containers;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under section
7-3A-12 of this article, with procedures for follow up written notification
within five (5) days;
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills or slug
discharges, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and
transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment,
measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
      5.   Site diagram showing location of all tanks holding greater than or
equal to two hundred fifty (250) gallons or areas containing eight (8) drums or
more of raw materials, prohibited wastes, wastes to be recycled, hazardous
wastes or final product.
      6.   Location of notice/signs posted in conspicuous places advising
employees in English and the language of common use whom to call in the event
of a spill, accidental discharge of prohibited materials, slug discharge or a
bypass of any part of a pretreatment system; and
      7.   Emergency telephone number (24 hour) off-site and backup telephone
number. If the spill prevention plan has been submitted, any change in the
telephone numbers should be submitted within five (5) working days when
revised.
      8.   Notification procedures for immediately notifying the pretreatment
coordinator of any accidental or slug discharges.
      9.   Documentation: The accidental discharge/slug control plan shall
contain a sample of the documentation maintained at the site that:
         a.   Ensures that all employees who are in a position to cause,
discover, or observe such discharge are advised of the emergency notification
procedures; and
         b.   Such logs to verify inspection and maintenance procedures to
prevent adverse impacts and confirm that said procedures are being performed on
a regular basis.
   B.   Review of such plans and operating procedures by the village shall not
relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's accidental
discharge/slug control plan as necessary to meet all requirements of this
chapter. Review by the village does not constitute an approval of an accidental
discharge/slug control plan and the village and its designee(s) are not to be
construed as responsible for the actions of the user and any impacts the user
may cause as a result of a spill or slug load.
   C.   Non-residential users with an accidental discharge/slug control plan
shall update their plan every two (2) years and train their employees on how to
handle a spill or slug load annually. For permitted users, the updated plan and
training logs shall be submitted to NWRWRF.
   D.   Notification Of Spill Or Slug Discharge:
      1.   Notification Required: In the case of any discharge in violation of
this article or permit conditions, and in the case of any discharge that could
cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings as described in section
7-3-1 of this chapter, the industrial user shall immediately notify the POTW of
the discharge by telephone. If there is no answer and after hours, the
industrial user will call the village of Fox Lake police department
nonemergency number. The notification shall include:
         a.   The date, time, location and duration of the discharge;
         b.   The type of waste, including concentration and volume; and
         c.   All corrective actions taken by the user.
      2.   Written Report: Within five (5) days following such an accidental
discharge or deliberate discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the POTW
a written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken to prevent similar future occurrences.
      3.   Liability: Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability resulting from the discharge, nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed under this article or other applicable
state or federal law.
      4.   Notification Of Changed Discharge: All industrial users shall
promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or
character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted
initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord.
2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-19: FATS, OIL AND GREASE DISCHARGE POLICY:
   A.   Grease Interceptor Installation Requirement Criteria: Grease
interceptors are required for all facilities used and operated regularly for
the commercial preparation of foods. Businesses requiring grease interceptors
include, but are not limited to, restaurants, cafes, fast food outlets, pizza
outlets, delicatessens, sandwich shops, and any other kinds and types of food
vending establishments in which any food preparation (including heating or
defrosting in or by means of any kind of oven or heating device) takes place on
the premises, whether or not such facilities are located in a separate building
or structure or occupied by other businesses, as well as schools, churches,
boarding houses with communal kitchen facilities, nursing homes, and daycare
centers which have kitchens and engage in the preparation of food.
If there is more than one building in the facility in which food preparation
takes place, each building shall have its own grease interceptor sized as
outlined in the minimum requirements or all buildings may discharge to a single
grease interceptor that has been sized to the criteria for each individual
kitchen.
The exception shall be those facilities granted a variance, after review and
approval from the director of the POTW. Grease interceptors shall not be
required for private residences or dwellings.
   B.   Grease Interceptor Design Criteria: Each business establishment, for
which a grease interceptor is required, shall have a dedicated service and
grease interceptor. The design of the grease interceptor shall be in accordance
with the minimum requirements enacted by the village of Fox Lake as indicated
below, and shall have a minimum of two (2) compartments with fittings designed
for grease retention.
Minimum requirements:
      1.   Installation of an outside grease interceptor with a minimum liquid
holding capacity of one thousand (1,000) gallons. (Sandwich bars and carryout
services, which only prepare noncooked foods such as cold sandwiches, shall
install a minimum 400 gallon grease interceptor unless the director of the POTW
grants a variance.)
      2.   Installation of a four foot (4') diameter inspection/sampling
manhole downstream of grease interceptor.
      3.   All miscellaneous sinks, slop sinks, floor drains, water wash hoods,
etc., located in the kitchen area shall be plumbed to connect into the new
grease interceptor.
      4.   Prohibited discharge to the grease interceptor includes:
         a.   All washroom facilities.
         b.   Food waste grinders.
         c.   Dishwashing machines.
There shall be an adequate number of manholes to provide access for the
cleaning of all areas of an interceptor; a minimum of one per interceptor
section, and one sampling manhole directly downstream of the interceptor and
prior to the effluent entering the sewer main. Manhole covers shall be gastight
in construction and have a minimum opening dimension of twenty four inches
(24").
One complete set of plans shall be submitted to the village of Fox Lake
building department, these plans at a minimum shall include mechanical and
plumbing sections. Additionally, the plans shall include size, type and
location of each interceptor proposed.
The village of Fox Lake building commissioner shall approve these plans
including size, type and location of the interceptor prior to any construction
at the proposed site.
   C.   Grease Interceptor's Location: Each grease interceptor shall be
installed and connected such that it is easily accessible at all times for
inspection, cleaning, and the removal of intercepted grease. The grease
interceptor(s) shall be located as close to the source as practical, however it
must be outside the facility served whenever possible. The village of Fox Lake
building commissioner prior to any construction on the proposed site shall
approve the location of any grease interceptor.
   D.   Inspection Of Grease Interceptors: The village of Fox Lake industrial
pretreatment department shall inspect all grease interceptors within the
village of Fox Lake and develop a mechanism to inventory all grease
interceptors of properties connected to the collection system, and document the
inspections of these grease interceptors. Once all the grease interceptors in
the service area are identified, the grease interceptors shall be classified
into two (2) categories:
      1.   Problem Or Significant Grease Interceptors: The facilities connected
to these grease interceptors contribute significant amounts of animal/vegetable
fats, oil, grease and/or admissible wastes to the collection system or
facilities which have been defined as a chronic problem facility. These grease
interceptors shall be inspected and documented at a frequency of once every six
(6) months or as deemed necessary.
      2.   Nonsignificant Grease Interceptor: The facilities connected to these
grease interceptors do not contribute significant amounts of animal/vegetable
fats, oil, grease and/or admissible wastes to the collection system. These
grease interceptors shall be inspected and documented at a frequency of once
every twelve (12) months or as deemed necessary.
   E.   Grease Interceptor Maintenance And Pumping Schedules:
      1.   It shall be the responsibility of the owner to assure that proper
maintenance and pumping/cleaning of the grease interceptor is properly
performed and documented. All grease interceptors shall be maintained in
efficient operating condition. When pumping/cleaning of the grease interceptor
is performed the entire contents of the grease interceptor shall be removed,
which includes the removal of all accumulated grease, solids and liquid. The
pumping/cleaning of the grease interceptor shall be performed in accordance
with the schedule listed below and shall be performed in a manner that does not
discharge grease into the collection system. At no time may any portion of the
contents removed from the grease interceptor be discharged back into the grease
interceptor or the sanitary sewer system. The owner/lessee shall conduct, on a
monthly basis, an inspection of each interceptor. At no time may the
accumulated grease and/or solids exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the
holding capacity of the grease interceptor. These inspections and cleanings
must be documented and the records kept on site for a minimum of two (2) years.
Records to be kept on site shall include a maintenance log showing each date of
pumping or service and copies of receipts and manifests describing each pumping
or service. All records shall be made available to the pretreatment inspector
(upon request). All grease and/or solids removed from the grease interceptor
must be properly documented and disposed of by a licensed waste hauler.
      2.   All existing business/industrial users connected to grease
interceptors prior to the implementation of this fats, oil and grease discharge
policy are required to pump and clean their interceptor(s) at a minimum
frequency of once every thirty (30) days. Inspections and samplings of grease
interceptor(s) by the village of Fox Lake pretreatment department shall
determine if this pumping/cleaning frequency is adequate to control the amounts
of fats, oils, grease and/or admissible wastes entering the collection system
or if the pumping/cleaning frequency needs to be adjusted. The village of Fox
Lake pretreatment department has the right to increase the pumping and cleaning
frequency as deemed necessary. All requests to reduce the pumping/cleaning
frequency must be submitted to the village of Fox Lake pretreatment department,
in letter form. The address is:
Village of Fox Lake NWRWRF
   Pretreatment Department
   200 Industrial Avenue
   Fox Lake, IL 60020
The village of Fox Lake pretreatment department must approve any changes to
this frequency in writing prior to any change being made. In addition, the
village of Fox Lake pretreatment department may require the business/industrial
user to implement best management practices in order to reduce its discharge to
acceptable levels.
      3.   All new, remodeled and/or chronic problem facilities required to
connect to a grease interceptor(s) in accordance with the provision of this
policy are required to pump and clean their interceptor(s) once every sixty
(60) days (or every other month) or as required by village of Fox Lake
pretreatment department. Inspections and samplings of grease interceptor(s) by
the village of Fox Lake pretreatment department shall determine if this
pumping/cleaning frequency is adequate to control the amounts of fats, oils,
grease and admissible wastes entering the collection system or if the pumping/
cleaning frequency needs to be adjusted. The village of Fox Lake pretreatment
department has the right to increase the pumping and cleaning frequency as
deemed necessary. All requests to reduce the pumping/cleaning frequency must be
submitted to the village of Fox Lake pretreatment department, in letter form.
The address is:
Village of Fox Lake NWRWRF
   Pretreatment Department
   200 Industrial Avenue
   Fox Lake, IL 60020
The village of Fox Lake pretreatment department must approve any changes to
this frequency in writing prior to any changes being made.
      4.   If deficiencies are found during an inspection performed by the
village of Fox Lake, the owner shall have three (3) weeks to bring the facility
into compliance. If the grease interceptor fails a second (consecutive)
inspection, the village of Fox Lake shall require the owner to contract with a
qualified contractor to install new or additional equipment to bring the
facility into compliance. This work shall be completed within six (6) months of
the date the village requires such contract to be made. The cost of all work
required to bring the facility into compliance shall be the burden of the
owner.
   F.   Biological Treatment: Biological treatment shall not be a substitute
for the complete pumping of the grease interceptor at the frequency described
in this policy.
   G.   Existing Sources Not Connected To Grease Interceptors: Existing sources
of fats, oil, grease and/or admissible wastes not connected to grease
interceptors, which contribute significant amounts of fats, oil, grease and/or
admissible wastes will be identified through inspection of the collection
system by the village of Fox Lake sewer department. Once these sources are
identified, the sewer department shall notify the pretreatment department of
their presence. The pretreatment department shall in writing require these
facilities to implement best management practices (BMPs) to keep fats, oil,
grease and excessive amounts of admissible waste out of the wastewater
collection system. All BMPs must be submitted to the pretreatment department
for review and approval. Examples of a BMP include:
      1.   Scrape food from plates into garbage cans.
      2.   Prewash plates by spraying them off with cold water over a small
mesh catch basin positioned over a drain. This catch basin should be cleaned
into a garbage can as needed.
      3.   Pour all liquid oil and grease from pots and pans into a waste
grease bucket stored at the pot washing sink. Heavy solids buildup of oil and
grease on pots and pans should be scraped off into waste grease bucket.
      4.   Other kitchen practices identified by the village of Fox Lake or the
facility, connector communities or sanitation district and/or facility which
will decrease the point source discharge of fats, oil, grease and/or admissible
wastes.
If the sewer department finds through inspections of the collection system that
the implemented BMPs are not successful at the facility and the facility
continues to contribute significant amounts of fats, oil, grease and/or
admissible wastes to the collection system, the owner will be required to
install an adequately sized grease interceptor as outlined in this policy
within six (6) months after being notified.
   H.   Request For Variance: If a facility that is required to install a
grease interceptor finds and documents by a licensed plumber that the facility
cannot meet the minimum requirements for a grease interceptor, that facility
may submit in writing a variance request. This request must explain the
situation, which makes the minimum requirement unachievable, along with an
alternative plan for FOG and/or admissible waste reduction. Limited funding is
not an acceptable request for a variance. This request must be submitted to the
village of Fox Lake pretreatment department within thirty (30) days of the
order to install a grease interceptor.
If a facility believes that the pumping/cleaning schedule should be decreased
the facility must submit in writing a variance request. This request must
include a statement from the grease removal company that the facility has pump/
clean their interceptor. The request must also state the frequency the facility
feels would be adequate.
No changes to any portion of the FOG policy can be changed until the facility
receives from the village a written letter either accepting, accepting with
conditions or denying the variance request. The facility must abide by the
terms the village specifies.
   I.   Penalties And Fees: The penalties, fines and/or fees associated with
noncompliance with this fats, oil and grease discharge policy or portions of
the pretreatment ordinance may be at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per
violation per day in order to maintain compliance with special condition eight
of the village's NPDES permit.
The inspection fees associated with compliance with the FOG policy are as
follows:
 
Activity                                 Fee
Any facility that requires the           $150.00 per inspection (in excess of 1
Pretreatment Department to inspect the   annually)
facility more than once in 12 months
Any facility that is mandated to install
a grease interceptor in accordance with  $150.00 per inspection
this policy shall need an inspection by
the Village Plumbing Inspector
 
All fines, fees and compliance orders must be paid in full or satisfied before
any new or renewal of business license application will be approved. The
Village has the right to revoke any business license for a facility (within Fox
Lake), which has an outstanding balance or an unresolved compliance order.
If business license renewal occurs within a compliance schedule a temporary
license may be issued until the final compliance date.
Compliance status shall be reviewed annually, at the time of business license
renewal. All fines, fees and compliance orders must be paid in full or
satisfied before applications will be approved. No license shall be issued to a
facility with an outstanding balance.
The above penalties, fines and/or fees may be assessed by the Director of the
POTW. If a person or company against whom a penalty, fine or fee is assessed
under this FOG discharge policy disputes the assessment of the penalty, fine or
fee and notifies the POTW in writing of the basis for the dispute within thirty
(30) days after assessment of the penalty, fine or fee, then the Director of
the POTW may adjust the penalty, fine or fee if sufficient cause exists to do
so. If the Director of the POTW does not believe the penalty, fine or fee
should be adjusted, then he shall deliver copies of the original assessment
notice and the notice of dispute to the Village Administrator or someone
designated by the Village Administrator of the Village Board within fourteen
(14) days after the notice of dispute. The Village Administrator or someone
designated by the Village Administrator shall thereafter schedule a public
hearing before the Village Administrator or someone designated by the Village
Administrator, which hearing shall be scheduled for no later than thirty (30)
days after the notice of dispute has been received by the Village Administrator
or someone designated by the Village Administrator. The person or company
against whom the penalty, fine or fee has been assessed shall be given at least
fourteen (14) days' written notice of the hearing. The purpose of the hearing
shall be to review the decision of the Director of the POTW assessing the
penalty, fine or fee, and the decision of a majority of the Village
Administrator or someone designated by the Village Administrator shall be
final.
   J.   Best Management Practices (BMP) Plan: Food service establishments are
required to develop, implement and maintain BMP plans that include, but are not
limited to:
      1.   Proper storage of unused cooking oil;

matters for the company, a new written authorization satisfying the
requirements of section
7-3-1 must be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator prior to or together
with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
   D.   Review Of Permit Applications: The pretreatment coordinator will
evaluate the data furnished by the user in the wastewater discharge permit
application and may require additional information. Incomplete or inaccurate
applications will not be processed and will be returned to the user for
revision. After evaluation of all data furnished by the user, the pretreatment
coordinator will determine whether to issue a wastewater discharge permit
within ninety (90) calendar days of receipt of a complete permit application.
No temporary permits will be issued. If the pretreatment coordinator fails to
act within ninety (90) calendar days, a request for permit shall be deemed to
be denied.
   E.   Permit Conditions: Wastewater discharge permits shall be expressly
subject to all provisions of this article and other applicable regulations,
user charges, and fees established by the village.
      1.   Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirements: Permits shall contain, as

and standards for tests based on federal, state, and local law.
         h.   Compliance schedule when necessary.
         i.   Requirements for submission of technical reports, discharge
reports or certification statements. These include any reporting requirements
contained in a national categorical standard, 40 CFR 403.12, or this article.
         j.   Requirements for collecting/retaining and providing access to all
plant records relating to the user's discharge and for providing entry for
sampling and inspection of facilities.
         k.   Requirements for prompt notification of any new introduction of
wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of
the wastewater being introduced into the wastewater treatment system in
advance.
         l.   Requirements for notification of spills, slug loadings (as
defined herein), upsets, or other violations that could have the potential to
cause a problem at the POTW.
         m.   Requirements to develop and implement spill and slug control

      2.   Change In Conditions: In the event the type, quantity or volume of
wastewater from the property for which a wastewater discharge permit was
previously granted is expected to materially and substantially change as
reasonably determined by the permittee or pretreatment coordinator, the
permittee previously granted such permit shall give thirty (30) days' notice in
writing to the pretreatment coordinator prior to said change. No permittee
shall materially or substantially change the type, quantity or volume of its
wastewater beyond that allowed by its permit without prior approval by the
pretreatment coordinator.
      3.   Duration: Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a
specific time period not to exceed five (5) years. The permittee shall file an

expiration of the user's permit. The industrial user shall apply, on a form
provided by the village, for reissuance of the permit.
      4.   Modification: The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject
to modification by the pretreatment coordinator during the term of the permit
as limitations or requirements identified in sections
7-3A-11 through
7-3A-21 of this article are modified or other just cause exists. Where the
national categorical pretreatment standards are modified by a removal allowance
(40 CFR 403.7), or the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR 403.0(e)), or net/
gross calculations (40 CFR 403.15) or fundamentally different factor variance
for nontoxics (40 CFR 403.13), of the general pretreatment regulations, the
limits as modified shall be made a part of the wastewater discharge permit and
shall be adjusted consistent with USEPA guidelines and regulations. The permit
holder shall be notified of any proposed changes to their permit at least
thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the change. When a change is
made to a significant industrial user's permit, a reasonable time period as
determined by the pretreatment coordinator shall be given the significant
industrial user to achieve compliance. Reasonable time required that a
significant industrial user act in good faith to achieve compliance is by the
shortest possible schedule.
      5.   Transfer: Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user
for the process activity specified in the permit. A wastewater discharge permit
shall not be assigned, transferred or sold to a new owner or new user in
different premises or to a new or changed operation in the same or different
premises without the approval of the pretreatment coordinator. If the premises
are sold or otherwise transferred by the permittee to a new owner who will
maintain the operation in the same premises, then the permit held by the seller
may be reissued by the pretreatment coordinator to the new owner as a short
term permit and shall expire within ninety (90) days from the date of
reissuance. The new owner shall apply for permit, on a form established by the
village. The village shall have the same remedies for violations of short term
permits as it has for violations of other discharge permits.
      6.   A wastewater discharge permit may contain the process for seeking a
waiver from monitoring for a pollutant neither present nor expected to be
present in the discharge in accordance with section 7-3A-24C6. Any grant of the
monitoring waiver by the pretreatment coordinator shall be included as a
condition of the user’s permit. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2010-03, 1-
26-2010; Ord. 2011-18, 6-28-2011; Ord. 2015-08, 1-27-2015; Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-
2021)
7-3A-24: DENIAL OF PERMIT AND APPEAL PROCEDURE:
   A.   No wastewater discharge permit shall be issued by the pretreatment
coordinator to any person or industrial user whose discharge of material to
sewers, whether shown by permit application or determined by inspection and/or
sampling as conducted by the village, is not in conformity with any village
ordinances or regulations, or whose application is incomplete, or does not
comply with the requirements of subsection
7-3A-23B of this article. The pretreatment coordinator shall state the reason
or reasons for denial in writing, which shall be mailed or personally delivered
to the applicant within ten (10) days after denial of the permit application.
   B.   If the pretreatment coordinator refuses to grant or grants with
conditions a wastewater discharge permit under sections
7-3A-22 through
7-3A-28 of this article, the applicant may, within thirty five (35) days,
petition for a hearing before the board of trustees to contest the decision by
the pretreatment coordinator. The board of trustees shall review the permit
application, the written denial or permit conditions and such other evidence
and matters as the applicant and POTW director shall present. The decision of
the board of trustees shall be final. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2010-
03, 1-26-2010; Ord. 2015-08, 1-27-2015; Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-25: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMITTEES:
   A.   Baseline Monitoring Report:
      1.   Industrial users subject to permitting of national categorical
pretreatment standards shall submit a baseline monitoring report to the village
in a form as prescribed and furnished by the village.
      2.   Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a
national categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days
after the final administrative decision made upon a categorical determination
submission in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later,
industrial users which are existing sources subject to such national
categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to the POTW shall
submit a properly completed baseline monitoring report.
      3.   New sources, that are significant industrial users subsequent to the
promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit a baseline
monitoring report at least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge
to the POTW, in a form as prescribed by the village. New sources are also
required to include information on pretreatment methods they intend to use, and
provide data on production, flow and amounts of regulated pollutants.
      4.   In support of the baseline monitoring report, the industrial user
shall submit, in units and terms specified in the application, the following
information:
         a.   Name and address of the facility including the name of the
operator and owners.
         b.   List of any environmental control permits held by or for the
facility.
         c.   Brief description of the nature, average rate of production
(including each product produced by type, amount, processes, and rate of
production), and standard industrial classification (SIC) code of the operation
(s) carried out by such user. This description shall include a schematic
diagram indicating points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated
processes.
         d.   Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily
flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following:
            (1)   Regulated process streams, and
            (2)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 CFR section 403.6(e).
         e.   The industrial user shall identify the national categorical
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process and shall:
            (1)   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the
pretreatment coordinator of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentrations (or mass,
where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations. In cases where the standard requires a best management practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as
required by the pretreatment coordinator or the applicable standard to
determine compliance with the standard.
            (2)   Grab samples must be used for temperature, pH, total phenol,
oil and grease, sulfide, cyanide and volatile organics. For all other
pollutants, twenty four (24) hour composite samples must be obtained through
flow proportional sampling. The control authority may waive flow proportional
sampling for any industrial user who demonstrates that flow proportional
sampling is infeasible. In such cases samples may be obtained through time
proportional sampling (generally a sample every 15 minutes) with a minimum of
four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
            (3)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
section
7-3A-26D.
            (4)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection
A4e.
            (5)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream
formula of 40 CFR section 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the
pretreatment standards. Where alternate concentration of mass limit has been
calculated in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.6(e), this adjusted limit
along with supporting data shall be submitted to the village.
            (6)   The pretreatment coordinator may allow the submission of a
baseline monitoring report which utilizes only historical data, so long as the
data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
            (7)   Provide for each report the time, date, and place, of
sampling and methods of analysis and certification that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         f.   The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to be a
qualified professional, indicating whether national categorical pretreatment
standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional
operations and maintenance (O&M) measures or additional pretreatment is
required for the industrial user to meet the national categorical pretreatment
standards.
         g.   If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet
national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user will provide
the shortest possible schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment
or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable national categorical
pretreatment standards.
            (1)   Where the industrial user's national categorical pretreatment
standards have been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7) or the
combined waste stream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)), or net/gross calculations (40
CFR 403.15), at the time the industrial user submits a baseline monitoring
report the information required in subsection A4f of this section and this
subsection A4g shall pertain to the modified limits.
            (2)   If the national categorical pretreatment standard for the
industrial user is modified after the baseline monitoring report is submitted,
the industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided
as a response to subsection A4f of this section and this subsection A4g, and
submit them to the village within sixty (60) days after the modified limit is
approved.
         h.   Documentation that best management practices (BMPs) have been
implemented.
         i.   All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with subsection
7-3A-23C of this article.
         j.   Compliance Schedule Progress Report: The following conditions
shall apply to any schedule submitted in response to subsection A4g of this
section:
            (1)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet applicable national categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an
engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing
contract for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction, etc.).
            (2)   No increment referred to in subsection A4i(1) of this section
shall exceed nine (9) months.
            (3)   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress
report to the village including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with
the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which
it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay,
and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to
the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse
between such reports to the village.
         k.   Such other information as may be necessary, may be reasonably
requested by the pretreatment coordinator.
   B.   Compliance Data Report: Within ninety (90) days following the date for
final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a
new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the village a report indicating new production, flow and pollutant data and
the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the
regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements,
and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's
facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards. Also SIUs subject to
production based standards shall submit production data and IUs subject to
equivalent limits shall submit long term production rate data. The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, what additional user O&M or pretreatment
techniques or installations are necessary to bring the user into compliance
with the applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. This report shall
be signed and certified in accordance with subsection
7-3A-23C of this article.
   C.   Periodic Compliance Reports:
      1.   Any user subject to national categorical pretreatment standard after
the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or in the case of a new
source after commencement of the discharge into the POTW shall submit to the
village once every six (6) months by July 31 and January 31 for the previous
six (6) month period, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment
standards or by the director or by permit, a periodic compliance report
indicating the nature and concentration, of pollutants in the effluent which
are limited by such standards or by permit. In addition, results of additional
monitoring beyond the minimum required shall be included in this report. This
periodic compliance report shall include a record of daily average and daily
maximum flows for the reporting period At the discretion of the director or the
pretreatment coordinator, and in consideration of such factors as local high or
low flow rates, holiday, budget cycles, etc., the months the periodic
compliance reports are due may be altered. Sampling and analysis shall be a
representative sample during normal operation for the reporting period and
performed in accordance with 40 CFR 136. In cases where the pretreatment
standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative,
the user must submit documentation required by the pretreatment coordinator or
the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the
user.
      2.   In such cases where the village has imposed mass limitations, the
periodic compliance report shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by
pretreatment standards in the discharge from the industrial user.
      3.   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the village in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c), the
periodic compliance report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's
long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit production (or other measure of operation), the
periodic compliance report shall include the industrial user's actual average
production rate for the reporting period.
      4.   The pretreatment coordinator shall require appropriate reporting
from those industrial users with discharges that are not subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards. These significant noncategorical industrial
users shall submit to the village every six (6) months, on dates specified by
the village a periodic compliance report. The report shall contain a
description of the nature, concentration, and flow of pollutants required to be
reported by the control authority. These reports shall be based on sampling and
analysis performed during the period covering the report, and performed in
accordance with the techniques specified in 40 CFR part 136. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required
by the pretreatment coordinator or the pretreatment standard necessary to
determine the compliance status of the user.
      5.   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with subsection
7-3A-23C of this article.
      6.   Categorical Monitoring Waivers:
         a.   Authority: Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)(v) and (vi), the
village may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical
pretreatment standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling and other
technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be
present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake
water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the user.
This waiver is not available to users whose concentration standards are derived
from mass standards or production based standards. This authorization is
subject to the following conditions:
            (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined
to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharge from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
            (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than
five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the
waiver can be granted for each subsequent wastewater discharge permit.
            (3)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
         b.   Application Requirements:
            (1)   In making a demonstration that pollutant is not present, the
user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
            (2)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in
accordance with and include the certification statement in section
7-3A-23C.
            (3)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from
40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest detection level for that pollutant was used in
the analysis.
         c.   Documentation And Record Retention For CIU Monitoring Waivers:
Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the pretreatment coordinator must be
included as a condition of the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the pretreatment coordinator for three (3) years after expiration
of the waiver. Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and
will be returned to the user for revision.
         d.   Reporting Requirements: Upon approval of a monitoring waiver for
pollutants found to be not present and revision of the user's permit by the
pretreatment coordinator, the user must certify on each periodic report with
the statement section
7-3A-23C, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the user with the following statement:
            "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40 CFR ____ (specify
applicable national categorical pretreatment standard part(s)), I certify that,
to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level
of the ___________ (list the categorically regulated pollutant(s)) in the
wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last
periodic report."
      7.   Non-significant categorical industrial users as defined in section
7-3-1 shall, at a frequency determined by the pretreatment coordinator but no
less frequently than annually (on dates specified by the village) submit a
report which contains the certification statement contained below.
   "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the Categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR
      , I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that during the
period from                ,        to                     ,            
(months, days, year):
      a)   The facility described as                    (facility name) met the
definition of a non-significant categorical industrial user as described by
section 7-3-1;
      b)   The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements during this reporting period; and
      c)   The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting period.
      This compliance certification is based on the following information:
       “
   The report is required to be signed by an authorized representative of the
user.
   D.   Hazardous Waste Notification:
      1.   Any IU, except as specified in subsection E of this section, which
discharges to the POTW any substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be
a listed or characteristic hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261, shall notify the
village, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state
hazardous waste authorities in writing of such discharge.
      2.   All hazardous waste notifications shall include:
         a.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261.
         b.   The EPA hazardous waste number.
         c.   The type of discharge (batch, continuous, or other).
         d.   A certification that the user has a program in place to reduce
the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
      3.   In addition to the hazardous waste notification described above, IUs
discharging more than one hundred (100) kilograms of hazardous waste per
calendar month to the POTW shall report to the village to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user, the following:
         a.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
waste.
         b.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month.
         c.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the waste stream to be discharged during the following twelve (12) calendar
months.
      4.   Hazardous waste notification must take place no later than one
hundred eighty (180) days from the discharge of such wastes. Any notification
under this provision needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharge. Modifications or changed discharge notifications must still be
submitted under subsection
7-3A-18D4 of this article. This notification requirement in this section does
not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections
7-3A-25A and
7-3A-25C1.
      5.   IUs are exempt from the hazardous waste notification requirement
during a calendar month in which they discharge fifteen (15) kilograms or less
of nonacute hazardous wastes. Discharge of any quantity of acute hazardous
waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a onetime
notification.
      6.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
pretreatment coordinator, the EPA regional waste management division director,
and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
      7.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      8.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   E.   Notice Of Changed Discharge: All industrial users shall promptly notify
the pretreatment coordinator in advance of any substantial change in the volume
or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the listed or
characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has submitted
initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p) or subsection D of this section.
      1.   The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under
section
7-3A-23 of this article.
      2.   The pretreatment coordinator may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under section
7-3A-23 of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit in
response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
      3.   For purposes of this requirement, substantial changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or greater, the
addition or deletion of a shift, the discharge of any previously unreported
pollutants including changes to the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes
for which the user has submitted initial notification under section
7-3A-25D, introduction of a pollutant for which a monitoring waiver has been
obtained, the addition of a new process regardless of waste discharge loads or
lack of discharge, shutdown of a process, or addition or deletion of a product.
   F.   Notice Of Violation/Repeat Sampling And Reporting: If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify
the control authority within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord.
2010-03, 1-26-2010; Ord. 2011-18, 6-28-2011; Ord. 2015-08, 1-27-2015; Ord.
2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-26: MONITORING FACILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Sampling Manhole Applicability:
      1.   All non-residential users shall provide, operate, and maintain at
their own expense a monitoring manhole or sampling chamber to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the building's sewer or internal drainage
system by authorized representatives of the POTW. The chamber shall be safely,
easily and independently accessible to authorized representatives of the POTW
at all times. The monitoring facility will normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the village may, when such a location is impractical and could
cause undue hardship to the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area; located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activities of the user.
         a.   When required by the village, a categorical industrial user shall
install a monitoring manhole or sampling chamber for use as the regulation
location of the categorically regulated discharge in the building sewer in
accordance with plans and specifications approved by the village. This sampling
chamber may be required to be installed within the building and may be in
addition to an end-of-pipe manhole.
         b.   Where required by the village, additional manholes or sampling
chambers shall be provided at each end of each industrial process within an
industrial user's facility suitable for the determination of compliance with
the pretreatment standards.
      2.   The village reserves the right to apply said local limits in section
7-3A-13A and B at an end-of-process discharge location that connects to the
POTW sewer system in the event that:
         a.   A unique sampling manhole at end-of-pipe is not available;
         b.   A more representative sample can be taken of a process batch
discharge even though an end-of-pipe manhole exists;
         c.   A more representative sample can be taken at the end-of-process
location than the end-of-pipe location as a result of impacts from dilute
wastestreams;
         d.   An end-of-process location is used because the IU is unable to
provide adequate flow documentation to use a combined wastestream formula.
      3.   In the event that a suitable sampling manhole does not exist and no
end-of-process discharge sampling location exists, the "temporary sampling
facility" shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
      4.   The sampling chamber, metering device, and documentation of the
sampling frequencies, sampling methods, and analysis of samples shall be
subject, at any reasonable time to inspection and verification by a
representative of the POTW.
      5.   Each sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus flume unless a
weir or similar device is approved by the pretreatment coordinator. The flume
or weir shall be equipped with a recording and totalizing register for
measurement of liquid quantity discharged to the POTW. At the discretion of the
pretreatment coordinator the metered water supply to the industrial plant may
be used as the liquid quantity discharged to the POTW, where it can be
substantiated to the POTW that the metered water supply and the quantity
discharged to the POTW are approximately the same.
      6.   When required by the pretreatment coordinator, the significant
industrial user shall install and maintain, at its own expense, a flow
recording device with a seven (7) day flow indicating and totalizing feature
(i.e., "Control Electronics model PDS 300" or equivalent), designed for open
channel recording. The flow recording device shall be calibrated annually.
      7.   When required, samples shall be taken in accordance with the
analytical procedures stated in 40 CFR part 136 or an equivalent method
approved by the EPA. All sampling must be representative of the user's
discharge and shall be performed in accordance with the user's wastewater
discharge permit.
   B.   Wastewater Monitoring And/Or Flow Measurement Facility Operation And
Maintenance:
      1.   Such facilities will be installed and maintained at all times at the
user's expense. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that the sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
      2.   The manhole or chamber located on a building sewer discharge located
in dedicated easements shall be easily accessible to representatives of the
village twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.
      3.   The manhole or chamber at a discharge location within the building
shall be accessible to representatives of the village during normal user
operating hours.
      4.   Metered water supply may be used to determine wastewater flow if it
is substantiated to the village that the metered water supply and wastewater
quantities are approximately the same, or where an adjustment agreed to by the
village is made in the metered water supply to determine wastewater flow which
is documented through the use of sub-meters and/or production records.
      5.   The sampling chamber, flow metering device, sampling equipment and
documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analysis of
samples shall be subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection by the village.
   C.   When periodic sampling is required by a wastewater discharge permit,
the permittee shall pay the costs of sampling its discharge and the costs of
the analysis of its samples. The fees associated with sampling and analysis
shall be as stated in the user's wastewater discharge permit.
   D.   All measurements, tests, analytical procedures, and sampling methods
which are referenced in this article shall be determined and performed in
accordance with the procedures established by the administrator of the United
States EPA pursuant to section 304(g) of the act and contained in 40 CFR part
136, and amendments thereto, or any other procedure approved by the
administrator. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the administrator
determines that part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate
for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed using
validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures,
including those suggested by the pretreatment coordinator, other parties
approved by the administrator.
   E.   When required by the pretreatment coordinator the industrial user shall
install and maintain at its own expense, a stationary refrigerated sampler
capable of flow proportional sampling. This requirement shall apply when
continued violations to the conditions of sections
7-3A-11 through
7-3A-21 of this article or of the wastewater discharge permit occur. "Continued
violations" shall be defined as more than two (2) within a twelve (12) month
period. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2010-03, 1-26-2021; Ord. 2021-08,
4-27-2021)
7-3A-27: INSPECTION, SAMPLING AND RECORDS KEEPING:
   A.   The pretreatment coordinator, duly authorized representatives of the
village, IEPA and USEPA shall have the authority to inspect the facilities of
all industrial users to determine whether the purposes of this article and any
wastewater discharge permit are being complied with. Persons or occupants of
the premises in which a discharge source or pretreatment system is located or
in which records are kept, shall allow the pretreatment coordinator, duly
authorized representatives of the village, IEPA, USEPA or its representatives
ready access upon presentation of credentials, at reasonable times, to all
parts of said premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination of
and photocopying of records required to be kept by this article.
      1.   When an industrial user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance or the wearing of special
protective gear before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make
necessary arrangements at its own expense with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the authorized representatives of
the village, IEPA and USEPA will be permitted to enter and inspect the premises
without delay. When suitable identification is necessary to enter the premises
of an industrial user, such arrangements shall be made by those industrial
users with their security force within thirty (30) days of the passage of this
article.
      2.   The pretreatment coordinator, duly authorized representative of the
village, IEPA and USEPA shall also have the authority to sample industrial
users to determine whether the pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis. The pretreatment coordinator, duly authorized representative
of the village, IEPA and USEPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial
user's property or require installation of such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, monitoring and metering operations.
      3.   The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated once a year to ensure their
accuracy. The user shall submit these calibration reports semi-annually to the
village with the periodic compliance reports.
      4.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the pretreatment coordinator and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
      5.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the pretreatment coordinator, duly
authorized representative of the village, IEPA and USEPA access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this article.
   B.   Industrial users and the pretreatment coordinator shall maintain
records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by
this article and shall include:
      1.   The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the names of
persons taking the samples. The chain of custody record must be maintained for
each separate sampling;
      2.   The dates analyses were performed;
      3.   Who performed the analyses;
      4.   The analytical method/techniques used; and
      5.   The results of such analyses.
   C.   Users shall maintain and make available for inspection and copying upon
request of authorized representatives of the village, IEPA or USEPA, all
records required to be collected by the user pursuant to this article or the
wastewater discharge permit or any other permit issued or associated with best
management practices established in section
7-3A-13H. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
(3) years after their collection. This period shall be automatically extended
for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or village, or where the
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
pretreatment coordinator. When an industrial user monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required, using the appropriate procedures, the results shall
be included in its reporting, and be made available upon request.
   D.   All analyses, including sampling results, submitted in support of any
application, reports, evidence or required by any permit or order shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and
amendments thereto, or if 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, in accordance with
techniques approved by the EPA. At all times the minimum detection limit must
be at or below the most stringent of limits (federal, state or local discharge
limits). (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-28: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs or from inspections shall
be made available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests by stamping the words "confidential business information"
on each page containing such data and is able to demonstrate to the village
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or
methods of production entitled to protection as industrial trade secrets of the
user under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time
of submission of the information or data. When such a claim is asserted, the
information shall be treated as such until a determination is made by the
village.
When the person furnishing the information satisfies the village that such
information furnished should remain confidential because of the disclosure of
trade secrets or secret processes, the information provided shall not be made
available except upon request by the state or EPA for uses related to this
article, the NPDES permit or the pretreatment program. Confidential portions of
a report shall be made available for use by state or EPA in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined
by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be
available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd.
Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES AND PENALTIES
7-3A-29: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT RESPONSES:
   A.   Notification Of Violation: Whenever the pretreatment coordinator finds
that any industrial user has violated or is violating this article, or a
wastewater permit, or order issued hereunder, the director or his agent may
serve upon said user written notification of the violation. Within twenty (20)
days of the receipt of notification an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted to the director or his agent. Submission
of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation (NOV).
   B.   Consent Orders: The director is hereby empowered to enter into consent
orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with the industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such
orders will include compliance schedules, stipulated fines or remedial actions,
and signatures of the director or his agent, and industry representatives.
Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as subsections D and E of
this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
   C.   Show Cause Order: The director may order any user which causes or
contributes to violations of this article, a wastewater permit or order issued
hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner
or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as
noticed, enforcement action may be pursued as appropriate.
   D.   Compliance Order: When the director finds that an industrial user has
violated or continues to violate this article or a wastewater permit, or order
issued hereunder, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for
the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service
shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated, and,
compliance is achieved. Orders may also contain other requirements as might be
reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including
the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and
management practices. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   E.   Cease And Desist Orders: When the director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this article or a wastewater
discharge permit, or any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to
recur, the director may issue an order to cease and desist all illegal or
authorized discharges immediately.
      1.   In an emergency, the cease and desist order may be given by
telephone.
      2.   In nonemergency situations, the cease and desist order may be used
to suspend or permanently revoke the industrial user's wastewater discharge
permit.
      3.   The cease and desist order may order the IU to take such appropriate
remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and
terminating discharge.
   F.   Administrative Fines:
      1.   Notwithstanding any other section of the enforcement response plan
(ERP) or this article, any user who is found to have violated any provision of
this article, or wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, may be
fined at the discretion of the director in an amount of at least one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each violation as outlined in the federal
regulations. Each day on which a violation occurs or continues to occur, shall
be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Unpaid charges, fines, and
penalties shall constitute a lien against the user's property. Industrial users
desiring to dispute such fines must file a request with the director within ten
(10) days of being notified of the fine. Where the director believes a request
has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen (15) days of
receiving the request from the industrial user. Violations potentially
warranting a minimum one thousand dollar ($1,000.00) fine include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         a.   Contributing any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere
with the operation or performance of the POTW or will pass through the POTW
(subsection
7-3A-12B of this article).
         b.   Failure to provide immediate notification of a spill or slug load
(subsection
7-3A-18B1 of this article).
         c.   Failure to adhere to the requirements of a compliance order
(subsection D of this section).
         d.   Failure to submit a hazardous waste notification (subsection
7-3A-25D of this article).
         e.   Failure to notify pretreatment coordinator of a self-monitoring
violation (subsection
7-3A-25F of this article).
         f.   Failure to provide notification of changed discharge (subsection
7-3A-25E of this article).
         g.   Failure to submit baseline monitoring report (subsection
7-3A-25A of this article).
         h.   Failure to submit periodic compliance report (subsection
7-3A-25C of this article).
         i.   Failure to document and perform grease interceptor maintenance
(subsection
7-3A-19E of this article).
   G.   Suspension Of Permit In Emergency Situations:
      1.   The director may suspend the wastewater discharge permit and/or
service of an industrial user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge, presenting or causing, an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW or the
environment.
      2.   Any user notified of a suspension of its wastewater discharge permit
or service shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event
of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The director
shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in subsection H of this
section are initiated against the user.
      3.   An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrences to the director prior to the judicial remedies described following.
      4.   Except in emergency situations, noncomplying industrial users will
be notified of the proposed suspension of their wastewater discharge permit and
offered the opportunity to show cause under subsection C of this section as to
why the proposed suspension should not take place.
   H.   Termination Of Permit: Significant industrial users proposing to
discharge into the POTW must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from
the NWRWRF. Any user who violates the conditions of this article or a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any applicable state
or federal law, is subject to permit termination. The following violations are
cause for permit termination:
      1.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      2.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
      4.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, sampling, or monitoring;
      5.   Tampering with, disrupting, or destroying POTW equipment;
      6.   Failure to report an accidental discharge of a pollutant;
      7.   Failure to report an upset of the industrial user's treatment
facilities.
      Except in emergency situations, noncomplying industrial users will be
notified of the proposed suspension of their wastewater discharge permit and
offered the opportunity to show cause under subsection C of this section, as to
why the proposed suspension should not take place.
   I.   Revocation Of Business License: The village of Fox Lake may revoke any
business license issued to any business within Fox Lake if any fines or fees
are not paid in a timely manner. The village of Fox Lake also has the right to
revoke any business license from any facility within the village of Fox Lake if
any compliance orders or mandates issued under this chapter are not met within
the scheduled time frame. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2010-03, 1-26-
2010; Ord. 2011-18, 6-28-2011; Ord. 2015-08, 1-27-2015; Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-
2021)
7-3A-30: JUDICIAL RESPONSES:
If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the
wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this article or any
other permit or order issued hereunder, the director, through the village
attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or other equitable
relief in the circuit court of Lake County.
   A.   Injunctive Relief: Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, its wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the director, through counsel may petition the court for the
issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action
as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement
for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.
   B.   Civil Penalties:
      1.   Any industrial user who has violated or continues to violate the
pretreatment ordinance or its wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to
the village for a civil penalty at the discretion of the director, in the
amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) plus actual damages incurred by the
village per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In the
case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall
accrue for each day during the period of the violation. In addition to the
above described penalty, the village may also recover reasonable attorney fees,
court costs, and any other applicable expenses associated with the enforcement
activities including sampling, monitoring and inspections.
      2.   The director shall petition the court to impose, assess, and recover
such sums. In determining amount of liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic
benefit gained through the industrial user's violation, corrective actions by
the industrial user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      3.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-
2005; amd. Ord. 2010-03, 1-26-2010; Ord. 2015-08, 1-27-2015; Ord. 2011-18, 6-
28-2011; Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-31: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
The village will request assistance from IEPA and USEPA Criminal Investigation
Division for assistance with criminal prosecution for any industrial user who
willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, of a
wastewater discharge permit, or any order issued. (Ord. 2005-10, 3-15-2005;
amd. Ord. 2006-34, 8-22-2006; Ord. 2011-18, 6-28-2011; Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-32: ANNUAL PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The director shall publish, at least annually in newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of those industrial users which are found to be in
"significant noncompliance", as defined in section
7-3-1 of this chapter, or any provision of this article or any permit, or order
issued hereunder, during the period since the previous publication. (Ord. 2005-
10, 3-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2010-03, 1-26-2010; Ord. 2015-08, 1-27-2015; Ord.
2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-33: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
   A.   Upset:
      1.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of paragraph 3, below, are met.
      3.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         a.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         b.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         c.   The user has submitted the following information to the
pretreatment coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
upset (if this information is provided orally, a written report must be
provided within five (5) working days):
            (1)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            (2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            (3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      5.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      6.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   B.   Prohibited Discharge Standards:
      1.   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section
7-3A-12A or the specific prohibitions in sections
7-3A-12C1-27 (excluding paragraphs C2, C6 and C16) of this article if it can
prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone
or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through
or interference or that either:
         a.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or
         b.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the village was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal
requirements.
   C.   Bypass:
      1.   For the purposes of this section:
         a.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
         b.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      2.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of subsections 3 and 4 of this section.
      3.   Bypass Notifications:
         a.   Anticipated: If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the pretreatment coordinator, at least ten (10)
working days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
         b.   Unanticipated: A user shall submit oral notice to the
pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes
aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five
(5) working days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The pretreatment coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case
basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
      4.   POTW Actions:
         a.   Bypass is prohibited, and the pretreatment coordinator may take
an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            (3)   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph 3 of
this section.
         b.   The pretreatment coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the pretreatment coordinator
determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph 4a of
this section. (Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-2021)
7-3A-34: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The pretreatment
coordinator may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with village's enforcement response plan. However, the pretreatment
coordinator may take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the pretreatment coordinator is empowered to take more than
one enforcement action against any non-compliant user. (Ord. 2021-08, 4-27-
2021)

Notes
1 1. See section 6-1-1-2 of this code.
7-4-3: CONNECTION WHEN FACILITIES AVAILABLE:
   A.   It shall be the duty of the owner, occupant or person in possession of
any house, structure, factory, industrial or commercial establishment or any
building of any character to be connected with the water system within sixty
(60) days from the date water facilities become available to such property or
from the date on which the Village Board of Trustees notifies an owner,
occupant, or person in possession that a connection has been determined
necessary. For purposes of this chapter, water facilities shall be deemed to be
available to a property when a water main is located in the road right-of-way
or in an easement adjacent to such property; provided, however, as follows:
      1.   If the location of the water main and the physical characteristics
of the terrain or improvements between the water main and the property line of
a residential property owner create an extreme hardship upon the property
owner, then the Village Board may grant a variance to allow the property owner
to continue to use the existing well on the property subject to subsections A2
and A3 of this section.
      2.   The property owner shall file a letter with the Village Clerk
requesting the variance and identifying all aspects of the alleged hardship and
the Village Board shall either grant or deny the variance by motion and issue a
letter confirming its decision.
      3.   Any decision granting a variance shall contain a provision that: a)
if the well on the affected property requires replacement or major repair of a
cost of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more, or b) if the Village causes
the water main or a service pipe to be installed which cures the hardship, then
the variance shall no longer apply. The decision may also impose other
restrictions in the discretion of the Village Board.
   B.   Whenever the owner of any house, residential structure, factory, or
industrial or commercial building located within two hundred feet (200') of an
existing water main is required to make any maintenance, repair, replacement or
modification to an existing private well in order to maintain compliance with
the County Health Department requirements, seeks Village and/or County approval
for the installation of a new private well, or seeks connection to the
Village's water system, then such owner shall be obligated to connect to the
Village's water system if the Village elects to install a main from the
existing main to the property line of such owner's building, and the Village
obtains all permits required for such installation. If the Village elects to
install such main, then such owner shall be obligated to pay the following
costs in addition to a normal connection fee: 1) the estimated cost (as
certified by the Village Engineer) for the owner to install a water service
line from such owner's property line to the existing main and 2) any costs
incurred to upsize the water main to be installed as a result of such owner's
water requirements.
   C.   1.   A community association may petition for a variance for purposes
of installing or repairing a well to be strictly used for irrigation purposes.
Any decision granting a variance for such an irrigation well shall contain a
provision that: a) the petitioner shall not construct or modify a water well,
irrigation well, or a closed loop well or seal a well without prior approval of
the County Health Department; b) no person shall operate an irrigation well
without registering the irrigation well with the County Health Department; c) a
legal document is to be submitted that clearly establishes any required
easements for the location of the water well and or water lines, the costs and
obligations for the upkeep and maintenance of the water system, the
continuation of the agreement for new property owners and any other special
conditions unique to the affected properties. The document shall be recorded
with the affected properties with the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds.
      2.   The petitioner shall file a letter with the Village Clerk requesting
the variance and identifying all reasons why such an irrigation well is
required by the community association.
   D.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each user of the
Village's water system shall have its own separate connection to a Village
owned water main, and each user shall be responsible for its own connection fee
and user fee.
   E.   Any owner, occupant or party or parties in possession of any house,
structure, factory, industrial or commercial establishment or any other
building of any other character not complying with the terms of this section
shall be subject to a penalty of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more
than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) and to an additional penalty of not
less than fifty dollars ($50.00) for each day such property does not comply
with the terms of this section. (Ord. 2010-02, 1-26-2010; amd. Ord. 2013-20, 9-
24-2013; Ord. 2015-04, 1-13-2015; Ord. 2019-24, 6-11-2019; Ord. 2024-03, 1-23-
2024)
7-4-4: CONNECTION FEES:
   A.   No connection with a water main shall be made prior to payment of the
water connection tap-on fee, issuance of a permit and twenty four (24) hours'
notice having been given to the Village Building Department. All such
connections shall be made under the supervision of said Village Building
Department and no connection shall be covered until the work has been inspected
by the Village Building Department.
   B.   Any connection or opening made with the water system without such
permit or in any manner different from the mode described for such opening or
connection shall subject the maker to a penalty of not less than fifty dollars
($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00), and to an
additional penalty of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) for each day such
opening or connection shall remain without such permit.
   C.    1.   All new public water users connecting to the Village water system
(IL 0970200) shall pay a water connection tap-on fee of two thousand nine
hundred dollars ($2,900.00) per residential customer equivalent. This fee is
intended to reimburse the Village for a portion of the water system previously
created by the Village with which the user now seeks to connect. If water
service to a property has been disconnected either because of nonpayment of
user fees or at the request of the owner of the property, and a subsequent
owner of the property requests reconnection, then such subsequent owner shall
be considered to be a new public water user under this section and a new
connection fee shall be required.
      2.   Each residential dwelling unit shall be considered to be one
residential customer equivalent, whether it be in a single-family building or
in a building with multiple dwelling units.
      3.   For purposes of establishing the water connection fee for commercial
buildings, the residential customer equivalent of commercial buildings shall be
determined by a mathematical formula (Coef x GPD per capita)/250 = RCE, using
the schedule contained in subsection
7-3-6C of this title and utilizing the assumption that average daily water use
is equivalent to average daily sewer load; provided, however, that water
connection tap-on fees shall be assessed at two thousand nine hundred dollars
($2,900.00) for the first estimated RCE and one thousand dollars ($1,000.00)
for each RCE or part thereof thereafter (with a minimum fee of $2,900.00). If
the initial use is unknown at the time of connection or if the initial use is
not contained on said schedule, then the residential customer equivalent shall
be estimated by the Village Engineer or his or her designee by using a
coefficient of 0.1 per square foot of space and applying the above formula. In
the event that the actual first use of all or a portion of a multi-unit
commercial building is such that a greater connection fee than estimated is
warranted, then the increased connection fee amount shall be paid prior to a
business license being issued for such first actual use.
      4.   For purposes of establishing the water connection fee for industrial
buildings, the industrial connection fee will be determined by the Village
Engineer or his or her designee by estimating the water usage for a specific
industrial use converted to residential customer equivalents based on two
hundred fifty (250) gallons per day per residential customer equivalent.
      5.   For any commercial or industrial user whose water usage materially
exceeds the usage represented in an application for sewer connection, such
commercial or industrial user shall be required to pay a supplemental
connection fee based on average actual water usage. No refunds of portions of
connection fees shall be made if actual use is less than the usage upon which
the connection fee was based.   
      6.   In addition to said water connection fee, there shall be charged a
meter installation and inspection fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
service installation.
      7.   In the discretion of the Village, connections to the Village’s water
system may be made by users lying outside the limits of the Village but no such
connections shall be made unless the user agrees in writing to be bound by the
Village’s ordinances on water, a suitable user fee is paid by the user, the
above connection fees are paid by the user, and all costs of connection
including charges of the Village Engineer or his or her designee and upgrades
to the Village’s system needed to accommodate the new user are paid for by the
user.
      8.   In instances where an existing water user requires additional
capacity, a new connection may be made to the Village’s water system for a
larger service line or a fire suppression system and the fee structure for such
connections shall be according to the following chart:
 
2" tap or less      $ 650.00
3" tap or less      850.00
4" tap or less      1,000.00
Greater than 4" tap 1,400.00
 
   All other provisions of this section shall apply to such connections in
addition to the above connection fee chart.
   D.   The owner of property to whom the Village’s water facilities become
available by extension of the Village’s water mains, and who has an economic
hardship, may elect to pay the connection fee in installments under the
following provisions of this subsection D:
      1.   Within sixty (60) days after notice that the Village’s water
facilities have become available to such owner, such owner shall request in
writing that such owner be permitted to pay the water connection fee in
installments.
      2.   Such request shall be made on a form provided by the Village, shall
be signed by all owners of record of the property in question, and shall be
accompanied by the following:
         a.   Copy of most recent title policy or deed for the property showing
owners of record;
         b.   Copy of most recent tax bills for the property;
         c.   Nonrefundable deposit in the amount of one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00) to cover the cost of a tract search on the property; and
         d.   Statement of the reason for the request to pay the connection fee
in installments due to an economic hardship.
   3.   The Finance Director shall reject or approve such request within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the request of such owner, and if rejected, the
Finance Director shall specify the reason for rejection. Reasons for rejection
may include the following items: lack of creditworthiness of such owner;
failure to demonstrate an economic hardship; noncompliance with other Village
ordinances; and any other criteria reasonably considered by the Village.
   4.   If the request of such owner is approved, then such owner shall, within
fourteen (14) days after approval, sign the appropriate promissory note and
lien document on forms provided by the Village and deliver them to the Village
Clerk.
   5.   Within sixty (60) days after delivery of the promissory note and lien
document to the Village, such owner shall furnish evidence that connection to
the Village main has been accomplished in accordance with the terms of this
subsection D.
   6.   Postponement of payment shall be for no more than sixty (60) months,
and regular equal monthly payments must be made. In addition, the promissory
note and lien document shall provide:
      a.   For a default rate of three percent (3%) per annum on all amounts
due after default;
      b.   For nonpayment or failure to pay user fees to be a default;
      c.   For foreclosure as in foreclosure of mortgages in the event of a
default which is uncured for more than thirty (30) days; and
      d.   That amounts past due may be added by the Village to the owner’s
water user bill, and upon nonpayment, the owner’s water service may be
terminated pursuant to the terms of this chapter.
   E.   Payment of connection fees may be deferred in the discretion of the
Village Board when such deferral may assist in development of property which
may otherwise remain undeveloped or underutilized. The following provisions
shall apply to such deferral:
      1.   Application for deferral shall be signed by all owners of the
property and by the proposed developer of the property and shall indicate the
proposed deferral period and the reasons therefor. Such application shall also
include:
         a.   Copy of current title policy or commitment for the property
showing owners of record;
         b.   Copy of most recent tax bills for the property; and
         c.   Nonrefundable deposit in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00) to cover the cost of staff review of the application.
      2.   Deferral requested may be either:
         a.   Delay in payment for a fixed period of time not to exceed thirty
six (36) months after issuance of building permits; or
         b.   Payment of the required connection fees in installments over a
period not to exceed sixty (60) months after issuance of building permits;
provided that:
            (1)   Security for one hundred five percent (105%) of the total
connection fee shall be provided for any deferral prior to issuance of building
permits in the form of cash, a letter of credit or surety bond, acceptable to
the Village Attorney;
            (2)   For deferral for a fixed period of time, interest shall be
payable on the deferred amount at the Federal funds rate or three percent (3%)
per annum, whichever is higher, from the date of building permit issuance to
the date of payment in full;
            (3)   For deferral and payment in installments, interest shall be
payable on the unpaid balance from time to time at the Federal funds rate or
three percent (3%) per annum, whichever is higher, and regular equal monthly
payments shall be required in an amount based on amortization of the connection
fee amount for the term requested, but not to exceed sixty (60) months;
            (4)   Deferral shall only be permitted for commercial or industrial
development, or multi-family real estate development of more than forty (40)
units; and
            (5)   Building permits must be issued within six (6) months after
approval of the deferral.
      3.   The Village Board shall approve or reject an application within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the complete application. If no action is
taken within that time, the application shall be deemed to be rejected.
Approval or rejection is within the sound discretion of the Village Board and
may be based on factors the Village Board deems to be relevant, including, but
not limited to: benefit of the development to the Village; effect of the
development on the Village’s water system; conformity of the development with
the Village’s Comprehensive Plan and other ordinances; and impact of the
development on surrounding properties.
      4.   If the application is approved, then prior to issuance of building
permits for the development, the owner of the property shall sign an
appropriate promissory note and recordable lien document on forms provided by
the Village. Such promissory note and lien document shall provide:
         a.   For a default rate of three percent (3%) per annum greater than
the applicable interest rate;
         b.   For nonpayment or failure to pay user fees to be a default;
         c.   For acceleration of the entire balance due after default and
foreclosure as in foreclosure of mortgages in the event of a default which is
uncured for more than thirty (30) days;
         d.   For subordination of the lien document to a mortgage required for
development of the property, if said subordination is deemed appropriate by the
Village;
         e.   For such other provisions as the Village Board requires in order
to consent to the deferral. (Ord. 2010-02, 1-26-2010; amd. Ord. 2013-20, 9-24-
2013; Ord. 2014-01, 1-28-2014; Ord. 2017-01, 1-10-2017; Ord. 2017-49, 10-24-

2024)
7-4-5: METERS:
   A.   Required, Rates: All premises, including new structures, using village
water must be supplied with an adequate meter at the property owner's cost,
provided that such water service may be supplied by the village and be billed
based upon an average water usage bill for the respective system at a flat
charge until such meter may be installed. For all multiple- family residential
structures over two (2) stories in height the owner may apply to the village
for one of two (2) options: (Ord. 2010-02, 1-26-2010; amd. Ord. 2013-20, 9-24-
2013)
      1.   If separate meters with shutoff valves are located in common areas
accessible to the village, bills for sewer and water usage shall be billed to
each residential unit.
      2.   If no separate meters with shutoff valves are located in common
areas accessible to the village, then a single meter shall be installed per
building in a location accessible to the village. Bills for sewer and water
usage shall be billed to the landowner or association and the village shall be
authorized to disconnect water service to the entire building for nonpayment of
water user charges using the procedures set forth in section
7-4-8 of this chapter.
Nothing contained in this subsection A shall be construed to eliminate the
requirement that a separate water connection tap-on fee be paid for each
dwelling unit in a multiple-unit residential building.
   B.   New Structures: Before any new structure is occupied, a water meter
shall be installed therein as herein required or application made for such
water service at the flat rate of charge until the meter can be installed, or
no water shall be furnished such premises. (Ord. 2010-02, 1-26-2010)
   C.   Installation And Type: An automatic/electronic water meter with touch
pad and radio transmitter shall be installed in a location that will be easily
accessible for the purposes of reading the meter and maintenance of meter. The
owner of any premises shall provide a location for a water meter and maintain
such location and passageway thereto clean and sanitary and free from any
obstruction or any condition hazardous in nature. No connection for water
meters shall be installed in any location not easily accessible or which is, or
may be, unclean, unsanitary, or in any manner unsafe to sewer and water
department employees in the discharge of their duties. (Ord. 2014-01, 1-28-
2014)
   D.   Owner's Expense: The meter to be installed shall be at owner's expense
and shall be an automatic/electronic water meter with touch pad and radio
transmitter as designated by the sewer and water supervisor. A conduit no less
than one- half inch (1/2") shall be installed from the water meter location to
either the gas meter or electric meter location outside of structure. All
conduits installed in multi-unit structures shall be from water meter locations
to one central location outside of structure, at either the gas meter or
electric meter location. Conduit installation shall be installed in accordance
with the national electric code.
   E.   Replacement And Testing Program: The supervisor of sewer and water
shall initiate and maintain a program to replace all residential meters after
the meters have registered nine hundred thousand (900,000) gallons. All water
and/or sewer users using a water meter who are receiving water and/or
discharging wastewater in excess of six hundred thousand (600,000) gallons per
year shall have their water/sewer meter tested for accuracy at least every two
(2) years. Except as provided in subsections F and G of this section, the sewer
and water department shall pay the cost of meter replacement, testing and
repairs, and the old meter will be the property of the village.
   F.   Care Of Meter Equipment: It is the sole responsibility of the owner of
the property to care for the water meter equipment, protect said meter from
weather related damage and from abuse or neglectful damage from occupants,
pets, remodeling and other activities.
   G.   Meter Repairs: The property owner shall bear the entire expense of all
repairs on water meters on their premises due to freezing or from any other
cause owing to the negligence of the said property owner or his tenant. The
sewer and water department shall make the repairs and the cost thereof shall be
billed at time and material to and paid by the property owner.
   H.   Reading Meters: The sewer and water supervisor or his designee shall
read or cause to be read every water meter used in the village at such times as
are necessary so that the bills may be sent out at the proper time.
   I.   Dispute Of Meter Accuracy: Upon complaint of the consumer and payment
by him of a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00), such meter shall be taken out
and factory tested. If, upon testing, the meter is not found to be within AWWA
standards for water meter accuracy, it shall be repaired or replaced and the
one hundred dollar ($100.00) fee returned to the consumer. If the meter is
found to be within AWWA standards for water meter accuracy the one hundred
dollar ($100.00) fee shall be retained by the Village. (Ord. 2010-02, 1-26-
2010)
7-4-6: WATER RATES:
   A.   Public Water Users Connected To The Fox Lake Water System (IL 0970200
and IL 0975780): Water rates for users connected to or in areas serviced by the
Fox Lake water system shall be as follows:
      1.   Metered Consumer: For each user of water service that is
individually metered there shall be charged a rate computed as follows: a fixed
cost charge of fifty-five dollars and eleven cents ($55.11) per two (2) month
period, plus a usage charge of four dollars and ten cents ($4.10) per one
thousand (1,000) gallons per two (2) month period.
      2.   Non-Metered Consumer: For each user of water service that is not
individually metered, there shall be charged a rate computed as follows: a
fixed cost charge of fifty-five dollars and eleven cents ($55.11) per two (2)
month period, plus a usage charge of four dollars and ten cents ($4.10) per one
thousand (1,000) gallons based upon an assumed average usage of eight thousand
(8,000) gallons per two (2) month period.
      3.   Multiple-Dwelling Single Metered Consumers: For multiple-dwelling
unit developments that are not individually metered but have a single meter,
there shall be charged a rate computed as follows: a fixed cost charge for each
individual dwelling unit of fifty-five dollars and eleven cents ($55.11) per
two (2) month period, plus a usage charge of four dollars and ten cents ($4.10)
per one thousand (1,000) gallons.
   B.   Non-Metered Water Users: Whenever the Supervisor of Sewer and Water
determines that a non-metered water user is consuming more than eight thousand
(8,000) gallons in a two (2) month period, the Supervisor of Sewer and Water
may require such non- metered water user to install metering devices on the

(every 2 months) basis to the owner of each residential premises connected to
the Village's water system at the address of the premises or at the owner's
address on file with the Village if the owner does not reside at the premises.
In the case of commercial premises, the owner may designate that the billing be
directed to the tenant at the address of the premises or at such other address
that the owner designates in writing. Bills for water service shall be mailed
out every two (2) months. Such bills shall be deemed delinquent if not paid
within thirty (30) days of billing date and an additional ten percent (10%)
delinquency charge shall be added to such delinquent balance.
   B.   Users: The owner of the premises connected to the Village's water
system, the occupant thereof and the user of the water service shall all be
construed to be "users" for purposes of this section and all shall be jointly
and severally liable to pay for such service to such premises, and such service
is furnished to the premises by the Village only upon the condition that the
owner of the premises, occupant and user of such service are jointly and
severally liable to the Village for all charges as set forth herein.
   C.   Delinquency Charges; Statement Of Lien: In the event the water user
service charges, including any delinquency charge then due, are not paid within
sixty (60) days after the date of billing, then an additional ten percent (10%)
delinquency charge shall be added to the delinquent balance, and thereafter the
Village may file a statement of lien claim with the County Recorder of Deeds.
This sworn statement of lien claim shall include: 1) a legal description of the
premises to which water service was provided sufficient to identify the
property, 2) the amount of the unpaid water user service charges and
delinquency charges and other charges as provided herein, 3) the date when the
amount due became delinquent, and 4) a notice that the Village claims a lien
for the stated amount as well as for all water service user charges and
delinquency charges, subsequent to the period for which the bill was rendered.

owner of the premises to which water service was provided by the Village, and
the Village has previously received notice of this, notice of delinquency and
lien shall be mailed to the owner of the premises at the address of the
premises or at the owner's address on file with the Village. The failure of the
Village to record the lien with the County Recorder of Deeds, or to mail the
notice of delinquency and lien to the owner of the premises or failure of the
owner to receive such notice, shall not affect the right of the Village to
foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned herein. The property owner
shall be responsible for a fifty eight dollar ($58.00) charge for processing
and release of any lien hereunder, in addition to actual recording charges
incurred by the Village for the lien claim and the release.
   D.   Lien For Unpaid Charges: Property subject to a lien for unpaid water
user service charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds
of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is
the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by
bill in equity in the name of the Village. The Village legal counsel is hereby
authorized to institute such proceedings or other collection proceedings in the
name of the Village in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against
any property for which the bill has remained unpaid sixty (60) days after it
has been rendered. In any litigation instituted by the Village to collect
amounts due or foreclose liens, all persons responsible for payment of
delinquent bills shall be responsible for reasonable costs and attorney fees
incurred by the Village in such litigation.
   E.   Village Treasurer: It is hereby made the duty of the Village Treasurer
to render bills for service and all other charges in connection therewith and
to endeavor to collect all monies due thereon.

corporate limits of the Village may be completed unless the Village Sewer and
Water Department has been notified of the impending transfer and has given its
statement of final fees and charges for water service and sanitary sewage
treatment service to the property to be paid at the time of closing, or has
given its written statement that there are no outstanding charges relative to
the said property. In the event that property is acquired without payment made
for water and/or sanitary sewage treatment service due at the time of
acquisition, then the person acquiring the property shall be responsible for

water, or if it is found that the backflow prevention device has been removed
or bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises, or
if a low pressure cutoff required by these regulations is not installed and
maintained in working order. The superintendent of water of the village is
hereby authorized and directed to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the
occupant thereof, the water service to any property wherein any connection in
violation of the provisions of this chapter is known to exist, and to take such
other precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger
of contamination of the public water supply distribution mains.
   B.   Water service to such property shall not be restored until such
conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the provisions
of this chapter, and the village has been reimbursed for all of the village's
costs incurred as the result of said disconnection. In addition to the
foregoing, the consumer shall be responsible for all the expenses incurred by
the village in accomplishing a reconnection and an inspection of the
reconnection work prior to acceptance thereof.
   C.   The consumer responsible for back siphoned material or contamination

SECTION:
7-7-1: Definitions
7-7-2: Tax Imposed
7-7-3: Collection Of Tax By Retailer
7-7-4: Returns To Department
7-7-5: Resellers
7-7-6: Severability
7-7-7: Effective Date
7-7-8: Repealer
7-7-1: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
   AMOUNT PAID: The amount charged to the taxpayer's service address in this
municipality regardless of where such amount is billed or paid.
   DEPARTMENT: The Illinois department of revenue.
   GROSS CHARGE: The amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or
receiving telecommunications in the village and for all services and equipment
provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money whether paid in
money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every
kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the
cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or
service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the
amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross charges" for
private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination
point within a municipality that has imposed a tax under this chapter and
charges for the portion of the interoffice channels provided within that
municipality. Charges for that portion of the interoffice channel connecting
two (2) or more channel termination points, one or more of which is located
within the jurisdictional boundary of such municipality, shall be determined by
the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the
interoffice channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary
of the municipality and the denominator of which is the total number of channel
termination points connected by the interoffice channel. Prior to January 1,
2004, any method consistent with this definition or other method that
reasonably apportions the total charges for interoffice channels among the
municipalities in which channel termination points are located shall be
accepted as a reasonable method to determine the taxable portion of an
interoffice channel provided within a municipality for that period. However,
"gross charge" shall not include any of the following:
   A.   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made
pursuant to: 1) the tax imposed by this chapter, 2) the tax imposed by the
telecommunications excise tax act, 3) the tax imposed by section 4251 of the
internal revenue code, 4) 911 surcharges, or 5) charges added to customers'
bills pursuant to the provisions of section 9-221 or 9-222 of the public
utilities act, as amended, or any similar charges added to customers' bills by
retailers who are not subject to rate regulation by the Illinois commerce
commission for the purpose of recovering any of the tax liabilities or other
amounts specified in those provisions of the public utilities act.
   B.   Charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside of such
municipality.
   C.   Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data
or information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or
information intended to change its form or content. Such equipment includes,
but is not limited to, the use of calculators, computers, data processing
equipment, tabulating equipment or accounting equipment and also includes the
usage of computers under a time sharing agreement.
   D.   Charges for customer equipment, including such equipment that is leased
or rented by the customer from any source, wherein such charges are
disaggregated and separately identified from other charges.
   E.   Charges to business enterprises certified as exempt under section 9-
222.1 of the public utilities act to the extent of such exemption and during
the period of time specified by the department of commerce and economic
opportunity.
   F.   Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided
in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under
this chapter has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that
the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or
between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service.
   G.   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a
sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made).
   H.   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin operated telecommunication
devices.
   I.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee act.
   J.   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: 1) those
charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are
taxable, 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and 3) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
   INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate
or terminate outside this state.
   INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that originate and
terminate within this state.
   PERSON: Any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership,
association, joint stock company, joint venture, corporation, limited liability

order of any court, the federal and state governments, including state
universities created by statute, or any city, town, county, or other political
subdivision of this state.
   PURCHASE AT RETAIL: The acquisition, consumption or use of
telecommunications through a sale at retail.
   RETAILER: Means and includes every person engaged in the business of making
sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its
discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.
   RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE (Or Any Like Term):
Means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state,
directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission
facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or
other representative operating within this state under the authority of the
retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or
agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or
whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.
   SALE AT RETAIL: The transmitting, supplying or furnishing of
telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection
therewith for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state
governments, and state universities created by statute and other than between a
parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
   SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees,
or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as
authorized by this chapter.
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS: In addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly
ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service,
private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,
computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service,
specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this chapter, "private line" means
a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this chapter,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupations tax act. (Ord. 2002-55, 9-10-2002; amd. Ord.
2010-10, 4-13-2010)

telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of four
and three-fourths percent (43/4%) 2  of the gross charge for such
telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual
multistate taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under
this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in
another state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted
pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of such
tax properly due and paid in such other state which was not previously allowed
as a credit against any other state or local tax in this state.
   C.   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or privilege
to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality. (Ord. 2010-10, 4-13-2010)

7-7-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILER:
   A.   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 2002-55, 9-10-2002)
7-7-4: RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT:

department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal telecommunications tax
act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any accompanying rules and
regulations created by the department to implement the act. (Ord. 2002-55, 9-
10-2002)
7-7-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon arrival of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the
grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale
number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 2002-55, 9-10-2002)
7-7-6: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter, or the application of any provision of this
chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall
not affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that can be
given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its
application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter. (Ord. 2002-
55, 9-10-2002)

This chapter shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and
approval and publication as required by law, provided, however, that: a) the
tax increase provided for herein shall take effect for all bills issued on or
after January 1, 2011, and b) any amounts due or payable to the village for any
tax periods ending prior to January 1, 2011, shall nevertheless remain payable
as if this chapter had not been amended at this time. Copies of the ordinance
codified herein shall be certified and sent to the Illinois department of
revenue prior to September 20, 2010. (Ord. 2010-10, 4-13-2010)
7-7-8: REPEALER:
If public act 92-0526, entitled the simplified municipal telecommunications tax
act, is repealed or becomes ineffective for any reason, or if this chapter is
repealed or becomes ineffective for any reason, then ordinance 97-51, passed
November 3, 1997, as it pertains to this tax, shall be deemed in full force and

7-9-4: COLLECTION OF TAX:
The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the purchaser by the
person maintaining a place of business in this state who delivers the
electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser
to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and if unpaid, is
recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the
electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to this chapter and any
such tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a debt
owed to the municipality by such person delivering the electricity; however,
the person delivering electricity shall be allowed a credit for such tax
related to deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as
uncollectible. Further, if such written off charges are thereafter collected,
the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax. For purposes of
this section, any partial payment not specifically identified by the purchaser
shall be deemed to be for the delivery of electricity. Persons delivering
electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the
gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity
shall also be authorized to add to such gross charge an amount equal to three
percent (3%) of the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity for the
expense incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing
returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the municipality upon request.
If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the
purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
municipality. Persons delivering electricity who file returns pursuant to this
chapter shall, at the time of filing such return, pay the municipality the
amount of the tax collected pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2010-12, 4-13-2010)

village treasurer for the month of June 2010. On or before the last day of each
month thereafter, each such taxpayer shall file a similar return with the
village treasurer, for the corresponding prior month.

by the village at all times during the business hours of the day. (Ord. 2010-

due under the provisions of this chapter, whether as a result of a mistake of
fact or any error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax
due or to become due under this chapter from the taxpayer who made the
erroneous payment; provided that no amounts erroneously paid more than three

is held, requesting a disposition be made and setting forth public sale
information.

possession of a motor vehicle or other vehicle cannot be identified from the

mail to the registered owner or other person known by the Police Department or
towing service to be legally entitled to the possession of the vehicle. Such
notice shall contain a complete description of the vehicle to be sold and what
steps must be taken by any legally entitled person to reclaim the vehicle.
   B.   In those instances where the certified notification specified herein

addressee having moved, or being unknown at the address obtained from the
registration records of this State, the sending of a second certified notice
will not be required.

   A.   When the identity of the registered owner or other person legally

manner authorized by this Chapter without notice to the registered owner or
other person legally entitled to the possession of the vehicle.
   B.   When an abandoned vehicle of more than seven (7) years of age is
impounded as specified by this Chapter, it will be kept in custody for a
minimum of ten (10) days for the purpose of determining ownership, the contact

stolen motor vehicle files for theft and wanted information. At the expiration

   A.   The person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on
the date the violation notice was issued;
   B.   The person having already paid the fine or late fee for the violation

If the traffic administrator provides a suspension notice to a vehicle owner
and subsequently makes a certified report to the secretary of state, the
subject vehicle owner may challenge the accuracy of the certified report in
writing. To do so, the vehicle owner must submit to the traffic administrator a
written statement under oath, together with any supporting documentation,
establishing one of the following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the
certified report:
   A.   That the person was not the owner or lessee of the subject vehicle or
vehicles receiving five (5) or more automated traffic law violations on the
date or dates such violation notices were issued; or
   B.   That the person already paid the fines or penalties for the five (5) or
more automated traffic law violations on the certified report. Such statement
and support documentation must be sent to the traffic administrator within five
(5) days after the person receives notice from the secretary of state that the
person's driver's license will be suspended at the end of a specified period of
time unless the secretary of state is presented with a notice from the village
certifying that the fines or penalties due and owing have been paid or that the
inclusion of the person's name on the certified report was in error. The
traffic administrator or his designee shall immediately review all documents
submitted pursuant to this subsection and shall determine whether the certified
report was in error. If the report was in error, the traffic administrator
shall notify the secretary of state immediately that the inclusion of the
person's name on the certified report was in error. (Ord. 2009-16, 6-9-2009)

violation received a traffic citation from a police officer at the time of the
violation, the owner of the motor vehicle is subject to a fine of one hundred

the failure to respond date set in the Notice of Violation, then a late fee of
one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be added to the fine. (Ord. 2009-16, 6-9-

compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, or unauthorized discharge of pollutants. (Ord. 2014-17, 6-10-2014)
9-6-5: DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   Discharges Prohibited:
      1.   No person shall throw, drain, or otherwise discharge, cause, or
allow others under its control to throw, drain, or otherwise discharge into the
MS4 any pollutants or waters containing any pollutants, other than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm
drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
         a.   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing, landscape irrigation,
diverted stream flows, rising groundwaters, uncontaminated groundwater
infiltration, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, discharges from potable water
sources, foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, irrigation water,

         b.   Discharges or flow from firefighting and other discharges
specified in writing by the village as being necessary to protect public health
and safety.
         c.   Discharges associated with dye testing. However, this activity
requires a verbal notification to the village prior to the time of the test.
         d.   The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the United States
environmental protection agency (EPA); provided, that the discharger is in full
compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations; and provided, that written approval has been
granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.
      2.   The village may evaluate and remove any of the above exemptions if
it is determined that they are causing an adverse impact.
   B.   Illicit Connections Prohibited:
      1.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      3.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a connection
to continue.
      4.   Improper connections in violation of this chapter must be
disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved on site wastewater
management system or the sanitary sewer system, upon approval of the village.
      5.   Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps
or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system shall be
located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written
notice of violation from the village requiring that such locating be completed.
Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of
the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the drain or conveyance be
identified as a storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall
location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer
system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations
are to be documented and provided to the village. (Ord. 2014-17, 6-10-2014)
9-6-6: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
   A.   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the village prior to allowing discharges to the MS4.
   B.   The operator of a facility, including construction sites, required to
have an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial or
construction activity shall submit a copy of the notice of intent (NOI) to the
village at the same time the operator submits the original notice of intent to
the EPA as applicable. The copy of the notice of intent may be delivered to the
village either in person or by mailing to:
      Notice Of Intent To Discharge Stormwater
      Village Administrator
      66 Thillen Drive
      Fox Lake, IL 60020
   C.   A person commits an offense if the person operates a facility that is
discharging stormwater associated with industrial activity without having
submitted a copy of a notice of intent to do so to the village. (Ord. 2014-17,
6-10-2014)
9-6-7: MONITORING DISCHARGES:
   A.   The village shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the village.
   B.   Facility operators shall allow the village ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying
of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater and the performance of any additional duties as defined by
state and federal law.
   C.   The village shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary, in the opinion of the village, to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
   D.   The village has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   E.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the village and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
   F.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the village access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A
person who is the operator of a facility required to have an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the village reasonable access to the permitted facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
   G.   If the village has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and a village official is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the village may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2014-17, 6-10-2014)
9-6-8: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO REDUCE POLLUTION:
The village will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for
any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States. The owner or operator of such activity, operation, or facility shall
provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or
watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises that is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
stormwater management plan (SWMP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 2014-17, 6-10-2014)
9-6-9: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 2014-17, 6-10-2014)
9-6-10: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the village in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the village within three (3) business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least five (5)
years. Failure to provide notification of a release as provided in this section
is a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2014-17, 6-10-2014)
9-6-11: VIOLATIONS, ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Violations: It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. Any
person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter
may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be
restrained by injunction or otherwise or may be required to abate the violation
in a manner provided by law. In the event the violation constitutes an
immediate danger to public health or public safety, the village is authorized
to enter upon the subject private property without giving prior notice, to take
any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the
property. The village is authorized to recover costs of the abatement as
outlined in subsection D2 of this section.
   B.   Warning Notice: When the village finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the village may, in lieu of a notice of violation, serve upon that
person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed
to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the
matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease.
Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice
in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this
subsection shall limit the authority of the village to take any action,
including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first
issuing a warning notice.
   C.   Notice Of Violation; Appeals:
      1.   Issuance And Contents:
         a.   Whenever the village finds that a person has violated a provision
of this chapter or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the village
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person.
The notice of violation shall contain:
            (1)   The name and address of the alleged violator;
            (2)   The address, when available, or a description of the
building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has
occurred;

appealed to the village by filing a written notice of appeal within seven (7)
days of service of notice of violation; and
            (7)   A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to
restore compliance within the established time schedule, the work may be done
by a designated governmental agency or a contractor, and the expense thereof
shall be charged to the violator.
         b.   Such notice may require, without limitation:
            (1)   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
            (2)   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
            (3)   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall
cease and desist;

contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
            (5)   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation
costs; and
            (6)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
      2.   Appeal: Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the
determination of the village to the village board. The notice of appeal must be
received within seven (7) days from the date of service of the notice of
violation. Hearing on the appeal before the appropriate authority or his/her
designee shall take place within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of
the notice of appeal. The decision of the municipal authority or its designee
shall be final.
   D.   Abatement Of Violations; Costs:
      1.   Abatement Procedure: If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation or, in the
event of an appeal, within seven (7) days of the decision of the municipal
authority upholding the decision of the village, then representatives of the
village may enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take
any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the
property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner or agent in possession of
any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor
to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth herein.
      2.   Costs:
         a.   Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the violation, the
owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including
administrative costs. The property owner may file a written appeal objecting to
the amount of the assessment within thirty (30) days. The village board shall
conduct a hearing within thirty (30) days. If the amount due is not paid in a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by
the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become
a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment, and shall be recorded in the office
of the recorder of deeds.
         b.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the village by reason of such violation. The liability shall
be paid in not more than five (5) equal payments. Interest at the rate of six
percent (6%) per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on day thirty
(30) following notification of the amount of the fine or assessment.
   E.   Suspension Of MS4 Access:
      1.   Emergency Cease And Desist Orders:
         a.   When the village finds that any person has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or
that the person's past violations are likely to recur, and that the person's
violation(s) has (have) caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the village may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the violator to:
            (1)   Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
            (2)   Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
         b.   Any person notified of an emergency order under this subsection
E1 shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In
the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
emergency order, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment
to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a
facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
The village may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the village that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the
discharger under this section. A person that is responsible, in whole or in
part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the village within five
(5) days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the violator.
      2.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
village may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with the suspension order
issued in an emergency, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
      3.   Suspension Due To Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have his/her MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
village will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.
The violator may petition the village for a reconsideration and hearing by the
village board. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access
to premises terminated pursuant to this subsection without the prior approval
of the village.
   F.   Civil Penalties: In the event the alleged violator fails to take the
remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to
cure the violations described therein within one day, or such greater period as
the village shall deem appropriate, after the village has taken one or more of
the actions described in this section, the village may impose a penalty not to
exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) (depending on the severity of the
violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the
notice of violation.
   G.   Criminal Prosecution: Any person that has violated or continues to
violate this chapter shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest
extent of the law, and shall be subject to a criminal penalty of seven hundred
fifty dollars ($750.00) per violation per day. Each act of violation and each
day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.
   H.   Compensatory Action: In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and
remedies authorized by this section, the village may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup or similar remedial measures.
   I.   Violations A Public Nuisance: In addition to the enforcement processes
and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation
of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety,
and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated
or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin,
or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
   J.   Remedies Not Exclusive: The remedies listed in this section are not
exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state
or local law, and it is within the discretion of the village to seek cumulative
remedies. The village may recover all attorney fees, court costs and other
expenses associated with enforcement of this chapter, including sampling and
monitoring expenses. (Ord. 2014-17, 6-10-2014)

identifying properties, businesses, services, residences, events and other
matters of public interest. This chapter establishes the standards for the
location, quantity and characteristics of signs throughout the Village. All
newly proposed signs must meet the standards listed within this chapter.
Legally existing signs that are not in conformity with this chapter will be
considered nonconforming. Specifically, it is the intent of this chapter to:
      1.   Encourage Effective Communication: Encourage the effective use of
signs as a means of communication and identification for properties in the
Village.
      2.   Maintain And Enhance Village Character: Maintain a pleasing
appearance and enhance the attractive and unique character of the Village and
of property signage and enhance the aesthetic environment of the Village.
      3.   Attract Business: Preserve Fox Lake as a community that is
attractive to businesses and allows high-quality creative sign expression.

   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to allocate permitted signage for
properties within the Village based on the land use of the property. Depending
upon the type of sign being proposed, a permit may be required. Where required
to obtain a permit, the sign will be reviewed for compliance with sound
construction practices per appropriate building codes as well as to ensure that
life and safety requirements are met and the provisions of this chapter are
complied with. Provisions of this chapter regulating the location, type, size,
purpose, placement, sign copy area, projection, height and number of signs
shall be further subject to any applicable provisions of the Village, where
this chapter differs in any manner from the provisions of the Building Code,
planned unit development ordinance relating to a specific property, annexation
agreement or other applicable ordinance. Where the provisions of this chapter
conflict with the provisions of an annexation agreement, planned unit
development ordinance or other development agreement, the provisions of such
other document will prevail and the provisions of this chapter shall only be
supplemental to such other document. All illustrations provided are for
reference only and do not reflect limitations on design or content of the sign.

and the appropriate permit fee has been paid, the Director of Community and
Economic Development shall then issue the signed permit.
      If the work authorized under a signed permit for a permanent sign has not
been completed within six (6) months after date of issuance, said permit shall

Economic Development to the permittee.
   Upon termination or revocation of the permit, the permittee shall remove the
sign and if the permittee shall fail, neglect or refuse to do so, the Village

(Ord. 2017-54, 11-28-2017; amd. Ord. 2018-36, 8-14-2018; Ord. 2018-42, 9-11-
2018)
10-1-8: AREAS OF SPECIAL CONTROL:
It is recognized that the regulations provided in this chapter cannot
sensitively handle all of the sign situations that may be proposed. Therefore,
the President and Board of Trustees of the Village may designate any of the
following matters as areas of special control:
   A.   Architectural, Historic And Scenic Areas: An architectural, historic or
scenic area is an area whose special and unique visual characteristics and
natural beauty requires special sign provisions to ensure that all signs used
within the areas are compatible with each other. Generally, it is expected that
sign provisions in these areas will be more restrictive than those which would
otherwise be applicable under this chapter.
   B.   Downtown Area: The Downtown Area of Fox Lake requires special sign
provisions to ensure that the general walkability, waterfront vistas and
access, and business core that make up the downtown are not adversely affected
by construction of new or remodeling of existing signs. Generally, it is
expected that sign provisions in this area will be more restrictive than those
which would otherwise be applicable under this chapter. This area shall include
all of Grand Avenue, Nippersink Boulevard, Pistakee Lake Road (north and south)
and areas with a Downtown zoning designation. Backlit signage, channel letters
and LED message signs are not permitted on any building, structure or property
on Grand Avenue, Nippersink Boulevard, Pistakee Lake Road (north and south) and
areas with a Downtown zoning designation. Pole signs are not permitted on Grand
Avenue, Nippersink Boulevard, Pistakee Lake Road (north and south) and areas
with a Downtown zoning designation.
   C.   Planned Unit Developments: Planned commercial, planned office, research
and light industrial and planned residential developments are areas whose
character may indicate that signs should be permitted under provisions which
are less restrictive than those which would otherwise be applicable under this
chapter. (Ord. 2017-54, 11-28-2017)
10-1-9: RELIEF:
Time periods for any sign may be extended beyond the limits established by
these regulations in the discretion of the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Petitions for relief from the sign regulations herein shall be heard and
decided by the Planning and Zoning Commission at the public meeting at which
the petition is presented. Submission requirements shall be as determined by
the commission, and no public notice shall be required.
The commission, or the Mayor and Board of Trustees in the event of further
appeal, may grant such relief only by a vote of a majority of its members and
only if it finds that such relief:
   A.   Will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious
to other property in the vicinity; and
   B.   Will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property, increase the danger of fire, endanger public safety, or substantially
impair property values in the neighborhood.
Any applicant aggrieved by action of the Planning and Zoning Commission may
appeal such action by filing notice of appeal with the Village Clerk within
thirty (30) days after the action complained of. Said notice shall be directed
to the Mayor and Board of Trustees and shall describe in detail the application
and the action complained of. Said appeal shall be decided by the Mayor and
Board of Trustees by majority vote at the next Village Board meeting after
filing of the notice of appeal. The decision of the Mayor and Board of Trustees
shall be final. (Ord. 2017-54, 11-28-2017)

10-1-10-2: REMOVAL OF CERTAIN SIGNS:
   Any sign or other advertising structure, now or hereafter existing, which
advertises a business no longer being conducted, or a product no longer being
sold, shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent or person having the
beneficial use of the building, structure or premises upon which such sign may
be found. Removal shall be made within twenty (20) days after written
notification from the Director of Community and Economic Development and, upon

building, structure or property to which such sign is attached.
   Within not more than five (5) days after the expiration of any permit issued
hereunder, the person owning, maintaining, in charge, possession or control of
any sign located in the Village or of the premises or vehicle upon which such
sign is located, shall cause same to be removed or obliterated. This is the
joint and several obligations of the owner and permittee. At the expiration of
said five (5) day period, any such sign which has not been removed is hereby
declared to be a common nuisance and subject to treatment and abatement as
such.
(Ord. 2017-54, 11-28-2017; amd. Ord. 2025-16, 5-13-2025)
10-1-10-3: UNSAFE AND UNLAWFUL SIGNS:
   If the Director of Community and Economic Development shall find that any
sign is unsafe or insecure, or is a menace to the public, or has been
constructed or erected, or is being maintained in violation of the provisions
of this chapter or other provisions of the zoning ordinance, he shall give
written notice to the permittee thereof and to the owner of the property as
shown on the most recent tax rolls. If the permittee and/or owner fails to make
corrections or fails to remove or alter the sign within twenty (20) days after
said notice, the sign may be removed by the Director of Community and Economic
Development at the expense of the permittee and/or owner of the property upon
which it is located. However, the Director of Community and Economic
Development may cause any sign which is in immediate peril to persons or
property or which was erected in flagrant disregard for this chapter, to be
removed summarily with or without prior notice, at the owner’s expense. Notice
will then be sent out within three (3) days after its removal.
(Ord. 2017-54, 11-28-2017; amd. Ord. 2025-16, 5-13-2025)

identify/mark all firearms manufactured, maintain permanent records of

and described in this zoning ordinance.
      2.   District Boundaries: When uncertainty exists with respect to the
boundaries of the various districts shown on the zoning map, the following
rules shall apply:

is indicated as a strip adjacent to and paralleling a street or highway, the
depth of such strips shall be in accordance with the dimensions shown on the
maps measured at right angles from the centerline of the streets or highways.
The length of frontage shall be in accordance with dimensions shown on the maps
from sections, quarter sections, or division lines, or centerlines of streets,
highways or railroad rights of way unless otherwise indicated.

Any buildings or structures containing a nonconforming use, or any
nonconforming building or structure, shall be subject to the following
regulations:
   A.   Continuance Of Legal Nonconforming Structures And Uses:
      1.   Any lawfully established building, structure or use that does not
conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located shall be
deemed to be legal nonconforming and may be continued, except as otherwise
provided herein.
      2.   Any building or structure for which a permit has been lawfully
granted which does not conform to the regulation for the district in which it
is located may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided
construction is started within ninety (90) days and diligently prosecuted to
completion. Such building or structure shall thereafter be deemed a legal
nonconforming building, structure or use and may be continued, except as
otherwise provided herein.
   B.   Discontinuance Of Legal Nonconforming Structures And Uses:
      1.   Damage Or Destruction: Except as hereinafter provided in subsection
B4 of this section, if any legal nonconforming building, structure or use is
destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
replacement cost of that portion of the principal and accessory buildings and
structures which are above the average ground elevation, such building or
structure shall not be rebuilt or reoccupied for any use except in accordance
with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Damage to an
extent of less than fifty percent (50%) shall be repaired in a manner as nearly
conforming as possible.
Restoration or repair of the building or other structure must be started within
a period of six (6) months from the date of damage or destruction and
diligently pursued to completion or the right to rebuild is lost.
      2.   Change Or Replacement To A Conforming Use: Whenever any part of a
building, structure or land occupied by a legal nonconforming use is changed to
or replaced by a conforming use, such premises shall not thereafter be used or
occupied by a nonconforming use, even though the building may have been
originally designed and constructed for the prior nonconforming use.
      3.   Discontinuance Of Use For More Than Twelve Months: Except as
hereinafter provided in subsection B4 of this section, whenever a legal
nonconforming use of any part of a building or structure, or part thereof, has
been discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, or whenever
there is evidence of a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a
nonconforming use, such use shall not be reestablished. The use of the premises
thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations of the district.
Exception: Where no enclosed building or structure is involved, discontinuance
of a legal nonconforming use for a period of six (6) months shall constitute
abandonment and shall not thereafter be used in a nonconforming manner. (Ord.
89-54, 6-26-1989)
      4.   Preservation And Continuation Of Legal Nonconforming Lots And
Single-Family Residences On Legal Nonconforming Lots: In the event a lot in a
recorded subdivision is rendered a legal nonconforming lot by virtue of the
passage of this Comprehensive Zoning Code of 1997 and 1989 and said lot would
otherwise have been legally eligible for use as the site for the construction
of a single-family residence prior to the passage of this Code, said lot shall
continue to be eligible for the construction of a single-family residence,
provided the owner's construction conforms as much as possible to this Code's
requirements.
The destruction of a single-family residence on a lot in a recorded subdivision
by any means to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the replacement
cost after said single-family residence was rendered a legal nonconforming
building by virtue of the passing of the Comprehensive Zoning Code of 1997 and
1989 may be rebuilt or repaired provided the construction conforms as much as
possible to this Code's requirements. (Ord. 97-22, 6-16-1997)

residential legal nonconforming use is altered to improve livability, no
structural alterations shall be made which would increase the number of
dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
         d.   When the bulk of a building in a Residential District containing
a residential legal nonconforming use is increased to improve livability and a
variation has been granted for such increased bulk.
      3.   Addition Or Enlargements: A legal nonconforming building or
structure, or a building or structure containing a legal nonconforming use, may
be enlarged or extended only if the use thereafter conforms to all the legal
regulations of the district in which it is located, or a variation has been
granted for such use.
A legal nonconforming building or structure which is nonconforming with respect
to yards, floor area ratio, or any other element of bulk shall not be altered

nonconformity with respect to the regulations for the district in which it is
located, unless a variation has been granted for such alteration or expansion.

commission shall make recommendation for requirements as part of its
recommendation to the Village Board.
         c.   If an applicant is aggrieved by requirements imposed by the
Community Development Department, he or she may appeal the decision to the
Village Board by filing notice of such appeal with the Village Clerk within
sixty (60) days of the action complained of.
         d.   The requirements of the guidelines shall not apply to existing

spaces shall be provided on the same basis as required for the most similar
listed use, or determined by the Zoning Board.
      1.   Computation Of Parking Spaces: When determination of the number of
off street parking spaces required herein results in a requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction of one-half (1/2) or less may be disregarded.
Any fraction in excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one parking space.
Computations shall be based on gross enclosed floor area(s) of the building(s).
   H.   Off Street Parking In R-1 And R-2 Residential Districts:

lot. Said spaces are subject to the off site parking regulations in section
9-1-5-5 of this ordinance.
Off street parking spaces shall be located behind the setback lines for the
zoning in which the residence is located. Setback areas shall be green areas.

yard is not adequate to permit access to an off street parking area located in
back of the building setback line, such parking area may be constructed in
front of the building setback line, if approved by the staff review committee.
For existing single-family residences located on a corner lot where the side
yard or back yard is not adequate to permit access to an off street parking
area located in back of the building setback line, such parking area may be
constructed in front of the building setback line at a place farthest from the
intersection of the streets, if approved by the staff review committee. (Ord.

9-1-5-7: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
   A.   General Standards: All districts are governed by the following
performance standards:
      1.   Measurement Methods:
         a.   For Smoke: For the purpose of grading the density of emission of
smoke, the Ringelmann chart, published and used by the United States bureau of
mines, shall be used. For determining smoke units, the Ringelmann density
reading shall be made every minute during the period of observation. Each
reading shall be multiplied by the time in minutes it is observed, and the
products added together to determine the total number of smoke units observed
during the total period of observation.
         b.   For Particular Matter: To determine the total net rate of
emission of particular matter within the boundaries of any lot: Find the
maximum emission in pounds per hour from each source of emission and divide by
the number of acres of lot area, thereby obtaining the hourly rate of emission
in pounds per acre. Add together the individual rates of emission found above
to determine the total rate of emission from all sources within the boundaries
of the lot.
         c.   For Noise: Sound levels shall be measured with a sound level
meter and associated octave band filter manufactured according to standards
prescribed by the American Standards Association. Measurements shall be made
using the flat network of the sound meter.
         d.   For Vibration: For the purpose of measuring vibrations, a three
(3) component measuring system shall be used. A three (3) component measuring
system denotes instrumentation which can measure earthborn vibrations in three
(3) directions each of which occurs at right angles to the other two.
      2.   Radiation Hazards: All applicable regulations of the atomic energy
commission and any instrumentality of the state of Illinois shall be complied
with.
      3.   Particulate Matter Standards: The total emission of particulate
matter shall not exceed the rate established below:
 
Height Of Emission Pounds Per
                   Hour Per Acre
   0 - 99 feet  6.00
   100 - 199 fee6.50
   200 - 299 fee7.50
   Over 299 feet10.00
 
      4.   Odors: No continuous, frequent or repetitive, or readily detectable
emission of odors or odor causing substance which would be offensive beyond any
property line of any industrial use will be permitted. The rules and
regulations of the Illinois air pollution control board shall be complied with.
      5.   Toxic Or Noxious Matter: No use on any property shall discharge
across the boundaries of said property toxic or noxious matter in such
concentrations as to be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
comfort or welfare, or cause injury or damage to other property or business.
      6.   Glare Or Heat: Any operation producing intense glare or heat shall
be performed within a completely enclosed building and effectively screened in
such a manner as not to create a public nuisance or hazard along property
boundaries.
      7.   Noise: Impulsive type noises shall be subject to the performance
standards hereinafter prescribed; provided, that such noises shall be capable
of being accurately measured with equipment. Noises capable of being so
measured for the purpose of this section, shall be those noises which cause
rapid fluctuations of the needle of the sound level meter with a variation of
no more than plus or minus two (±2) decibels. Noises incapable of being so
measured, such as those of an irregular or intermittent nature, shall be
controlled so as not to become a nuisance to adjacent uses.
At no point on the boundary of a residential district or a business district or
at one hundred twenty five feet (125') from the nearest property line of a
plant or operation, whichever distance is greater, shall the sound pressure
level of an individual operation or plant (other than the operation of motor
vehicles and other transportation facilities) exceed the decibel levels at the
designated octave bands shown hereafter for the districts indicated.

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines
for the siting of towers and antennas. The goal of this section is to: 1)
encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and to minimize the
total number of towers throughout the Village; 2) encourage the joint use of
new and existing tower sites; 3) encourage users of towers and antennas to
locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
Village is minimal; 4) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them
in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas;
and 5) enhance the ability of providers of personal wireless services to
provide such services throughout the Village quickly, effectively and
efficiently. Accordingly, the Corporate Authorities find that the promulgation
of this section is warranted and necessary.
All towers and antennas existing on the date of the passage of ordinance 98-14
shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist. Routine
maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers and antennas. New
construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers shall comply
with the provisions as set forth in this section. (Ord. 98-14, 2-2-1998)

section 7-1E-2 of the Village Code) except that requests for height exceptions
or variances for small wireless facilities shall be subject to the special use
procedure and conditions set forth in subsections B2 and B3 of this section.
(Ord. 2018-34, 7-24-2018)
   B.   General Requirements:
      1.   Location: Wireless telecommunication facilities, and wireless
service towers are permitted in the event a special use is granted in the M-
1 and M-2 Zoning Districts. In addition, wireless telecommunication facilities,
and wireless service towers are permitted on land and structures owned by the
Village if a special use is granted for this purpose.
      2.   Procedure: The procedure for applying for a special use pursuant to
this section is the same procedure established and described in section
9-1-6-10 of this ordinance.
      3.   Special Use Conditions: In accordance with section
9-1-6-10 of this ordinance, the Zoning Board shall require, but not be limited
to, satisfaction of the following conditions before recommending the grant of a
special use pursuant to this section:
         a.   The personal wireless service provider proposing to construct an
antenna support structure, tower, or mount an antenna on an existing structure,
is required to demonstrate, using technological evidence, that the antenna must
be placed in the approximate location which is proposed in order to satisfy its
function in the provider's grid system.
         b.   The provider must demonstrate by technological evidence that the
height requested is the minimum height with a necessary allowance for the
potential collocation by other telecommunications providers as hereinafter
described, necessary to fulfill the cell site's function within the grid
system.
         c.   The provider must demonstrate that the wireless service
facilities will not have an adverse effect on adjacent residential property
values.
         d.   The provider must demonstrate that the wireless service
facilities will not have an adverse visual impact and will not adversely affect
the surrounding neighborhood.
         e.   The applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located
in the M-1 and M-2 Zoning Districts shall demonstrate that a diligent effort
has been made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a
governmental structure or other governmental property and that due to valid
consideration including physical constraints, and economic or technological
feasibility, no other appropriate location is available.
         f.   The provider is required to demonstrate that it contacted the
owners of tall structures within a one mile radius of the site proposed, asked
for permission to install the antenna on those structures, and was denied for
reasons other than economic ones.
         g.   The information submitted by the applicant shall include a map of
the area to be served by the tower, its relationship to other antenna sites in
the applicant's network, and an evaluation of the suitability of existing
buildings taller than forty five feet (45'), communication towers and water
towers within one mile of the proposed tower.
   C.   Minimum Requirements When Placement Of Wireless Services Facilities Is
On Village-Owned Structures Or Property:
      1.   The applicant shall negotiate and obtain a lease or other agreement
with the Village regarding such placement and shall comply with the terms
therein;
      2.   The antenna or tower will not interfere with the purpose for which
the Village-owned property is intended;
      3.   The antenna or tower will have minimal visual or economic impact on
surrounding property;
      4.   The applicant is willing and is able to obtain adequate liability
insurance and commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation
for the use of public land or structures and other necessary provisions and
safeguards. The compensation for the lease shall be established by the
corporate authorities after considering comparable rates in other communities,
potential expenses, and other appropriate factors;
      5.   The applicant will submit an irrevocable letter of credit acceptable
to the Village to cover the cost of the antenna or tower's removal upon
termination of the lease;
      6.   The applicant must reimburse the Village for any costs which the
Village incurs by reason of the lease and the presence of the applicant's
antenna or tower; and
      7.   The applicant must obtain other land use approvals if required.
   D.   Special Prohibition: In no case shall antennas be allowed in parks or
areas designated as conservation areas.
   E.   Reservation Of Right: Notwithstanding the above, the Board of Trustees
reserves the right to deny the use of any or all Village-owned property by
anyone or all applicants.
   F.   Co-Location On Towers: To minimize adverse visual impacts associated
with the proliferation of towers, co-location of antennas by more than one
provider on existing or new towers shall be required rather than the
construction of new single-use towers as follows:
      1.   Providers may, and are encouraged to, co-locate antennas onto
towers. Provided such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with
the policy, site criteria, landscape/screening and all other provisions
contained in this Section, then such co-locations are permitted by right and
new or additional special use review approval is not required, provided that
any other permit, license, lease, or franchise requirements must also be
satisfied;
      2.   Unless the corporate authorities determine that co-location is not
feasible, the site plan shall delineate an area near the base of the tower to
be used for the placement of additional equipment or building for other users.
The site plan for towers in excess of one hundred feet (100') must propose
space for two (2) or more other users while the site plan for towers under one
hundred feet (100') must propose space for one other user. To provide further
incentive for co-location as a primary option, an existing tower may be
modified or reconstructed to accommodate the co-location of an additional
antenna, provided that an application is filed and approved by the Village;
      3.   Upon the approval of the Village, an existing tower may be modified
or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed the height limitation for towers
and antenna as contained in the Village Zoning Regulations, to accommodate the
co-location of additional antennas. The height change may occur only once per
tower, and the tower as modified must comply with the other provisions of the
Zoning Regulations.
   G.   Design Criteria:
      1.   Towers: In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures
needed in the Village in the future, any new proposed support structure shall
be designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user, unless the
applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical
or physical reasons. The Village may deny the application to construct a new
tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on
an existing structure.
         a.   Tower Design: Every new tower shall be a monopole rather than a
lattice type tower, unless otherwise authorized by the corporate authorities
for good cause shown;
         b.   Setback: Tower setbacks shall be measured from the base of the
tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. The tower
shall comply with the minimum setback requirements of the area in which they
are located in all zoning districts in addition to the specific requirements
for towers and antennas contained in this Zoning Ordinance. In no event shall
the tower be less than two hundred twenty five feet (225') from the closest
residential structure.
         c.   Lights, Signals And Signs: No signals, lights or signs shall be
permitted on towers unless required or recommended by the FCC or the FAA.
         d.   Tower Safety: The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed
tower is safe and the surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by
support structure failure, falling ice or other debris or interference. All
towers shall be fitted with an anti-climbing device, as approved by the
manufacturer.
         e.   Standards: To ensure the safe operation of towers, the owner of a
tower shall maintain the tower in compliance with all FCC and FAA standards and
applicable standards of any other governmental agency and the applicable
standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association (EIA), as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
Village concludes that a tower fails to comply with such standards or
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to
the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such
tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such
tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the Village may remove such
tower at the owner's expense, or the Village shall have the right to bring the
tower into compliance and the costs of which shall constitute a lien on the
property and the Village shall have the right to record and enforce said lien.
         f.   Structural Design: The tower shall be constructed to the EIA
standards, which may be amended from time to time, and all applicable
construction/building codes. Further, any improvements and/or additions to
existing towers shall require submission of site plans sealed and verified by a
professional engineer which demonstrate compliance with the EIA standards and
all other good industry practices in effect at the time of said improvement or
addition. Said plans shall be submitted and reviewed at the time existing
building permits are requested.
      2.   Antenna Criteria: To the extent feasible, antennas on or above a
structure shall be subject to the following:
         a.   The antenna must be architecturally compatible with the building
structure or wall on which it is mounted and designed and located so as to
minimize any adverse aesthetic impact;
         b.   The applicant shall demonstrate the antenna is the minimum height
required to function satisfactorily;
         c.   The antenna shall be mounted on a wall of an existing building in
a configuration as flush to the wall as technically possible and shall not
project above the wall on which it is mounted unless for technical reasons the
antenna needs to project above the wall. In no event shall an antenna project
more than fifteen feet (15') above the height of the building;
         d.   The antenna shall be constructed, painted or fully screened to
match as closely as possible the color and texture of the building and wall on
which it is mounted;
         e.   The antenna shall be attached to an existing conforming
mechanical equipment enclosure which projects above the roof of the building,
but may not project any higher than fifteen feet (15') above the enclosure;
         f.   If an accessory equipment shelter is to be erected or is present,
the equipment shelter must blend to the extent practicable with the surrounding
buildings in architectural character and color. The structure must be
architecturally and visually (color, size and bulk) compatible with surrounding
existing buildings, structures and/or uses or those likely to exist on the
terms of the underlying zoning;
         g.   If a proposed antenna is to be located on a building or a lot
subject to a special use permit, written Village approval is required prior to
the issuance of a building permit for the antenna;
         h.   No antenna shall be permitted on property designated as an
individual landmark or as a part of an historic district or site, unless such
antenna has been approved in accordance with this Section and written
permission is obtained from the Village;
         i.   On buildings forty five feet (45') or more in height, the antenna
may be mounted on the roof if:
            (1) The Village finds that it is not technically possible or
aesthetically desirable to mount the antenna on a wall;
            (2) No portion of the antenna or base station causes the height of
the building to exceed the limitations set forth herein;
            (3) Roof-mounted antennas are completely screened from view by
materials that are consistent and compatible with design, color, and materials
of the building;
            (4) No portion of the antenna may extend more than fifteen feet
(15') above the height of the existing building;
            (5) No antenna shall cause localized interference with the
reception or transmission of any other communication signals including, but not
limited to, public safety signals, and television and radio broadcast signals.
      3.   Facilities: Facilities should be architecturally compatible with the
surrounding buildings and land uses in the zoning district or otherwise
integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site to the extent practicable.
      4.   Color: Towers and antennas shall have a color generally matching the
building, surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility, unless a
different color is required by the FCC or FAA. Muted colors, earth tones and
subdued colors shall be used wherever possible. The paint on the tower shall be
properly maintained.
      5.   Equipment Structures: Ground level equipment and buildings and the
tower base shall be adequately screened. The standards for the equipment
buildings are as follows unless otherwise authorized by the corporate
authorities for good cause shown.
         a.   The maximum floor area is four hundred (400) square feet and the
maximum height is twelve feet (12'), and the structure shall be designed and
constructed so as to facilitate in the joining equipment structure of another
provider which would abut the original equipment structure.
         b.   Ground level buildings shall be screened from adjacent properties
by landscape plantings, fencing, or other appropriate means, specified herein
or elsewhere in the Village Code.
         c.   Equipment mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar to the
exterior building walls. Equipment for roof-mounted antennas may also be
located within the building on which the antennas are mounted, subject to good
engineering practices. Antennas and related equipment shall occupy no more than
twenty five percent (25%) of the total roof area of a building.
      6.   Federal Requirements: All towers and antennas must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FCC, the FAA, and any other agency of
the Federal Government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If
such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this Section shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within three (3) months
of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more
stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling Federal agency.
Upon failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations, the Village shall have the right to remove said
towers and antennas at the owner's expense at any time after sixty (60) days'
certified mail, return receipt requested, written notice to the owner at his or
her last known address.
      7.   Fencing: A well constructed wood fence, stucco, masonry or stone
wall or other fencing ("fencing") not less than nor more than six feet (6') in
height from finished grade shall be provided around each tower. The type of
fencing shall be subject to review and approval by the corporate authorities.
Security fencing should be colored or should be of a design which blends into
the character of the existing environment. Access to the tower shall be through
a locked gate.
      8.   Site Location: Site location and development shall preserve the
preexisting character of the site as much as possible. Existing vegetation
should be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of
the site should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less
visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. The effectiveness of visual
mitigation techniques must be evaluated by the Village, in the Village's sole
discretion, taking into consideration the site as built.
      9.   Cooperation: No personal wireless service facility owner or lessee
or officer or employee thereof shall act to exclude or attempt to exclude any
other personal wireless service provider from using the same building,
structure or location. Personal wireless service facility owners or lessees or
officers or employees thereof shall cooperate in good faith to achieve co-
location of personal wireless service facilities and equipment with other
personal wireless service providers pursuant to a commercially reasonable lease
agreement. If a dispute arises about the feasibility of accommodating another
competitor, the Village may require a third-party technical study, at the
expense of either or both parties, to resolve the dispute.
      10.   Wind: The antennas and their support structures shall be designed
to withstand a wind force of one hundred (100) miles per hour without the use
of supporting guy wires. No guy or other support wires shall be used in
connection with such antennas or their support structures except when used to
anchor the antennas or support structures to an existing building.
   H.   Inspection Requirements: Within thirty (30) days after a facility
becomes operational, and each year thereafter, the facility operator shall
conduct a safety inspection in accordance with FCC standards and within sixty
(60) days of the inspection, file a report with the Village. However, at the
option of the Village, the Village may secure the services of an independent
safety consultant to conduct a safety inspection and the owner of the facility
shall reimburse the Village for the reasonable cost of said inspection. In
addition, the facility operator shall provide the Village, on a quarterly
basis, a report stating the active or inactive status of the facilities
including the tower and antennas. Additionally, in the event there are any
increases to the wattage of the tower output, the facility operator shall
notify the Village within five (5) business days of any such wattage increase.
   I.   Landscaping/Screening:
      1.   Landscaping: Reasonable landscaping, as described herein, shall be
required to screen as much of the support structure as reasonable and feasible.
The fencing surrounding the support structure and any other ground level
features (such as a building), shall be designed to soften the appearance of
the facilities site. The Village may permit any combination of existing
vegetation, berming, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features
instead of landscaping, if this achieves the same objective of screening the
facility. If the antenna is mounted flush on an existing building, and all
other equipment is either housed inside an existing building or screened from
view, landscaping shall not be required, except as otherwise required by other
provisions of the Village Code or codes for the existing use.
      2.   Screening: The visual impacts of a tower shall be mitigated through
landscaping or other screening materials at the base of the tower and ancillary
structures. The following landscaping and buffering of towers shall be required
around the perimeter of the tower and accessory structures. Landscaping shall
be installed on the outside of fences. Further, existing vegetation shall be
preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for
or to supplement compliance with landscaping requirements.
         a.   A row of evergreen trees a minimum of ten feet (10') tall at
planting at a maximum of six feet (6') apart should be planted around the
perimeter of the fence unless adequate landscaping or screening is in place, or
as the Village determines otherwise.
         b.   A continuous hedge at least thirty six inches (36") high at
planting capable of growing to at least forty eight inches (48") in height
within eighteen (18) months shall be planted in front of the tree line
referenced in subsection I2a of this Section unless adequate landscaping or
screening is in place or as the Village determines otherwise.
         c.   Each owner, operator, lessee or licensee shall maintain all
fencing and landscaping including replacing any landscaping, if necessary. If
the Village specifically requests the owner, operator, lessee or licensee to
replace fencing or landscaping, the owner, operator, lessee; or licensee shall
properly comply with an such request.
   J.   Nonuse/Abandonment: In the event the use of any tower or facility has
been discontinued for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days, the facility
shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall
be made by the Village which shall have the right to request documentation and/
or affidavit from the tower owner or operator regarding the issue of tower
usage. Upon such abandonment, the owner or operator of the tower shall have an
additional sixty (60) days within which to:
      1.   Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another
owner or operator who makes actual use of the tower; or
      2.   Dismantle and remove the facilities including, but not limited to,
the tower, storage shed, fence, driveway and all other ancillary structures and
to restore the property including the landscaping to the extent reasonably
possible, to the conditions existing at the time of installation of the
facility. If such tower is not removed within said sixty (60) days, the Village
may remove such tower at the owner's expense. If there are two (2) or more
users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until
all users cease using the tower. Unnecessary sections of the tower shall be
removed.
At the earlier of sixty (60) days from the date of abandonment without
reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, Village approval
for the tower shall automatically expire. If an abandonment of a tower occurs
by all of the permittees, licensees or owner of the tower, the owner of the
tower shall remain primarily responsible if the tower ceases to be used for its
intended purposes by either it or other permittees or licensees for the
transmission or reception of personal wireless services. In the event that the
tower ceases to be licensed by the FCC for the transmission of radio energy,
the owner of the tower shall maintain the prescribed painting and/or
illumination of such tower until it is dismantled. The application for any

and corporate authorities related to the availability of suitable existing
towers, other structures or alternative technology. If the applicant believes
that co-location is unavailable to applicant and that no reasonable alternative
technology exists to accommodate the applicant's evidence to demonstrate that
no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna and said evidence may consist of the following:
         a.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographical area which meet the applicant's engineering requirements;

does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable micro-cell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wire
line system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed newer
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
All pending or new applications for the siting of personal wireless services
facilities shall comply with the provisions set forth in this Section.
   L.   Third Party Review: The personal wireless services providers use
various methodologies and analysis tools, including geographically based
computer software, to determine the specific technical parameters of personal
wireless services, such as expected coverage area, antenna configuration and
topographic constraints that affect signal paths. In certain instances there
may be a need for expert review by a third party of the technical data
submitted by the personal wireless services provider. The Village may require
such a technical review, to be paid for by the applicant for the personal
wireless services facilities. The selection of the third party expert may be by
mutual agreement between the applicant and the Village or at the discretion of
the Village, with a provision for the applicant and interested parties to
comment on the proposed expert and review its qualifications. The expert review
is intended to be a site specific review of technical aspects of the personal
wireless services facilities and not a subjective review of the site selection.
Such a review should address the accuracy and completeness of the technical
data, whether the analysis, techniques and methodologies are legitimate, the
validity of the conclusions and any specific technical issues outlined by the
Board of Trustees, the Building and Zoning Officer, Village staff, third party
consultants or other interested parties. Based on the results of the third
party review, the Village may require changes to the application for the
personal wireless services facilities that comply with the recommendations of
the expert.

to seek injunctive relief for any and all violations of this Section and all
other remedies provided at law or in equity. If the Village prevails in any
action at law or in equity, the Village shall also be entitled to recover its
attorney fees, costs and all other expenses incurred in conjunction therewith,
as may be summarily assessed and awarded by the court as part of its judgment.
   N.   Severability: Should any paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word of
this Section be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court or agency of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect
any of the remaining paragraphs, sentences, clauses, phrases or words of this
section, all of which will remain in full force and effect. (Ord. 98-14, 2-2-

secretary prior to the vote on the amendment by the board of trustees. (Ord.
2009-18, 8-11-2009)
9-1-6-10: SPECIAL USE PETITIONS:
   A.   Purpose: The development and execution of this ordinance is based upon
the division of the village into districts. Within these districts, the use of
land and buildings, bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation
to the land, are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there
are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be
properly classified in any particular district or districts. In such cases,
consideration is required of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and
of the public need for the particular use on the particular location. Such
special uses fall into two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   B.   Hearings On Petitions: The plan commission shall conduct a public
hearing on the petition for a special use at the time and place stated in the
notice. The village staff shall make a report and recommendation to the plan
commission on or before the date for the public hearing.
   C.   Standards: No special use shall be recommended by the plan commission
unless they shall find:
      1.   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare.
      2.   That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
      3.   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
      4.   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      5.   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
      6.   That the special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the village board of
trustees.
   D.   Recommendation And Adoption For Special Use:
      1.   Plan Commission: The plan commission shall make written findings of
fact and shall submit this, together with its recommendation, including
stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees, when they are deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest.
      2.   Village Board Of Trustees: The village board of trustees may grant
or deny any application for a special use after receiving the report of the
plan commission except, in case of written protest against any application for
a special use signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of
the frontage immediately adjoining or across the alley from the property
proposed for special use or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the
frontage directly opposite such property, the Village Board of Trustees shall
not grant the special use except by a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all
members of the Village Board of Trustees.
      3.   Temporary Uses: In certain instances where an exigent circumstance
exists, or where temporary use of property is of considerable benefit toward
enhancing commercial development in the Village without significant impairment
of the rights of surrounding landowners, a special use permit may be authorized
for temporary use of property in a zoning district for a purpose that is
neither permitted in that zoning district nor allowed as a special use. Such a
temporary use shall only be allowed as a special use after compliance with this
section, and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall find in addition to the
findings of subsection C of this section, that the temporary use is necessary
to avert a circumstance that would be greatly detrimental to the economic well-
being of the applicant with little detriment to the public or surrounding
landowners.
   E.   Transferability Of Special Uses: If a special use is granted to an
applicant for a certain property and the property or an interest therein is
transferred so that a new entity will engage in the use, then the special use
may be deemed to be transferred to the new entity, provided that: 1) the new
entity shall file a written application for transfer of the special use and
shall appear at a meeting of the Board to answer any questions related to the
application; and 2) the new entity shall agree in writing to be bound by any
and all conditions and restrictions related to the special use at the time the
special use is approved for transfer. If the Village Board finds that the
standards of subsection C of this section are met if the special use is
transferred, then the Village Board may adopt an ordinance approving the
transfer. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to extend the time of a
special use beyond the period for which it was originally granted, and any
business license granted to a holder of a special use or transferee shall only
be deemed to be valid until such time as the special use expires.
   F.   Abandonment Of Special Use: If the holder of a special use or its
transferee has not engaged in the use on the property for a period of twelve
(12) months any time after the special use was granted, then the special use
shall be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not thereafter be transferable
or engaged in by the holder or its transferee on the property.
   G.   Revocation Of Special Use: For all special uses for purposes other than
short-term housing rentals, if the Corporate Authorities find that the holder
of a special use has failed to comply with the conditions of a special use, or
if a public nuisance has resulted from the use as authorized by a special use,
then the Corporate Authorities may revoke the special use after mailing notice
of the findings to the holder of the special use at his last known address, or
if unknown, by posting notice of the findings on the premises. Such notice
shall provide that the holder of the special use is entitled to a hearing
before the Village Board, to be conducted within fourteen (14) days after the
date of mailing or posting. The decision of the Village Board shall be final.

9-1-6-11: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT:
   A.   Purpose: The planned unit development is a concept which encourages
improved design in the development of land by providing relief from rigid zone
requirements which are designed for conventional developments but which may
cause undue hardship or complication for desirable but unconventional
development. The planned unit development amendment procedure is intended to
provide a single uniform procedure for total review of a proposed development
project so that all the details of use and site design may be reviewed
simultaneously. The procedure combines the design review procedure of zoning
amendment. It is the intent of this procedure to encourage the variety and
flexibility that is now possible in development for all uses and to encourage
development projects resulting in the greatest possible efficiency and amenity.
   B.   Permitted Uses: In a planned unit development, any uses permitted in
any zoning district of this ordinance may be permitted subject to the criteria
established in this section and section
9-1-1-2, "Intent And Purpose", of this ordinance.
   C.   Qualifying Requirements For A Planned Unit Development:
      1.   Water And Sewage Service: Community sanitary sewage and potable
water facilities connected to publicly owned systems shall be required in any
planned unit development involving multiple-family dwellings, dwelling units on
lots of less than forty thousand (40,000) square feet or business use.
      2.   Property Ownership: Ninety percent (90%) of all land in a planned
unit development shall be under single ownership or control to be eligible for
consideration at the preliminary development plan stage and the applicant shall
provide such proof.
      3.   Bonding: The owners of the property must be bondable for the
completion of streets, sewer and water.
   D.   Standards: For any approved planned unit development, the regulations
and standards established in this section may be substituted for the zone
regulations and general regulations set forth elsewhere in this ordinance.
Where this section conflicts with any other section of this ordinance, this
section shall be deemed to control.
      1.   Streets: Streets in a planned unit development may be dedicated to
public use or may be retained under private ownership. They shall be
constructed in accordance with standards required by the Village of Fox Lake
subdivision regulations.
      2.   Density: The maximum permitted gross density for a residential
planned unit development shall be the requirements established below. The
number of dwelling units or the number of bedrooms may be used, provided that
the maximum allowable number of either one is not exceeded.
      3.   Site Design General: The planned unit development shall be more
beneficial to residents or occupants of such developments and neighboring
properties than a conventional development because of comprehensive design and
a thorough application of professional standards of excellence. It should be
prepared by professional persons; architects, city planners, engineers,
landscape architects and surveyors. The benefits and improved design of the
resulting development must justify the intended deviation from the normal
requirements of this ordinance. In designing a planned unit development,
particular consideration shall be given to:
         a.   The provision of open spaces for recreation and other outdoor
benefits and uses. The open space and proposed use of such space must be
appropriate and proportionate to the scale and character of the planned unit
development indicated by its size, density, topography and number and types of
units.
         b.   The conservation of significant natural resources such as
floodplains, wetlands, forests and scenic areas and vistas.
         c.   Surface drainage and floodwater retention.
         d.   Maximum separation of vehicular traffic from pedestrianways and
play areas.
         e.   Adequate parking. The number of parking spaces shall not be less
than required for similar individual uses by this zoning ordinance.
         f.   A unified design based on harmonious architectural character,
compatible materials, and an orderly arrangement of structures and open spaces.
         g.   The provision of appropriate sites for schools and/or equal cash
value, playgrounds, parks, parkways, streets, highways, public buildings and
similar public facilities must be proportionate to the scale and character of
the planned unit development as indicated by its size, density, topography and
number and types of dwelling units.
         h.   The provision for places of workshop and other community
services, convenient shopping and service areas when provision for such service
is appropriate to the size and character of the planned unit development.
         i.   The relationship of the development to surrounding uses and
property.
         j.   Setback on the perimeter of the planned unit development great
enough to protect the privacy and amenity of adjoining uses both existing and
anticipated. In no case shall the setbacks on the perimeter be less than those
required in the zone adjacent.
         k.   The provision of safeguard facilities for the safety of the
occupants from fire and tornado.
      4.   Site Planning, External Relationships: Site planning the planned
unit development shall provide protection of the development from potentially
adverse surrounding influences and protection of surrounding areas from
potentially adverse influences in the development. In designing a planned unit
development, the following shall be:
         a.   Principal vehicular access shall be from major streets, and
access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with
controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian
traffic. In no case shall streets connect in such a way as to encourage use of
minor streets for through traffic.
         b.   Any access for pedestrians and cyclists entering or leaving a
planned unit development shall be arranged to provide safe and convenient
routes.
         c.   To protect visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and
pedestrians, no impediment to visibility between heights of thirty inches (30")
and eight feet (8') shall be created or maintained within twenty five feet
(25') of the intersection of any right of way or easement lines of any street.
         d.   No intensive recreational or commercial use shall be permitted in
common space within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the boundary of any
adjacent residential district.
      5.   Site Planning, General Internal Relationships: The site plan shall
provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious groupings of structures,
uses and facilities, and for appropriate relation of space inside and outside
buildings to intended uses and structural features. In particular:
         a.   Streets, drives, parking and service areas shall provide safe and
convenient access to dwelling units, project facilities, and for service and
emergency vehicles, but streets shall not be laid out so as to encourage
outside traffic to traverse the development on minor streets.
         b.   Vehicular access to streets from off street parking and service
areas shall be designed to channel traffic from and to such areas in a manner
which promotes free traffic flow.
         c.   Walkways shall form a safe and convenient system for pedestrian
use.
         d.   Yards, courts, and other open spaces required herein in relation
to structures are intended to assure adequate privacy, desirable outlook,
access to and around buildings, and spaces between buildings.
      6.   Commercial Areas:
         a.   All proposed commercial facilities shall be planned as an
integral part of the design of the planned unit development.
         b.   Commercial facilities shall be so located and designed as to
provide direct access to a major street without creating traffic hazards or
congestion as follows:
(1) Buildings and parking areas shall have direct access to a major street.
(2) Layout of parking areas, service areas, entrances, exits, yards, courts,
and landscaping, and the control of signs, lighting, noise or other potentially
adverse influences shall be such as to protect character within the planned
unit development and in any adjoining residential district.
         c.   Convenience centers shall be subject to the following
requirements:
(1) Such facilities shall not occupy more than ten percent (10%) of the total
area of the development.
(2) Such facilities shall be located, designed and operated so as to serve
primarily the needs of occupants within the planned unit development and shall
direct pedestrian access.
(3) Such facilities shall not by reason of their location, construction, manner
or timing of operation have signs, lighting, parking arrangement or other
characteristics that have adverse effect on residential uses within or
adjoining the district, or create traffic congestion or hazard to vehicular or
pedestrian traffic. (Ord. 89-54, 6-26-1989)
   E.   Procedures:
      1.   Preapplication Conference: Before submitting a petition for a
planned unit development, the petitioner shall confer with the village staff on
an informal basis to provide information regarding the development, and obtain
information and guidance before entering binding commitments or incurring
substantial expense.
      2.   Application Procedures For Preliminary Plan: Application shall be
made in accordance with section
9-1-6-7 of this ordinance. Said petition shall be complete with all
requirements set forth in section
9-1-6-7 of this ordinance and shall include the preliminary plan as set forth

      3.   Public Hearing Requirements: The plan commission will hold a public
hearing on the planned unit development at the time and on the date stated in
the notice. Within thirty (30) days after the closing of the public hearing,
the plan commission shall recommend the approval or denial of the proposed
planned unit development to the village board of trustees. Said recommendation
shall include not only conclusions but also findings of fact related to the
specific proposal and shall set forth particularly in what respects the
proposal would or would not be in the public interest. These findings shall
include, but need not be limited to, the following:
         a.   In what respects the proposed plan is or is not consistent with
the stated purpose of the planned unit development regulations.

the reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be in the public
interest.
         c.   The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements and
standards of the planned unit development regulations.
         d.   The physical design of the proposed planned unit development and
the manner in which said design does or does not make adequate provision for
public services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, provide for
and protect designated common open space, and further the amenities of light
and air, recreation and visual enjoyment.
         e.   The compatibility of the proposed planned unit development with
adjacent properties and neighborhood.
         f.   The desirability of the proposed planned development to the
physical development and economic well being of the entire community and
compatibility with the comprehensive plan.
      4.   Village Board Approval Of Preliminary Plat: The village board of
trustees, upon receiving the report of findings and recommendation of the plan
commission, may grant or deny any proposed amendment or may refer it back to
the plan commission for further consideration. (Ord. 2009-18, 8-11-2009)

or no use established in the planned unit development within the time stated in
the final development and construction schedule, the final development plan
shall lapse upon written notice to the applicant from the village board of
trustees and shall be of no further effect. In its discretion and for good
cause, the board of trustees may extend for a reasonable time, not to exceed
one year, the period for the beginning of construction or the establishment of
a use. If a final development plan lapses under the provisions of this section,
the zoning officer shall remove the planned unit development from the official
zoning map and shall file a notice of revocation with the recorded final
development plan. The zoning regulations applicable before the development was
approved shall then be in effect.
   I.   Permits: The building commissioner may issue permits for site or
building construction for that part of the development plan that has been
approved in the area covered by the approved final development plan for work in
conformity with the approved final development plan and with all other
applicable ordinances and regulations. (Ord. 89-54, 6-26-1989)
   J.   Enforcement Of Development Schedule: The building commissioner shall
periodically review all of the permits issued for the planned unit development,
examine all the construction that has taken place on the planned unit
development site, and compare actual development with the approved development
schedule. If the building commissioner shall find that the owners of the

development schedule, or that the rate of construction of dwelling units is
greater than the rate at which common open spaces and public recreational
facilities have been constructed and provided, he shall forward this
information to the village board along with his recommendation on action to be
taken.
Thereafter, the board of trustees shall either: 1) revoke the special use
permit for the planned unit development with the land reverting to its former
classification; or 2) notify the developer's bonding company or bank that the
village is declaring the developer in default and requesting proceeds of the
developer's bond or letter of credit; or 3) for good cause shown by the
developer, extend the time for a reasonable period for the developer to bring
the schedule into compliance. (Ord. 2004-22, 4-20-2004)
   K.   Amending Final Plan:
      1.   Minor Changes: Minor changes in the location, siting and height of
buildings and structures may be reviewed and authorized by the building
commissioner, if required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at

9-1-6-12: SPECIAL USE FOR THE M-2 RECLAMATION OVERLAY DISTRICT (ROD):
   A.   Intent And Purpose: The intent and purpose of the M-2 reclamation
overlay district (ROD) is:
      1.   To provide for the long range mixed use development of a parcel upon
which earth extraction material or mineral processing has been approved.
      2.   To identify and take advantage of the unique features of the site
that provides superior development and infrastructure taking into consideration
the parcel's condition as a result of earth extraction.
      3.   To be granted relief from the fixed regulations of conventional
zones and from certain aspects of the subdivision and other engineering and
regulatory ordinances and village plans. The ROD regulations supersede and
govern the development of properties and, in the instance of a conflict of
regulations or in the instance when other village regulations exceed the
standards of the ROD, the requirements of this section shall supersede all
other requirements.
      4.   To encourage an innovative site plan.
      5.   To encourage the enhancement and development of the postextraction
condition of the parcel.
      6.   To obtain usable open space and recreational space.
      7.   To increase the quality of the site design.
      8.   To provide a compatible relationship between ROD land uses and
adjoining land uses.
      9.   To provide sensitive handling of on site and off site traffic flow
for efficiency of circulation and safety.
      10.   To allow this ROD district to be approved only as a special use if
the application is consistent with the provisions of this section.
   B.   ROD Eligibility Requirements:
      1.   The parcel must have a unified design. The tract of land submitted
for ROD development must be developed as a single design entity even though it
may be developed in phases, or contain a wide variety of uses and activities
otherwise not necessarily compatible with one another.
      2.   All land in the parcel submitted as the ROD application must be
initially under the control of the applicant.
      3.   The entire parcel shall be no less than eight hundred (800) acres
and the current underlying zoning for said parcel must be M-2 general
manufacturing district with the right for earth extraction or material or
mineral processing.
      4.   After a proposed development has received ROD tentative plat
approval, additional property of less than eight hundred (800) acres may be
added by an applicant who has received ROD tentative plat approval as long as
the additional property is subject to the process as contained within this
section, and the criteria for ROD tentative plan approval are met for the
additional property. Such land need not be contiguous to the property, but must
enhance and further the purposes of the approved ROD tentative plan as applied
to the additional property.
   C.   Two Step Review: There is a two (2) step ROD application review
procedure as hereinafter set forth. (Ord. 2006-38, 11-14-2006)

      1.   The petitioner shall submit twenty five (25) copies of the tentative
plan (including all documents listed in subsection D6 of this section and the
deposit required by section 9-4-5 of the village code) with the zoning
secretary who shall forward them to the village clerk and plan commission.
      2.   A hearing date shall be held before the plan commission after notice
and publication shall be made in accordance with this ordinance. After the
public hearing has been closed, the plan commission shall make its
recommendation regarding the proposed development no later than the date of its
second regularly scheduled meeting after the close of the hearing, but not
later than thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing.
      3.   The village board of trustees, upon receiving the report of findings
and recommendation of the plan commission, may grant or deny any proposed
petition in accordance with applicable Illinois statutes, or may refer it back
to the plan commission for further consideration one time.
      4.   The village board of trustees, after receiving the findings and
recommendation of the plan commission, if any, may grant or deny any proposed
petition in accordance with applicable Illinois statutes. (Ord. 2009-18, 8-11-
2009)
      5.   The tentative plan is a general indication of the proposed land uses
and the general or schematic locations of detention areas, open spaces, and
parks. At this stage of planning, detailed data pertaining to precise building
locations, parks, and detention areas will not be available and will be further
refined as the plans progress to the final plan stage. The more detailed data
and site plans shall be submitted to the village for review and approval at the
final plan stage of development. It is understood that the engineering plans
for the development of the property shall not be completed at this early stage
of planning. The tentative plan will undergo further refinement and when the
final plan is prepared it will be submitted for final site plan approval and
engineering approval by the village engineer. The final plan may be submitted
for approval either in phases or as a whole. Tentative and final plans shall
permit a lesser residential density in area approved for a higher residential
density.
      6.   The tentative plan submittals shall contain the following:

the development shall be submitted to the plan commission and shall be reviewed
at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The plan commission shall make its
recommendations regarding the final plan no later than its next meeting after
the meeting at which the review has occurred. The village board shall take
final action on a final plan promptly after receipt of the recommendation of
the plan commission. If no recommendation is timely made by the plan
commission, then the final plan shall be deemed to have been approved by the
plan commission as presented. It is recognized that overlay district
developments are of a different character and may require modifications and
variations from the subdivision ordinance and other ordinances of the village.
Such modifications shall be reasonably considered and approved by the village
in its reasonable discretion as part of the final plan approval process as long
as density has not changed from the tentative plan and the final plan conforms
to requirements of the village's subdivision ordinance. However, it is
understood that the requirements of the stormwater detention ordinance will be
abided by unless the village and Lake or McHenry County (if required) grant a
waiver of same or portions of same in light of the lakes that may be created on
a parcel.
      2.   The final plan (25 copies) for any phase of the development shall

   F.   Modification To The Tentative Or Final Plan In The ROD District: "Minor
changes" are defined as changes that do not increase the residential density of
any phase of an approved tentative plan or approved final plan, and do not
require variations from the village's subdivision ordinance or this ordinance
and may be approved by the building commissioner. Major changes shall require
approval of the village board, and if a variation from this zoning ordinance is
required, then a public hearing must be held before the zoning board of
appeals. (Ord. 2009-18, 8-11-2009)
   G.   Expiration Of ROD Plan Approval: The tentative ROD plan approval shall
expire fifteen (15) years after the date of its approval unless an application

      1.   The M-2 reclamation overlay district (ROD) is an "overlay" district
in addition to the underlying zoning classifications. Any ROD zoning and
designation shall supplement other zoning districts ("underlying zoning
district"). The uses allowed in the underlying zoning district as well as the
uses allowed in the ROD are permitted uses within these areas. Once building
permits are issued for construction on property located in any underlying
zoning district, only the uses permitted in said underlying zoning district as
to the property for which the building permit was issued shall be allowed until
a final plan has been approved at a property owner's request by the board of
trustees of the village of Fox Lake and thereafter recorded for the reclamation
overlay district (ROD) use. Upon final plan recording for ROD uses, only the
uses permitted in the ROD shall be permitted as to the property described in
said final plan and the uses allowed in any other underlying zoning district
shall no longer be permitted as to the property described in said final plan
unless it is a permitted ROD use.
      2.   Upon recording of the final plan for a residential development on a
portion of the ROD district (final plan parcel) on one side of one or more
preexisting dedicated roadways, all ROD parcels depicted on the tentative ROD
plan on the same side of such preexisting dedicated roadways shall have
permitted uses which are limited to those uses allowed in the zoning categories
set forth in those adjoining parcels on the approved tentative ROD plan in
addition to earth extraction and agricultural uses permitted in the M-2 zoning
district. (Ord. 2006-38, 11-14-2006)
