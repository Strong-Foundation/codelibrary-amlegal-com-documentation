038, 28-11-214-039, and 28-11-214- 046, legally described in Exhibit B attached

C.   A building and canopy located on the Raday Lodge Property extends onto the
Subject Property and into the Grantor’s right-of-way, see attached Plat of
Survey for the Raday Lodge Property attached hereto as Exhibit C.
 
D.   Grantee seeks to demolish those portions of the building and canopy that

E.   Grantor wishes to permit the Grantee to complete the Demolition in
accordance with and under and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.
 
F.   Grantee requires a temporary easement on, over, under, across, and through
the Subject Property and the Grantor’s right-of-way in order to conduct due
diligence and, upon completion of and subject to the results of the Due
Diligence, complete, at Grantee’s sole cost and expense, the Demolition.
Grantee’s due diligence may include, but not be limited to, soil, geotechnical,
compaction studies, and environmental inspections, tests and studies (“Due
Diligence”).
 
G.   Grantor wishes to provide Grantee temporary access to the Subject Property
through a temporary easement to enable Grantee to conduct the Due Diligence and
the Demolition, in accordance with and under and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the
receipt and sufficiency of which the Parties hereby acknowledge and by which
the Parties intend to be legally bound, the Parties agree that:
 
1.   Recitals and Exhibits Incorporated.  The foregoing Recitals are
incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth in this Section 1.
All Exhibits identified in this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this
Agreement by this reference.
2.   Temporary Easement. Grantor hereby grants and conveys to Grantee a non-
exclusive and temporary easement on, over, under, across, and through the
Subject Property for the purpose of conducting the Due Diligence as specified
in Section 3 of this Agreement and completing the Demolition as provided in
Section 4 of this Agreement (collectively, the “Easement”).
 
3.   Permitted Due Diligence. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, for a period commencing on the date that Grantee starts its Due
Diligence investigations, and expiring on the date that is one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days thereafter, Grantee shall have the right, at Grantee’s sole
cost and expense, to conduct the Due Diligence as provided herein:
 
A.   Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, have the right to conduct
non-invasive physical inspections of the Subject Property, including the
environmental condition thereof, and all non-invasive inspections, tests,
studies, and investigations of the condition of the Subject Property which
Grantee may deem reasonably necessary (collectively, the “Studies”, and each
individually, a “Study”). With the prior written consent of Grantor, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, Grantee shall be entitled to take soil
samples sufficient to complete a Phase II environmental assessment on the
Easement Premises if recommended by Grantee’s Phase I environmental site
assessment. Grantee may perform invasive geotechnical soil boring testing of
the Subject Property as part of the Studies, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.
  
B.   Grantor shall allow Grantee, its agents, consultants, architects,
engineers, contractors, and any other representatives (collectively, “Grantee’s
Agents”) access to the Subject Property for the purpose of conducting the Due
Diligence. Grantee or Grantee’s Agents shall notify Grantor’s designated
representative not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to entry of the

agrees that Grantor may have a representative present at any inspection, or
other entry upon the Subject Property, by Grantee or any of Grantee’s Agents
when conducting the Studies.

of the Parties.

promptly deliver to Grantor copies of any and all Studies prepared by or for

Subject Property, at no cost or expense to Grantor.
 
   4.   Construction Activity. Upon completion of the Due Diligence, Grantee
shall, at Grantee’s sole cost and expense, be permitted but not required to
demolish those portions of the building and canopy that extend from the Raday
Lodge Property onto the Subject Property and into the Grantor’s right-of-way,
in accordance with and under and subject to the terms and conditions as
provided herein:
 
A.   If applicable, Grantee will provide Grantor with final engineering plans

B.   Grantee agrees to use due care in completing the Demolition and all
related work so as not to unreasonably disturb Grantor's use of the Subject
Property.
 
C.   Any and all debris resulting from the Demolition shall be disposed of off
of the Subject Property by Grantee in accordance with all Applicable Laws. All
earth and other material excavated and removed from the Subject Property, if

to restore the Subject Property, or be hauled away and disposed of by Grantee,
at Grantee’s sole cost and expense, and in accordance with all applicable
zoning, municipal, county, state and federal laws, ordinances and regulations,
now in effect or hereafter adopted, passed, or promulgated (collectively, the
“Applicable Laws”).
 
D.   Grantor shall not be responsible for or have control over the means,
methods, techniques, or procedures with respect to the Demolition. In no event
shall the Grantor be responsible for or have any obligation with respect to the
safety of any person performing work for, or on behalf of, the Grantee on the
Subject Property, including, without limitation, Grantee’s employees, or the
personnel of Grantee’s Agents.
 
E.   Grantee shall take such measures as are necessary to ensure that the
Subject Property is maintained in a reasonably safe condition during the
completion of the Demolition. Such measures shall include installation of
appropriate project fencing, barricades and warning signs, and strict
enforcement of all applicable safety rules and regulations. All work or
activity by Grantee or by any of Grantee’s Agents hired by Grantee to complete
the Demolition or perform any related or other work or activity within the
Subject Property shall be performed in a safe and sound manner and in
accordance with all Applicable Laws.
 
F.   Grantee shall have a period of six (6) months to complete the Demolition,
commencing on the date that Grantee starts the Demolition. Grantee agrees to
diligently pursue the Demolition on the Subject Property. “Diligently Pursue
the Demolition” means Grantee shall make steady and regular progress to
complete the Demolition, in a proper and workmanlike manner, and in accordance
with Applicable Laws. Grantee shall be deemed to be diligently pursuing the
Demolition notwithstanding delays due to the actions or inactions of parties
outside of the control of Grantee, such as private utilities.
 
G.   The Demolition period may be extended upon the mutual written agreement of
the Parties.
 
5.   Restoration. Upon completion of the Demolition, Grantee shall, at its sole
cost and expense, restore the unimproved portion of the Subject Property to the
general condition existing immediately prior to commencement of the Demolition.
In the event Grantee does not complete the Demolition, the Grantee shall, at
its sole cost and expense, restore the Subject Property to the condition
existing immediately prior to commencement of the Due Diligence. All
restoration shall be completed within ninety (90) days after the Demolition is
complete, or within ninety (90) days after completion of the Due Diligence in
the event Grantee does not complete the Demolition. If restoration cannot be
reasonably completed within ninety (90) days, the period for restoration shall
be extended for such additional time as may be reasonably necessary to complete
restoration, if: (i) Grantee has commenced the restoration work within the
thirty (30) day period and continues diligently and in good faith to complete
the restoration; or if (ii) restoration must be deferred due to seasonal
conditions. The Restoration period may be extended upon the mutual written
agreement of the Parties.

unless it is extended in writing by the Parties, shall expire, without action
by either Party, on the earlier of (i) the date that all required Restoration
Work is completed and approved by Grantor pursuant to Section 5 above, or (ii)
the date that is five (5) years after the Effective Date of this Agreement
(“Term”). Upon the expiration of the Term, this Agreement shall automatically
terminate, be void and of no further force or effect without further action by
either Party.

offense 1 , and the penalty imposed for violation of an ordinance may include,

provision with a maximum fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) are hereby
amended by striking the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00), and inserting

1-4-2: DEFAULT:
   (A)   An offender who defaults in the payment of a fine or in any
installment may be held in contempt and imprisoned for nonpayment. The court
may issue a summons for his appearance or warrant of arrest.
   (B)   Unless the offender shows that his default was not due to his
intentional refusal to pay, or not due to a failure on his part to make a good
faith effort to pay, the court may order the offender imprisoned for a term not
to exceed six (6) months, if the fine was for a felony, or thirty (30) days if
the fine was for a misdemeanor, a petty offense or a business offense. Payment
of the fine at any time will entitle the offender to be released, but
imprisonment under this section shall not satisfy the payment of the fine.
   (C)   If it appears that the default in the payment of a fine is not
intentional under subsection (B) of this section, the court may enter an order
allowing the offender additional time for payment, reducing the amount of the
fine or of each installment, or revoking the fine or the unpaid portion.
   (D)   When a fine is imposed on a corporation or unincorporated organization
or association, it is the duty of the person or persons authorized to make
disbursement of the assets, and their superiors, to pay the fine from assets of
the corporation or unincorporated organization or association. The failure of
such persons to do so shall render them subject to proceedings under
subsections (A) and (B) of this section. (Ord. 820, 10-9-1974)
   (E)   A default in the payment of a fine or penalty or any installment of a
fine or penalty may be collected by any means authorized for the collection of
monetary judgments. The municipal attorney of the village is authorized to take
any necessary legal action in order to collect any outstanding default in
payment of any fine or penalty. The village attorney and/or village president
is also authorized to retain attorneys and private collection agents for the
purpose of collecting any default in payment of any fine or penalty or
installment of that fine or penalty. Any fees or costs incurred by the
municipality with respect to the village attorney, outside attorneys or private
collection agents retained by the municipality for the purposes described in
this section shall be charged to the offender. (Ord. 1874, 9-10-2014)
1-4-3: LICENSE:
When a person is convicted of a violation of any section of this code any
license previously issued to him by the village may be revoked by the court or
by the governing body. (1963 Code)
1-4-4: APPLICATION:
The penalty provided in this chapter shall be applicable to every section of
this code the same as though it were a part of each and every separate section.
Any person convicted of a violation of any section of this code where any duty
is prescribed or obligation imposed, or where any act which is of a continuing
nature or declared unlawful, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day such duty or
obligation remains unperformed or such act continues, unless otherwise
specifically provided in this code.
In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by
different clauses or sections of this code the prosecuting officer may elect
under which to proceed; but not more than one recovery shall be had against the
same person for the same offense; provided, that the revocation of a license or
permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar any other
penalty being enforced.
Whenever the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a
breach of any section or provision of this code and there shall be no fine or
penalty specifically declared for such breach, the provisions of this chapter
shall apply and a separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day
during or on which a breach of violation occurs or continues 1 . (1963 Code)

the governing body to impose such fine or penalty on such officer or employee
is specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the duty. (1963

penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or

issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 1500, 1-

1-20-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 1500, 1-10-2001)

years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   (C)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 1500, 1-10-2001)
1-20-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 1500, 1-10-2001)
1-20-16: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 1500, 1-10-2001)
1-20-17: LIENS:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
1500, 1-10-2001)
1-20-18: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be
controlling. (Ord. 1500, 1-10-2001)
1-20-19: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, paragraph or provision of this chapter shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability of

either in response to such complaints or on the OIG's own initiative. The OIG
acknowledges that it has read and understands the applicable provisions in
state law (e.g., the uniform peace officers' disciplinary act 1 , and the
fireman's disciplinary act 2 ), the village's police and fire department
general orders and procedures and any collective bargaining agreements that
govern conducting internal investigations of village police and fire personnel,
and that failure to comply with the time periods and notice provisions
regarding these internal investigations can result in the village being barred
from prosecuting or taking employment related action against an employee for
misconduct. It is agreed by the OIG and the village that investigations of the
police or fire department employees by the OIG are subject to the applicable
internal investigation provisions of state law, the village's police and fire
department general orders and procedures and the applicable collective
bargaining agreements. In conducting its investigations of alleged misconduct,
the OIG agrees to cooperate with and assist the village attorney and/or the
police or fire chief, as warranted and appropriate, including providing
information, witness statements and other evidence, to allow the village to
pursue disciplinary action against village employees under applicable state
law, the village's personnel policies, the police and fire department general
orders and procedures and applicable collective bargaining agreements. The same

within other village departments, subject to the applicable state laws, policy
manuals, departmental general orders and procedures and applicable collective
bargaining agreements.
   (C)   To refer complaints and information regarding possible misconduct to
the president and board of trustees, the village attorney and other outside law
enforcement agencies, including, but not limited to, the United States'
attorney's office, as warranted and as appropriate. The OIG's referral of
complaints and information regarding possible misconduct to the president and
board of trustees and the village attorney, as warranted and appropriate, shall
be done in order to ensure that appropriate discipline may be imposed in
accordance with applicable state laws, general policies, departmental orders
and procedures and applicable collective bargaining agreements.
   (D)   To obtain information from, and conduct interviews under oath with
village employees, agents, contractors and persons doing or seeking to do
business with the village for the purpose of investigating potential
misconduct.
   (E)   To make recommendations for corrective action to the president and
board of trustees and the village attorney with respect to combating
misconduct.
   (F)   To provide periodic reports to the president and the board of trustees
and the village attorney as to the status of matters within the scope of OIG's
authority, to the extent such reporting would not impair the integrity of
ongoing investigations.
   (G)   To maintain an OIG hotline number and e-mail address in order to
facilitate citizen and employee reports of misconduct.
   (H)   In the event of any grievance arbitration or hearing before the

the results of an OIG investigation, the OIG will fully cooperate with the
village in the prosecution of the disciplinary action or defense of the

itemizing costs for a typical incident (from the time a fire apparatus leaves
the station until it returns to the station) and are based on the actual costs,

repairs and maintenance) and labor rates (based upon an average department's
"actual personnel expense", and not simply a firefighter's basic wage). The
actual personnel expense includes costs such as wages, retirement, benefits,
workers' compensation, insurance, etc. When a claim is submitted, it will be
itemized and based on the actual services provided in accordance with the above
rates.

for damages of the vehicles, property and/or injuries, and shall be filed with
the insurance carrier of the owner of the vehicle, owner of the property or the

responsible party will be billed directly. In all cases, however, the fire

source. The fire department will exhaust all avenues related to insurance
coverage, and will only charge individuals as a last line of defense when all
insurance companies involved deny the claim(s).

recommendation by the fire chief and approval by the village president in cases
where in their discretion it is deemed to be in the best interests of the
village or when payment of the fee would be an undue hardship or the person
receiving said services is incapable of paying said fees. Under no
circumstances, however, shall any party have the ability to require the fire
chief or village president to make such a discretionary determination.
      4.   The village board may make rules or regulations and from time to
time may amend, revoke or add rules and regulations as they may deem necessary
or expedient in respect to billing for services under this section and the
collection of rates as established herein.
      5.   Any person or entity that refuses to pay or fails to pay charges
billed will be deemed to have violated this section. The village may pursue all
remedies at law and equity to recover service charges due and owing, including
the use of the services of a collection agency. (Ord. 1862, 2-12-2014; amd.

their work and the condition in which they find the streets repaired.
Rule 7. Hydrants, taps, hoses, water closets, urinals, baths, and other
fixtures will not be permitted to be kept running when not in actual use; all
faucets connected with the service pipes must be of such pattern as may be
approved by the superintendent.
Rule 8. No private hydrant shall be located on the sidewalk or elsewhere beyond
the limits of the lot of the party to whom the permit is issued.
Rule 9. Every residence or building must have its own separate service line

Rule 11. Applications for water must state fully and truly the purposes for
which it is required, and when paying the charges for it, parties must frankly
and without concealment, answer all questions put to them, relative to the
consumption. The applicant shall, in such application, agree that in
consideration of the insertion of the corporation valve he will pay the
assessments levied or rates charged on the premises for the water pipe that is
proposed to be tapped, and that he will faithfully comply with the rules
established by this chapter, and as changed from time to time. In case of

consumed, in order to examine the pipes and fixtures and ascertain whether
there is any unnecessary waste, and, if such access be refused, the supply of
water may be cut off without further notice.
Rule 13. The right is reserved to suspend the use of lawn fountains and hose
for sprinkling lawns and gardens, whenever in the opinion of the president and

except upon the order of the superintendent nor until the applicant shall have
paid his rent for the current term; and the plumbers are strictly prohibited
from turning the water into any service pipe except upon the order and

at the service connection for either or all of the consumers and the water
rent, as registered by the meter, shall be charged to and be payable by the
owner of the premises or building.
Rule 23. The setting, taking off or repairing of meters shall be done under the
supervision of the superintendent or any other person authorized by the
president.
Rule 24. Whenever two (2) or more persons shall be supplied with one service
pipe connecting with the distribution main, the failure on the part of any one
of the parties to comply with the rules and restrictions provided for the use
of water shall authorize the superintendent to withhold the supply of water
from the main without any liability whatever, and all payments shall be
forfeited. (Ord. 148, 12-10-1935)
Rule 25. For the violation of any of these rules and regulations and such

reserves the right to stop the supply of water without any preliminary notice,
nor will it be restored until all back water rent, cost and damages shall be
paid, together with the expense of turning off the water and turning it on

3-3-33: WATER MAIN CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL:
(A)   All plumbing installed within the village shall be installed in
accordance with the Illinois plumbing code, 77 Illinois administrative code
890. If in accordance with the Illinois plumbing code or in the judgment of the
village superintendent of public works, an approved backflow prevention device
is necessary for the safety of the public water supply system, the
superintendent of public works will give notice to the water customer to
install such an approved device immediately. The water customer shall, at his
own expense, install such an approved device at a location, and in a manner,
which is in accordance with the Illinois plumbing code, Illinois environmental
protection agency requirements and all applicable local regulations, and shall
have inspections and tests made of such approved devices upon installation and
as required by the Illinois plumbing code, Illinois environmental protection
agency and local regulations.
(B)   No person shall establish or permit to be established or maintain or
permit to be maintained any connection whereby a private, auxiliary or
emergency water supply other than the regular public water supply of the
village may enter the supply or distribution system of said municipality,
unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method of
connection and use of such supply has been approved by the village and the
Illinois environmental protection agency.
(C)   It shall be the duty of the superintendent of public works to cause
inspections, surveys and investigations to be made of industrial and other
properties served by the public water supply to determine whether actual or
potential hazards to the public water supply exist. Such inspections, surveys
and investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be
repeated at least every two (2) years, or as often as the superintendent of
public works shall deem necessary. Records of such surveys shall be maintained
and available for review for a period of at least five (5) years.
(D)   Duly authorized cross connection control device inspector(s) as
designated by the superintendent of public works or Illinois environmental
protection agency shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any
property served by a connection to the public water distribution system of the
village for the purpose of verifying the presence or absence of cross
connections, and the superintendent of public works or his duly authorized and
designated agent shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any
property served by a connection to the public water distribution system of the
village for the purpose of verifying information submitted by the customer
regarding the required cross connection control inspection. On demand, the
owner(s), lessee(s) or occupant(s) of any property so served shall furnish to
the superintendent of public works any information which he may request
regarding the piping system(s) or water use on such property. The refusal to
provide such information within a reasonable time, subject to the discretion of
the superintendent of public works, may be deemed evidence of the presence of
improper connections as provided for in this chapter. (Ord. 1234, 11-13-1991)
(E)   The superintendent of public works of the village is hereby authorized
and directed, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, to discontinue
the water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of the
provisions of this chapter is known to exist, and to take such other
precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water distribution mains. Water service to such
property shall not be restored until such conditions have been eliminated or
corrected in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and until a
reconnection fee as established by the village board is paid to the village.
Immediate disconnection with verbal notice can be effected when the
superintendent of public works is assured that imminent danger of harmful
contamination of the public water supply system exists. Such action shall be
followed by written notification of the cause of disconnection. Immediate
disconnection without notice to any party can be effected to prevent actual or
anticipated contamination or pollution of the water supply; provided, that in
the reasonable opinion of the superintendent of public works or the Illinois
environmental protection agency, such action is required to prevent actual or
potential contamination or pollution of the public water supply. Neither the
village, nor the superintendent of public works or his agents or assigns shall
be liable to any customer for injury, damages, or lost revenues which may
result from termination of said customer's water supply in accordance with the
terms of this chapter, whether or not said termination was with or without
notice. The village board shall set the amount of the fee by resolution or
ordinance in a fee schedule to be maintained by the village clerk, and which
shall be made available to the public upon request. (Ord. 1651, 10- 10-2007)
(F)   The consumer responsible for back siphoned or back pressured material or
contamination through backflow, if contamination of the potable water supply
system occurs through an illegal cross connection or an improperly installed,
maintained or repaired device, or a device which has been bypassed, must bear
the cost of cleanup of the potable water supply system. (Ord. 1234, 11-13-1991;
amd. Ord. 2169, 4-23-2025)

subject to or exempt from the real property transfer stamp requirements of this
code. In order to obtain a full payment certificate, an application with an
application fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be made to the finance
director or their designee. Provided, however, if the property is exempt from
the real property transfer tax under section 4-21-4 of this code, the full
payment certificate application fee shall not be charged. If a full payment
certificate was required and such certificate was not obtained when the real
property was transferred, both the transferor and the transferee will be
jointly and severally liable for any outstanding water fees, sewer charges, and
penalties that have accrued to the water account.
(B)   Where a townhome or condominium property has a single meter and the
respective association's assessments include the individual owner's share of
the water bill, the finance director or their designee may issue a certificate
of condo or townhome owner payment or notice of account arrears as applicable,
upon application and payment of an application fee of twenty-five dollars
($25.00). (Ord. 2124, 6-14-2023; amd. Ord. 2169, 4-23-2025)

   (E)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsection (D) of this section and/or which
are in violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in 40 CFR 403, June
26, 1978, and any amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the village
and/or the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater Chicago (MWRDGC)
may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a
public nuisance, the village may:
      1.   Reject the wastes;
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge into
the public sewers;
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      4.   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions
of subsection (K) of this section.
If the village and/or MWRDGC permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the village and/or MWRDGC and subject to the
requirement of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
   (F)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the village and/or MWRDGC, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any

interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the village
and/or MWRDGC and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
   (G)   Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his expense.
   (H)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the village and/or MWRDGC, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the village. The
manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained
by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (I)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge.
The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the village, and/or MWRDGC, but no less than
once per year. The owner must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of
the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state, and
local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the village at such times and in such a
manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses, and reporting required by the village. At such times as
deemed necessary the village reserves the right to take measurements and
samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
   (J)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods For The Examination Of
Water And Wastewater" published by the American Public Health Association and
shall be determined at the control or inspection manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at said control or inspection manhole. In the event that
no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered
to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which
the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24 hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)
   (K)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the village and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with section 3-5-8 of this chapter, by the industrial concern;
provided, such payments are in accordance with federal and state guidelines for
user charge system and industrial cost recovery system. (Ord. 1191, 6-27-1990)

   (A)   Basis For Wastewater Service Charges: The wastewater service charge
for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater collection system of
the village shall consist of a basic user charge, a debt service charge, a
capital improvement charge and any applicable surcharges.
   (B)   Basic User Charge:
      1.   The basic user charge is levied on all users to recover the
operation, maintenance plus replacement (OM&R) costs and shall be based on
water usage as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for wastes having the
following normal domestic concentrations:
         (a)   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l).
         (b)   A suspended solids content of three hundred fifty milligrams per
liter (350 mg/l).
      2.   The basic user charge shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Estimate the annual wastewater volume.
         (b)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater collection system including a replacement fund for the
year, for all works categories.
         (c)   Proportion the estimated OM&R costs to wastewater collection
system categories by volume.
         (d)   Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal
domestic strength sewage.
         (e)   Compute surcharge costs per pound for BOD and SS concentrations
in excess of normal domestic strengths.
   (C)   Debt Service Charge: The debt service charge is computed by
apportioning the annual debt service as a fixed charge per billing period.
(Ord. 1191, 6-27-1990)
   (D)   Capital Improvement Charge: The capital improvement charge is levied
upon users to provide capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the
sewerage collection system. The capital improvement charge shall be a fixed
amount plus a charge per one thousand (1,000) gallons as set forth in
subsection (K) of this section. (Ord. 1728, 6-22-2010)
   (E)   Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed
the normal domestic concentrations of BOD two hundred fifty milligrams per
liter (250 mg/l) and SS three hundred fifty milligrams per liter (350 mg/l) if
the board of trustees of the village determines that a surcharge is necessary
to pay any additional cost incurred by the village due to the discharge of
sewage described in this section. A surcharge will be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the two
hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) and three hundred fifty
milligrams per liter (350 mg/l) concentrations for BOD and SS respectively.
The concentration of sewage used for computing surcharges shall be established
by sewage sampling. Such sewage sampling shall be performed as often as may be
deemed necessary by the village and shall be binding as a basis for surcharges.
   (F)   Annual Review: The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be
reviewed, not less often than annually, by certified public accountants for the
village in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be
revised periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs or OM&R costs.
   (G)   Notification Of Rate: The users of the wastewater services will be
notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that
portion of the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater operation,
maintenance and replacement.
   (H)   Measurement Of Flow: The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges and surcharges shall be metered water consumption read to the lowest
even increments of one hundred (100) gallons.
      1.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by
the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from
these other sources.
      2.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
      3.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the village. (Ord. 1191, 6-27-1990)
   (I)   Basic User Charge: The village board shall establish a basic user
charge based upon one thousand (1,000) gallons of metered water use and a fixed
charge to cover operating, maintenance plus replacement costs to be applied to
all users. These rates shall be set by the village board from time to time as
deemed necessary by ordinance or resolution. (Ord. 1866, 5-14-2014)
   (J)   Debt Service Charge: There shall be and there is hereby established a
debt service charge to be issued on a monthly basis to each user of the village
sewerage collection system. The debt service charge shall be set by the village
board from time to time by ordinance or resolution.
   (K)   Capital Improvement Charge: There shall be and there is hereby
established a capital improvement charge as stated in subsection (D) of this
section to be issued on a monthly basis to each user of the village sewage
collection system. The capital improvement charge shall be set by the village
board from time to time by ordinance or resolution.
   (L)   Rates: A minimum charge per month shall be applied to all users whose
water consumption does not exceed two thousand (2,000) gallons per month. This
minimum charge shall consist of a charge for OM&R costs (including a fixed OM&R
cost), a debt service charge and a capital improvement charge. Such minimum
charge, consisting of OM&R costs, as well as the debt service charge and
capital improvement charge shall be set by the village board from time to time
by ordinance or resolution.
Usage in excess of two thousand (2,000) gallons per month will be charged at a
rate as set by the village board from time to time by ordinance or resolution.
Bills may be issued every month or every two (2) months or every three (3)
months as determined by the village board. (Ord. 1728, 6-22-2010)
   (M)   Metered Services: At this time all water services are metered and all
new water services are required to be metered.
   (N)   Surcharge Rates: The rates of surcharges for BOD and SS shall be as
follows:
      Per pound of BOD: None at this time.
      Per pound of SS: None at this time.
   (O)   Computation Of Wastewater Service Charge: The wastewater service
charge shall be computed by the following formula:
         CW = CC + CD + CM + (Vu-X)CU + CS
Where:  
CW =   Amount of wastewater service charge ($) per billing period
CC =   Capital improvement charge
CD =   Debt service charge
CM =   Minimum charge for operation, maintenance and replacement
Vu =   Wastewater volume for the billing period

CS =   Surcharges, if applicable
 
   (Ord. 1191, 6-27-1990)
3-5-9: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   (A)   Bills: Said rates or charges for service may be payable monthly, every
two (2) months or quarterly depending on the determination of the village
board. The village board may authorize a different billing cycle for
residential use other than for apartments and commercial. The owner of the
premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service shall be jointly and
severally liable to pay for the service to such premises and the service is
furnished to the premises by the village only upon the condition that the owner
of the premises, occupant and user of the services are jointly and severally
liable therefor to the village.
Bills for sewer service shall be sent out by the village as determined by the
village board.
Bills shall be computed by adding ten percent (10%) to the total sewer charges,
this total shall equal the gross bill. The net bill shall equal the gross bill
less the aforementioned ten percent (10%). The bills shall be mailed so as to
reach the consumer on the first day of the first month of the next billing
period. If the bill is paid within twenty (20) days of the mailing the net bill
shall be paid. If the bill is not paid within the twenty (20) days then a
"reminder - water bill past due" notice may be mailed. If the reminder bill is
not paid within ten (10) days from the second mailing, then a "final shut off
notice" shall be mailed notifying the consumer that water service will be
turned off if the gross bill is not paid within five (5) days. If the bill is
not paid the service shall then be turned off without additional notice.
The village board of trustees shall have the authority to reduce and/or waive
the charge or penalty for what may be determined to be sufficient and
justifiable reasons for any late payment or nonpayment.
   (B)   Lien; Notice Of Delinquency: Whenever a bill for sewer service remains
unpaid for thirty (30) days or one billing cycle whichever is longer after it
has been rendered, the village may file with the county recorder of deeds a
statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain the legal description of
the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the
village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to
the period covered by the bill.
If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the
village has notice of this, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the premises
if his address be known to the village, whenever such bill remains unpaid for
the period of forty five (45) days for a monthly bill or one hundred five (105)
days for a quarterly bill after it has been rendered.
The failure of the village to record such lien or to mail such notice or the
failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to
foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned in the foregoing subsection.
   (C)   Foreclosure Of Lien: Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges
shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be
applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the
foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be in the name of the
village. The village attorney will be authorized by the village board of
trustees and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the village
in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property.
   (D)   Revenues: All revenues and monies derived from the operation of the
sewerage system shall be deposited in the sewerage account of the sewerage
fund. All such revenues and monies shall be held by the village separate and
apart from private funds and separate and apart from all other funds of the
village and all of said sum, without any deductions whatever, shall be
delivered to the village not more than ten (10) days after receipt of same, or
at such more frequent intervals as may from time to time be directed by the
village president and board of trustees.
The village shall receive all such revenues from the wastewater collection and
all other funds and monies incident to the operation of such system as the same
may be delivered to it and deposit the same in the account of the fund
designated as the "sewerage fund of the village". Said treasurer shall
administer such fund in every respect in the manner provided by statute of the
"revised cities and villages act", effective January 1942.
   (E)   Accounts: The village shall establish a proper system of accounts and
shall keep proper books, records, and accounts in which complete and correct
entries shall be made of all transactions relative to the sewerage system, and
at regular annual intervals he shall cause to be made an audit by an
independent auditing concern of the books to show the receipts and
disbursements of the wastewater collection system.
In addition to the customary operating statements, the annual audit report
shall also reflect the revenues and operating expenses of the wastewater
collection system, including a replacement cost, to indicate that sewer service
charges under the waste cost recovery system do in fact meet these regulations.
In this regard, the financial information to be shown in the audit report shall
include the following:
      1.   Flow data showing total gallons discharged into the village sanitary
collection system for the current fiscal year.
      2.   Billing data to show total number of gallons billed per fiscal year.
      3.   Debt service for the next succeeding fiscal year.
      4.   Number of users connected to the system.

surface improvement, the village may require additional deposits or may assess
the property for the full improvement cost and use the deposit to pay off part
of the assessment. Any interest earned on the deposits may be used by the
village for any purposes, including, but not limited to, road maintenance,

4-23-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
It is the purpose and intent of the President and Board of Trustees to
establish a process to address crime, the deterioration and decline in value of
Village neighborhoods caused by properties with prolonged vacancies (in excess
of 30 days) or with defaulted mortgages, regardless of occupancy status located
within the Village, and to identify, regulate, limit and reduce the number of
these properties located within the Village. It is the intent of the President
and Board of Trustees to establish a registration program as a mechanism to
help protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate
maintenance of properties vacant beyond thirty (30) days, or that are in
default or defaulted, and to facilitate timely intervention by monitoring the
status of distressed and/or vacant properties. (Ord. 2035, 7-24-2019)
4-23-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly
indicates a different meaning.
DEFAULT: Shall mean that the mortgagor has not complied with the terms of the
mortgage on the property, or the promissory note, or other evidence of the
debt, referred to in the mortgage.
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Shall mean any law enforcement officer, building official,
zoning inspector, Code Enforcement Officer, fire inspector, building inspector,
or other person authorized by the Village to enforce the applicable ordinance
(s).
EVIDENCE OF VACANCY: Shall mean any condition that on its own, or combined with
other conditions present, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the
property is vacant. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to:
overgrown and/or dead vegetation; past due utility notices and/or disconnected
utilities; accumulation of trash, junk or debris; abandoned vehicles, auto
parts and/or materials; the absence of furnishings and/or personal items
consistent with habitation or occupancy; the presence of an unsanitary,
stagnant swimming pool; accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers and/or
mail; statements by neighbors, passers-by, delivery agents or government
agents; and/or the presence of boards over doors, windows or other openings in
violation of applicable ordinance(s).
FORECLOSURE OR FORECLOSURE ACTION: Shall mean the legal process by which a
mortgagee, or other lien holder, terminates or attempts to terminate a property
owner's equitable right of redemption to obtain legal and equitable title to
the real property pledged as security for a debt or the real property subject
to the lien. The legal process is not concluded until the real property
obtained by the mortgagee, lien holder, or their designee, by certificate of
title, or any other means, is sold to a non-related bona fide purchaser in an
arm's length transaction to satisfy the debt or lien.
MORTGAGEE: Shall mean the creditor, including but not limited to, trustees;
mortgage servicing companies; lenders in a mortgage agreement; any agent,
servant, or employee of the creditor; any successor in interest; or any
assignee of the creditor's rights, interests or obligations under the mortgage
agreement; or any other person or entity with the legal right to foreclose on
the real property, excluding governmental entities.
OWNER: Shall mean every person, entity, or mortgagee, who alone or severally
with others:
   (A)   Has legal or equitable title to any real property, dwelling, dwelling
unit, mobile dwelling unit, building, structure, parcel of land, vacant or
otherwise, including but not limited to, a mobile home park; or
   (B)   Has legal care, charge or control of any real property, dwelling,
dwelling unit, mobile dwelling unit, building, structure or parcel of land,
vacant or otherwise, including a mobile home park, in any capacity, including
but not limited to, agent, executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of the
estate of the holder of legal title; or
   (C)   Is a mortgagee in possession of any such property, or is a mortgagee
with actual control of access to the property by any means including, but not
limited to, changing locks or putting on a lock box; or
   (D)   Is an agent, trustee, or other person appointed by the courts and
vested with possession or control of any such property. The property manager
shall not be considered the owner.
PROPERTY MANAGER: Means any party designated by the owner as responsible for
inspecting, maintaining and securing real property as required in this chapter.

action by a mortgagee or trustee and a judgment has been entered, or has been
the subject of a foreclosure sale where the title was transferred to the
beneficiary of a mortgage involved in the foreclosure and any properties
transferred under a deed in lieu of foreclosure/sale. The designation of a
"default/foreclosure" property as "registrable" shall remain in place until
such time as the property is sold to a non-related bona fide purchaser in an
arm's length transaction or the foreclosure action has been dismissed and any
default on the mortgage has been cured; or
   (B)   Any property that is vacant for more than thirty (30) days or any
cancellation of utility or service, whichever occurs first.
REGISTRY: Shall mean a web-based electronic database of searchable real
property records, used by the Village to allow mortgagees the opportunity to
register defaulted properties and pay applicable fees as required in this
chapter.
SEMI-ANNUAL REGISTRATION: Shall mean six (6) months from the date of the first
action that requires registration, as determined by the Village, or its
designee, and every subsequent six (6). The date of the initial registration
may be different than the date of the first action that required registration.
UTILITIES AND SERVICES: Shall mean any utility and/or service that is essential
for a building to be habitable and/or perform a service necessary to comply
with all Village ordinance(s). This includes, but is not limited to,
electrical, gas, water, sewer, lawn maintenance, pool maintenance, and snow
removal.
VACANT: Shall mean any parcel of land in the Village that contains any building
or structure that is not lawfully occupied for more than thirty (30) days.

   (G)   Other information as the Village may require from time to time. (Ord.
2035, 7-24-2019; amd. Ord. 2127, 8-23-2023)
4-23-5: INSPECTION AND REGISTRATION OF DEFAULTED MORTGAGE:
   (A)   Any mortgagee who holds a mortgage on real property located within the
Village shall perform an inspection of the property upon it being in default or
defaulted by the mortgagor or prior to the issuance of a notice of default.
   (B)   Property inspected pursuant to subsection (A) of this section that
remains in default or defaulted, shall be inspected every thirty (30) days by
the mortgagee or mortgagee's designee. If an inspection shows a change in the
property's occupancy status the mortgagee shall, within ten (10) days of that
inspection, update the occupancy status of the property registration.
   (C)   Within ten (10) days of the date any mortgagee declares its mortgage
to be in default or defaulted, the mortgagee shall register the real property
with the Village's registry, and at the time of registration, indicate whether
the property is vacant, and if so shall designate in writing a property manager
to inspect, maintain and secure the real property subject to the mortgage in
default or defaulted. A separate registration is required for each defaulted
property.
   (D)   Initial registration pursuant to this section shall contain at a
minimum the name of the mortgagee, the mailing address of the mortgagee, e-mail
address, telephone number and name of the property manager and said person's
address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
   (E)   At the time of initial registration each registrant shall pay a non-
refundable semi-annual registration fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
for each defaulted property. Subsequent semi-annual registrations of defaulted
properties and fees in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) are
due within ten (10) days of the expiration of the previous registration. Any
registerable property remaining vacant after two (2) years shall pay subsequent
registration fees in the amount of three hundred dollars ($300.00) semi-
annually as provided by this chapter. Said fees shall be used to offset the
costs of: 1) registration and registration enforcement, 2) code enforcement and
mitigation related to defaulted properties, and 3) for any related purposes as
may be adopted in the policy set forth in this chapter. The Building
Superintendent of the Village shall be authorized to waive the fee requirements
of this chapter upon written petition of non-profit entities whose purpose and
effect are to reduce the number of registerable properties as provided for in
this chapter.
   (F)   If the defaulted mortgage and/or servicing on a property is sold or
transferred, the new mortgagee is subject to all the terms of this chapter.
Within ten (10) days of the transfer, the new mortgagee shall register the
defaulted property or update the existing registration. Any and all previous
unpaid fees, fines, and penalties, including but not limited to unregistered
periods during the foreclosure process shall be the responsibility of the
mortgagee at the time initial registration and/or semi-annual registrations
were required and are subject to enforcement per this chapter. If the mortgage
on a registrable property is sold or transferred, the new mortgagee is subject
to all the terms of this chapter, and within ten (10) days of the transfer or
sale shall update the existing registration. The previous mortgagee will not be
released from the responsibility of paying all previous unpaid fees, fines, and
penalties accrued during that mortgagee's involvement with the defaulted
property. The provisions of this subsection are cumulative with and in addition
to other available remedies. Moreover, the Village is authorized and empowered
to collect on the previous mortgagee's non-payment of previous fees, fines, and
penalties in any lawful manner.
   (G)   If the mortgagee sells or transfers the defaulted property in a non-
arm's length transaction to a related entity or person, the transferee is
subject to all the terms of this chapter, and within ten (10) days of the
transfer, shall register the defaulted property or update the existing
registration. Any and all previously unpaid fees, fines, and penalties,
regardless of who the mortgagee was at the time registration was required,
including but not limited to unregistered periods during the foreclosure
process, are the responsibility of the new owner of the foreclosed property and
are due and payable with the updated registration. The previous mortgagee will
not be released from the responsibility of paying all previously unpaid fees,
fines, and penalties accrued during that mortgagee's involvement with the
defaulted property. The provisions of this subsection are cumulative with and
in addition to other available remedies.
   (H)   If the defaulted property is not registered, or either the
registration fee or the semi-annual registration fee is not paid within thirty
(30) days of when the registration or semi-annual registration is required
pursuant to this section, a late fee equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the
semi-annual registration fee shall be charged for every thirty-day period, or
portion thereof, the property is not registered and shall be due and payable
with the registration. This section shall apply to the initial registration and
registrations required by subsequent owners of the defaulted mortgage and/or
defaulted property. Registrations delinquent greater than thirty (30) days are
also subject to additional fines as described herein.
   (I)   This section shall also apply to properties that have been the subject
of a foreclosure sale where title is transferred to the mortgagee as well as
any properties transferred to the mortgagee under a deed in lieu of foreclosure
or by any other legal means.
   (J)   Properties subject to this section shall remain subject to the semi-
annual registration requirement, and the inspection, security, and maintenance
standards of this section as long as the mortgage is under foreclosure or in
default or defaulted. Until the mortgage or lien on the property in question is
satisfied, or legally discharged, the desire to no longer pursue foreclosure,
the filing of a dismissal of lis pendens and/or summary of final judgment and/
or certificate of title, voluntary or otherwise, does not exempt any mortgagee
holding the defaulted mortgage, from all the requirements of this chapter as
long as the borrower is in default.
   (K)   Failure of the mortgagee and/or property owner of record to properly
register or to modify the registration to reflect a change of circumstances as
required by this chapter is a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to
enforcement by any of the enforcement means available to the Village.
   (L)   If any property is in violation of this chapter the Village may take
the necessary action to ensure compliance and recover the cost of the
outstanding obligation and any additional cost incurred to bring the property
into compliance. (Ord. 2035, 7-24-2019)
4-23-6: INSPECTION AND REGISTRATION OF VACANT PROPERTY:
   (A)   Any owner of vacant property located within the Village shall within
thirty (30) days after the property becomes vacant, or within ten (10) days
after assuming ownership of the property, whichever is later, register the real
property with the Village of Midlothian Registry.
   (B)   Initial registration pursuant to this section shall contain at a
minimum the name of the owner, the mailing address of the owner, e-mail
address, and telephone number of the owner, and if applicable, the name and
telephone number of the property manager and said person's address, e-mail
address, and telephone number.
   (C)   At the initial registration each registrant shall pay a non-
refundable semi-annual registration fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
for each vacant property. Subsequent semi- annual registrations of vacant
properties and fees in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) are
due within ten (10) days of the expiration of the previous registration. Any
registerable property remaining vacant after two (2) years shall pay subsequent
registration fees in the amount of three hundred dollars ($300.00) semi-
annually as provided by this chapter. Said fees shall be used to offset the
costs of: 1) registration and registration enforcement, 2) code enforcement and
mitigation related to vacant properties, and 3) for any related purposes as may
be adopted in the policy set forth in this chapter.
   (D)   Each individual property on the registry that has been registered for
twelve (12) months or more prior to the effective date shall have thirty (30)
days to renew the registration and pay the semi-annual registration fee as
required by subsection (C) of this section.
   (E)   If the property is sold or transferred, the new owner is subject to
all the terms of this chapter. Within ten (10) days of the transfer, the new
owner shall register the vacant property or update the existing registration.
The previous owner(s) will not be released from the responsibility of paying
all previous unpaid fees, fines, and penalties accrued during the owner's
involvement with the vacant property.
   (F)   If the vacant property is not registered, or either the registration
fee or the semi-annual registration fee is not paid within thirty (30) days of
when the registration or semi-annual registration is required pursuant to this
section, a late fee equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the semi-annual
registration fee shall be charged for every thirty (30) day period, or portion
thereof, the property is not registered and shall be due and payable with the
registration. This section shall apply to the initial registration and
registrations required by subsequent owners of the vacant property.
   (G)   Properties subject to this section shall remain subject to the semi-
annual registration requirement, and the inspection, security, and maintenance
standards of this section as long as the property is vacant.
   (H)   Failure of the owner to properly register or to modify the
registration to reflect a change of circumstances as required by this chapter
is a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to enforcement by any of
the enforcement means available to the Village of Midlothian.
   (I)   If any property is in violation of this chapter the Village of
Midlothian may take the necessary action to ensure compliance with and place a
lien on the property for the cost of the outstanding obligation and any
additional cost incurred to bring the property into compliance.
   (J)   Properties registered as a result of this section are not required to
be registered again pursuant to the defaulted mortgage property section.
   (K)   Rental properties registered in compliance with section 4-19-7 of this
title shall be exempt from registration under this chapter. (Ord. 2035, 7-24-

the purchaser or is excused from collecting the tax under this section, then

and pay the tax directly to the Village Treasurer on or before the last day of
the month following the month during which the electricity is used or consumed.
   (E)   Resales:

receiving the electricity has an active resale number issued by the Village
Treasurer and furnishes that number to the person who delivers the electricity,
and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially
nontaxable as a sale for resale.
      2.   If a person who receives electricity in the Village claims to be an
authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the Village
Treasurer for a resale number. The applicant shall state facts showing why it
is not liable for the tax imposed by this chapter on any purchases of
electricity and shall furnish such additional information as the Village
Treasurer may reasonably require.

discontinued making resales.
      5.   (a) If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or
consumption and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by
this section directly to the Village Treasurer on the amount of electricity
that the reseller uses or consumes, and shall collect and remit the tax on the

         (b)   Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an
active resale number and complying with all other conditions of this section
shall be excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the
electricity delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports to the
Village Treasurer the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller,
and such other information that the Village Treasurer may reasonably require.
   (F)   Books And Records: Every tax collector, and every taxpayer required to
pay the tax imposed by this chapter, shall keep accurate books and records of
its business or activity, including contemporaneous books and records denoting
the transactions that gave rise, or may have given rise, to any tax liability
under this chapter. The books and records shall be subject to and available for
inspection at all times during business hours of the day.
   (G)   Credits And Refunds: Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section in order to permit sound fiscal planning and budgeting by the Village,

this chapter unless the person files a claim for refund or credit within one
year after the date on which the tax was paid or remitted to the Village
Treasurer. (Ord. 1460, 5-12-1999, eff. 8-1-1999)

person, business or activity which, under the Constitutions of the United

purchaser is billed by a public utility on or after September 1, 2018.

fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be: a) credited against any tax
due, or to become due, under this section from the taxpayer who made the

due; provided that no amounts erroneously paid more than three (3) years prior

the amount of the village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the village by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the village plus five percent
(5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit. If the
audit indicates that the underpayment was more than three percent (3%) of the

then the telecommunications retailer shall reimburse the village for any costs
incurred by the village in conducting the audit. Any amounts payable to the
village pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the village within twenty
one (21) days after the date of issuance of an invoice for same.

determination that there will be a controlled rotating interruption of electric
service pursuant to the emergency energy plan. The notification shall include

notification be made less than thirty (30) minutes prior to the outages, if the
company is aware that controlled rotating interruptions may be required.

is secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the ground no less
than two feet (2'). A permit must be obtained prior to the construction of any
pen. The enclosure must be humane and provide some protection from the elements
for the animal. Whenever off the premises of its owner, said animal shall be

this chapter by instituting an ordinance enforcement action.
   (B)   Seeking to enjoin the continuation of the nuisance by the filing of a
lawsuit in a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 999, 5-27-1981)
8-4-4: SUMMARY ABATEMENT:
Whenever, in the opinion of an officer of the village possessing police powers,
the maintenance or continuation of a nuisance creates an imminent threat of
serious injury to persons or serious damage to personal or real property, or if
the nuisance can be abated summarily without or with only minor damage to the
items or premises which are creating the nuisance, and the continuation of the
nuisance poses a substantial threat of injury to persons or property or a
substantial interference with the quiet enjoyment of the life normally present
in the community, such officer shall proceed to abate such nuisance; provided,
further, that whenever the owner, occupant, agent or person in possession,
charge or control of the real or personal property which has become a nuisance
is unknown or cannot readily be found, the municipal officer with police power
may proceed to abate such nuisance without notice. Where the abatement of the
nuisance requires continuing acts by the corporate authorities beyond the
initial summary abatement and any other additional emergency abatements, it
shall seek abatement of such nuisance on a permanent basis through judicial
process as soon as reasonably possible. (Ord. 999, 5-27-1981)
8-4-5: COST OF ABATEMENT; LIEN:
In either case provided by the two (2) previous sections, the expense of such
abatement shall be collected from the person who may have created, continued or
suffered such nuisance to exist. The village may file a lien for the cost
against any real estate whereupon the nuisance existed. (Ord. 999, 5-27-1981)
8-4-6: PENALTY:
Any individual, firm or association or corporation violating any of the
provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than the
penalty as provided in section 1-4-1 of this code or the maximum allowed by
state statutes for each offense. Each day that a violation is allowed to exist
shall constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 999, 5-27-1981; amd. Ord. 1362, 9-
13-1995)
8-4-7: REWARD:
   (A)   The village board recognizes that it is in the best interests of the
village to help abate nuisance or trespass on village property or property of
others within the village. To further this goal, the village will provide a
reward to anyone supplying information leading to the conviction of any person
involved in creating a nuisance or trespass on property of the village or of
any private person or business.
   (B)   The village board offers a reward of twenty five dollars ($25.00) for
anyone providing information or evidence leading to the conviction in a court
of law of any individual who causes a nuisance or trespass on the property of
the village or a private person or business. In the instance of one or more
individuals providing the evidence or testimony, the reward will be shared.
   (C)   A nuisance is any action as set forth in this chapter, and includes,
but is not limited to, dumping or depositing anything of an offensive nature on
a public way or on private property. (Ord. 1551, 7-24-2002)

8-5-11: Entrances, Exits, Windows And Ventilation Intakes
8-5-1: FINDINGS:
The village board makes the following findings:
   (A)   That the Illinois general assembly has passed the smoke free Illinois
act 1  which prohibits smoking in all public places, government buildings,
government owned vehicles and places of employment, with certain specified
exceptions.
   (B)   That section 65 of the smoke free Illinois act 2  allows any nonhome
rule municipality to regulate smoking, as long as such regulations or ordinance
is not less restrictive than the smoke free Illinois act.
   (C)   That the village board adopts the findings of the Illinois general
assembly as annunciated in the smoke free Illinois act as follows:
      The General Assembly finds that tobacco smoke is a harmful and dangerous
carcinogen to human beings and a hazard to public health. Secondhand tobacco
smoke causes at least 65,000 deaths each year from heart disease and lung
cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. Secondhand tobacco smoke
causes heart disease, stroke, cancer, sudden infant death syndrome, low birth
weight in infants, asthma and exacerbation of asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia
in children and adults. Secondhand tobacco smoke is the third leading cause of
preventable death in the United States. Illinois workers exposed to secondhand
tobacco smoke are at increased risk of premature death. An estimated 2,900
Illinois citizens die each year from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke.
      The General Assembly also finds that the United States Surgeon General's
2006 report has determined that there is no risk-free level of exposure to
secondhand smoke; the scientific evidence that secondhand smoke causes serious
diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses such
as bronchitis and asthma, is massive and conclusive; separating smokers from
nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate
secondhand smoke exposure; smoke free workplace policies are effective in
reducing secondhand smoke exposure; and smoke free workplace policies do not
have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry.
      The General Assembly also finds that the Environmental Protection Agency
has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in
businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are capable only
of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the
known toxins in secondhand smoke. The American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation
standards on totally smoke free environments because it cannot determine a safe
level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains cancer causing chemicals,
and ASHRAE acknowledges that technology does not exist that can remove
chemicals that cause cancer from the air. A June 30, 2005 ASHRAE position
document on secondhand smoke concludes that, at present, the only means of
eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to eliminate all
smoking activity indoors.

9-12-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
   (A)   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights of way within the village
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights of way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation,
to:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the village residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities Subject To Chapter: This chapter applies to all facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of way within
the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established prior to the
effective date hereof may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by
the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise
provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses Or Similar Agreements: The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights of way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   (E)   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights of way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. 1652, 10-10-2007)

all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held
at a date, time and place designated by the village with such village
representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall
be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing
special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including,
without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area
and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights of way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.

harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 1652, 10-10-2007)
9-12-10: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the village superintendent of public works, and may
also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village
superintendent of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow
the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to
each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security
fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would
have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single
phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund;
provided, that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village; provided, that any
such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in subsection (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation;
provided, that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 1652, 10-10-
2007)

right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
village superintendent of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of
the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for

public works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the
variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions For Granting Of Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the village superintendent of public works may require
the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village
superintendent of public works under the provisions of this chapter shall have
the right to appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as
it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to
the village clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,

with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 1652, 10-10-2007)
9-12-23: ENFORCEMENT:

conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
      The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific
Code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and
send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Village denies
an application.
      The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village and
resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of
denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee.
The Village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30)
days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved.
Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial
shall require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees,
and recommencement of the Village's review period.
      The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to
proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
      Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies
cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the
cure requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be
collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.
         (e)   Within thirty (30) days after an approved permit to collocate a
small wireless facility on a Municipal utility pole, the Village and the

into a License Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment Agreement.
      3.   Completeness Of Application: Within thirty (30) days after receiving
an application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village.
   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice
of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      4.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
         (b)   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      5.   Consolidated Applications: An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village
may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter.

permits shall be subject to the applicable Village Code provisions or
regulations in effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the Village by personal
delivery at the Village's designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail.
   (C)   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance
with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
   The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on
such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code
of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Electric Distribution Or Transmission System: The wireless provider
shall not collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are
part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the
communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the
pole.
   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
   For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Public Safety: The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
      6.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive
plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which
small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility
pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in
place on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located
within three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or
wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         (b)   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a special use permit, variance or administrative waiver as the
case may be in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in
title 11, chapter 2, part 2 of this Code.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty

require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing
until such portion of the load is removed as may be necessary to reduce the
gross weight of such vehicle to such limits as permitted under this section and
shall forthwith charge the driver for violating this section. All material so
unloaded shall be cared for by the owner or operator of such vehicle at the
risk of such owner or operator.

this section, the owner or driver, or both, of such vehicle shall be deemed
guilty of such violation, and the owner or driver, or both, of such vehicle may

   QUARTERLY PERMITS: Those trips that are known to be continuous in nature and
shall be for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date of issuance.
   ROUND TRIP MOVEMENT: Two (2) trips over the same route in opposite

      4.   The owner or agent shall submit an application fee found in this

trip routing valid for fourteen (14) calendar days, quarterly permits valid for
a base period of ninety (90) days, and a yearly permit valid for three hundred
sixty five (365) days. Permits are valid only for the date periods specified on

the chief or designee. No substitution of vehicle, load, or routing is
permitted without the expressed written permission of the chief or designee,
and the permit must be carried in the vehicle to which the permit applies.
      5.   The chief or designee is authorized to approve the application upon
verification with the public works director or designee for approved routes.
Upon approval and payment of all required fees, the police department shall
issue a permit allowing passage of the oversize and/or overweight vehicles over
village streets. The permit shall be specific and contain:

that are consistent and reasonable for the protection of the general public and
streets.
      6.   It is the duty of the permittee to read and be familiar with the
permit provisions. Undertaking of the permit trip is deemed prima facie
evidence of acceptance of the permit provisions and that:
         (a)   The permittee is in compliance with all operation requirements;
         (b)   No dimension and weight limitations specified in the permit will
be exceeded;
         (c)   All operation, registration, and license requirements have been

to persons or to public or private property, including his or her own, or to
the object being transported, caused directly or indirectly by the
transportation or movement of vehicles and objects authorized under the permit.
The permittee agrees to hold the village harmless from all suits, claims,
damages, or proceedings of any kind and to indemnify the village for any claim
it may be required to pay arising from the movement.
      7.   The permit shall be carried in the vehicle to which the permit
applies at all times while operating on streets within the village and shall be
exhibited upon demand to any law enforcement officer, police officer, or
authorized village official. Electronic copies of the permit are acceptable
provided the police officer is able to inspect the permit on the device used by
the driver. If there are any discrepancies between the written items upon the
applicant's copy and the village's copy of the permit, the village's copy shall
be considered correct. The permit is void if any of the printed widths,
lengths, heights, or weight limits have been changed or altered.
      8.   Whenever any vehicle is operated in violation of the provisions of a
village permit, whether by size, weight, or general provisions, and either or
both the owner and driver of such vehicle, shall be deemed guilty and either or
both the owner and driver of such vehicle may be prosecuted for such violation.
   (G)   Construction Vehicles: For purposes of this section, a construction
vehicle is any vehicle operated for the transportation of persons or property
in the furtherance of any commercial or industrial enterprise, for hire or not
for hire, but not including a commuter van, a vehicle used in a ridesharing
arrangement when being used for that purpose, or a recreational vehicle not
being used commercially. It shall be unlawful to operate any construction
vehicle on any street in the village when signs are posted on that street
prohibiting construction vehicles. Where the chief, with the approval of the
village board, establishes a truck route, construction vehicles will utilize
only those established routes to service those areas of the village under
construction.
   (H)   Penalty: Any person, firm, or corporation who or which violates,
disobeys, neglects, fails to comply with, or resists enforcement of the
provisions of this section shall be fined pursuant to this code up to an amount
of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). A separate offense shall be deemed
committed on each calendar day a violation occurs.
In addition to seeking a fine, the village attorney may institute any proper
action in the name of the village to enjoin the violation of any provision of
this section. (Ord. 1917, 3-23-2016)

      3.   A posttowing notice shall be mailed to the registered owner of a
vehicle which was towed and/or impounded within ten (10) calendar days of the
towing and impoundment. The notice shall provide the following: a) the date and

11-2-16: SPECIAL USES:
   (A)   Establishment And Purpose: The village has previously established the
process for considering applications for special uses. This title is based upon
the division of the village into districts, within which the use of land and
buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures are essentially
uniform. However, there are special uses, which, because of their unique
character, cannot be properly classified in a particular district(s) without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands
and upon the public need for the particular use at the particular location. The
special use process addresses these unique circumstances and regulates such
uses to protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general
welfare. Such special uses fall into two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly related utilities, or
uses traditionally maintained for the public interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Initiation Of Special Uses: Any person having a right of ownership or
right of possession in any property in the village may request a special use.
All applications for special uses shall be filed with the village clerk in
accordance with the requirements in section 11-2-7, "Applications", of this
chapter.
   (C)   Authority And Execution: The village board, after receiving a
recommendation by the zoning board of appeals, shall take formal action on
special use requests.
   (D)   Procedure:
      1.   Acceptance Of Application By Village Clerk: Upon receipt of an
application, the village clerk shall review the application for completeness.
The village clerk shall send the application to the site plan review committee
for review and schedule the application for an upcoming zoning board of appeals
agenda for consideration.
      2.   Site Plan Review: The site plan review committee shall review the
application, related documentation and plans in accordance with section 11-2-14
of this chapter. Their findings shall be submitted along with the completed
application to the zoning board of appeals.
      3.   Recommendation By Zoning Board Of Appeals:
         (a)   The zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing in
accordance with section 11-2-8, "Public Hearings", of this chapter, that will
be held within forty five (45) days of the filing of the completed application,
unless the zoning board of appeals is unable to meet for any reason, in which
case the application will be heard at the next meeting. Notice for the public
hearing shall be in accordance with section 11-2-9, "Public Notices", of this
chapter.
         (b)   Within thirty (30) days of the close of the public hearing, the
zoning board of appeals shall forward its findings of fact and recommendation
of either approval, approval with conditions, or denial on applications for
special uses to the village board.
      4.   Action By Village Board: The village board shall consider the
application within thirty (30) days of receiving the findings of fact and
recommendation from the zoning board of appeals but may postpone final decision
for an additional thirty (30) days for any reason. The village board may take
action in the form of approval, approval with conditions, or denial of
applications for special uses. The village board may also refer the matter back
to the zoning board of appeals for further consideration.
   (E)   Standards For Special Uses: Zoning board of appeals recommendation and
village board decision on any special use is a matter of legislative discretion
that is not controlled by any one standard. An application for a special use
shall not be approved unless the application is determined to be in substantial
conformance with each of the following standards, in addition to any specific
use standards included in chapter 9, "Use Standards", of this title:
      1.   The proposed special use is, in fact, a special use authorized in
the zoning district in which the property is located.
      2.   The proposed special use is deemed necessary for the public
convenience at that location.
      3.   The proposed special use does not create excessive additional
impacts at public expense for public facilities and services, and will be
beneficial to the economic welfare of the community.
      4.   The proposed use is in conformance with the goals and policies of
the comprehensive plan, and all village codes and regulations.
      5.   The proposed special use will be designed, located, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and compatible in use and appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity.
      6.   The proposed special use is a suitable use of the property to
generate income from an appropriate business and, without the special use, the
property will be substantially diminished in value.
      7.   The proposed special use will not significantly diminish the safety,
use, enjoyment and value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is
located.
      8.   The proposed special use is compatible with development on adjacent
property.
      9.   The proposed special use minimizes potentially dangerous traffic
movements, and provides adequate and safe ingress and egress to the site.

spaces and maintains parking areas in accordance with the requirements of this
title.
      11.   The proposed special use is served by adequate utilities, drainage,
road access, public safety and other necessary facilities.
      12.   The proposed special use conforms with the requirements of this
title and other applicable regulations.
      13.   The applicant's experience, expertise and previous ownership and/or
management of similar businesses may be beneficial to the special use.
      14.   Otherwise complies with all state statutes and village ordinances.
   (F)   No Presumption Of Approval: The listing of a use as a special use
within a zoning district does not constitute an assurance or presumption that
such special use will be approved. Rather each proposed special use shall be
evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to the standards in this section,
the standards in chapter 9, "Use Standards", of this title, and the standards
for the district in which it is located. Such evaluation will determine whether
approval of the special use is appropriate at the particular location and in
the particular manner proposed.
   (G)   Conditions On Special Uses: The zoning board of appeals may recommend,
and the village board may impose, such conditions and restrictions upon the
construction, location and operation of a special use. Such conditions must be
deemed necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this section, to
promote the general objectives of this title, and to minimize or reduce the
injury to the value of property in the neighborhood. Such conditions shall be
expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Failure to
maintain such conditions or restrictions as may have been imposed shall
constitute grounds for revocation of such special use approval.
   (H)   Limitations On Special Uses:
      1.   Special use approval may become null and void unless a building
permit is issued and construction is completed within six (6) months, or a
certificate of occupancy is issued and the premises are occupied within ninety
(90) days, of the date of adoption of the ordinance granting special use
approval. After notice to the property owner and an opportunity for a hearing,
the village board may terminate the special use. However, the village board may
extend this period upon written request from the applicant showing good cause.
      2.   Special use approval is granted to a specific property and
authorizes the conduct of the special use only on the property represented on
the application and is not transferable to other properties or subsequent
owners or tenants.
      3.   The approval of a special use authorizes the use on the property in
the manner proposed, but does not in itself authorize the establishment of such
use without first obtaining any other required approvals, including a building
permit, sign permit, certificate of occupancy, zoning certificate and site plan
review.
      4.   Any modification or intensification of a special use that alters the
essential character or operation of the use in a way not approved at the time
the special use was granted, as evidenced by the record or by the text of this
title, shall require new special use approval in accordance with this section.
      5.   If a property or building which has been granted a special use is
vacated for sixty (60) consecutive days, the special use is deemed null and
void.
      6.   If the owner of the property and the owner/tenant of the business
are different, both parties must sign the special use application and special
use ordinance.
   (I)   Fees: Fees shall be established by the village board. A current copy
of the fee schedule shall be available, upon request, in the office of the
village clerk.
   (J)   Records Of Special Uses: The village clerk shall keep a record of all
special uses on file and copies shall be available on request, to any person
for a fee specified in the fee schedule, which shall be kept on file in the
office of the village clerk. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-2-17: VARIATIONS:
   (A)   Establishment And Purpose: The village has previously established the
process for review of variation requests. The process is to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications
of this title that create practical difficulties or particular hardships.
   (B)   Initiation Of Variations: Any person having a right of ownership or
right of possession in any property in the village may request a variation. All
applications for variations shall be filed with the village clerk in accordance
with the requirements in section 11-2-7, "Applications", of this chapter.
   (C)   Authority And Execution: The village board, after receiving a
recommendation by the zoning board of appeals, shall take formal action on
variation requests.
   (D)   Procedure:
      1.   Acceptance Of Application By Village Clerk: Upon receipt of an
application, the village clerk shall review the application for completeness.
The village clerk shall send the application to the site plan review committee
for review and schedule the application for an upcoming zoning board of appeals
agenda for consideration.
      2.   Site Plan Review: The site plan review committee shall review the
application, related documentation and plans in accordance with section 11-2-
4 of this chapter. Their findings shall be submitted along with the completed
application to the zoning board of appeals.
      3.   Recommendation By Zoning Board Of Appeals:
         (a)   The zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing in
accordance with section 11-2-8, "Public Hearings", of this chapter, that will
be held within forty five (45) days of the filing of the completed application,
unless the zoning board of appeals is unable to meet for any reason, in which
case the application will be heard at the next meeting. Notice for the public
hearing shall be in accordance with section 11-2-9, "Public Notices", of this
chapter.
         (b)   Within thirty (30) days of the close of the public hearing, the
zoning board of appeals shall forward its findings of fact and recommendation
of either approval, approval with conditions, or denial on applications for
variations to the village board.
      4.   Action By Village Board: The village board shall consider the
application within thirty (30) days of receiving the findings of fact and
recommendation from the zoning board of appeals but may postpone a final
decision for an additional thirty (30) days for any reason. The village board
may take action in the form of approval, approval with conditions, or denial of
requests for variations. The village board may also refer the matter back to
the zoning board of appeals for further consideration. Any variation for which
the zoning board of appeals recommends denial may be approved by a favorable
majority vote of the village board.
   (E)   Findings Of Fact For Variations: A variation from the provisions of
this title shall not be granted unless the zoning board of appeals in its
recommendation, and village board in its decision, make specific findings of
fact directly based on the standards and conditions imposed by this section.
The standards for variations shall be as follows:
      1.   Hardship: No variation shall be granted unless the applicant shall
establish that carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this title
would create a practical difficulty or particular hardship.
      2.   Unique Physical Conditions: The subject property is exceptional, as
compared to other properties subject to the same provisions, by means of a
unique physical condition, including irregular or substandard size, shape or
configuration, exceptional topographical features, or presence of an existing
use, structure or sign, whether conforming or nonconforming, or other
extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to, and inherent in, the subject
property that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the property owner,
and that relate to, or arise out of, the characteristics of the property rather
than the personal situation or preference of the current property owner.
      3.   Not Self-Created: The aforesaid unique physical condition is not the
result of any action or inaction of the property owner, or his/her predecessors
in title, and that it existed at the time of enactment of the provisions from
which a variation is sought, was created by natural forces, or was the result
of governmental action, other than the adoption of this title.
      4.   Denied Substantial Rights: The carrying out of the strict letter of
provision from which a variation is sought would deprive the owner of the
subject property of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other
properties subject to the same provisions.
      5.   Not Merely Special Privilege: The alleged hardship or difficulty is
neither merely the inability of the owner or occupants to enjoy some special
privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of other
lots or properties subject to the same provisions, nor merely the inability of
the owner to gain a greater financial return from the use of the subject
property.
      6.   Conformance With Title And Plan Purposes: The variation would not
result in a use of development of the subject property that would not be in
harmony with the general and specific purposes of this title, including the
provision from which a variation is sought, or the general purpose and intent
of the comprehensive plan.
      7.   No Other Remedy: There is no means, other than granting the
requested variation, by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided
or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the subject
property.
      8.   Minimum Relief Required: The requested variation is the minimum
measure of relief necessary to alleviate the alleged hardship or difficulty
presented by the strict application of this title.
      9.   Additional Criteria For Sign Variations: Within thirty (30) days
after the denial of a sign permit by the superintendent of buildings, a request
for variance in height or size may be filed with the zoning board of appeals.
The zoning board of appeals may hold a hearing and make its recommendation to
the village board. The zoning board of appeals may recommend granting the
variation if it finds that the unusual shape or topography of the property in
question prevents signage allowable under the provisions of this title from
adequately identifying the business or other activity on such property. The
zoning board of appeals may recommend a variance only to allow the area or
height of a sign to be increased by up to twenty five percent (25%) of the
maximum allowable height or area. If the request for variance is based upon
building materials, the request must be made to the village board, in writing,
within thirty (30) days after the denial of the permit by the superintendent of
buildings. All appeals to the zoning board of appeals shall require payment of
appropriate fees and filing of applicable forms.
   (F)   Variation Less Than Requested: The zoning board of appeals may
recommend and the village board may grant variations less than or different
from that requested when the record supports the applicant's right to some
relief, but not to the entire relief requested.
   (G)   Conditions On Variations: The zoning board of appeals may recommend,
and the village board may impose, specific conditions and restrictions
concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening and
other matters that address the purposes and objectives of this title, upon any
property that is granted a variation. These conditions may be necessary or
appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and
improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities
or services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance or
order granting the variation. Failure to maintain such conditions or
restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation
of the variation.
   (H)   Limitations On Variations:
      1.   Variations may become null and void unless a building permit is
issued and construction is actually begun within six (6) months of granting the
variation and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. After notice to
the property owner and an opportunity for a hearing, the village board may
terminate the variation. However, the village board may extend this period,
upon written request from the applicant showing good cause.
      2.   A variation is granted to a specific property and authorizes the
conduct of the variation only on the property represented on the application
and is not transferable to other properties or other owners or tenants.
      3.   The approval of a variation only authorizes the particular
construction or development for which it was issued, but does not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use, nor development, construction,
reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or structure without first
obtaining any other required permit, including a zoning certificate, building
permit and certificate of occupancy. The approved variation shall automatically
expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such construction or
development is beyond the scope so authorized.
   (I)   Fees: Fees shall be established by the village board. A current copy
of the fee schedule shall be available, upon request, in the office of the
village clerk.
   (J)   Records Of Variations: A record of all requests for variations,
including village action taken, shall be kept on file in the office of the
village clerk and copies shall be available, upon request, to any person for a
fee specified in the fee schedule, which shall be kept on file in the office of
the village clerk. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-2-18: ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS:
   (A)   Establishment And Purpose: The village hereby establishes the process
for review of appeals of decisions of the superintendent of buildings, or his/
her designee, or the site plan review committee with regard to sign permit,
zoning certificate, certificate of occupancy and building permit to provide
appropriate checks and balances on administrative authority.
   (B)   Initiation Of Appeals: Applications for appeals may be filed by the
owner, or any person having a right of ownership or possession in any property
in the village that is directly affected by an administrative decision made

the village clerk in accordance with the requirements in section 11-2-7,
"Applications", of this chapter.

action on administrative appeals. The decision of the superintendent of
buildings, or his/her designee, or the site plan review committee on building
permits, certificates of occupancy, sign permits, zoning certificates or site
plan reviews can be appealed. Other duties, decisions and actions of the
superintendent, which are not established by this title, cannot be appealed
under this process.
   (D)   Procedure:
      1.   Acceptance Of Application By Village Clerk: Upon receipt of an
application, the village clerk shall review the application for completeness.
The village clerk shall schedule the application for an upcoming zoning board
of appeals agenda for consideration.
      2.   Decision By Zoning Board Of Appeals: The zoning board of appeals

modify the order, requirement, decision or determination.
   (E)   Limitations On Appeals: A decision of the superintendent or the site
plan review committee may only be appealed if an application is filed within

clerk.
   (H)   Appeals To Village Board: An appeal of a decision to deny the issuance
of a sign permit, zoning certificate, certificate of occupancy or building
permit may be made in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of the decision
by filing a written request with the village clerk for the village board to
review the decision to deny issuance of the permit or certificate. The village
board shall consider the request within thirty (30) days of receiving same but
may postpone final decision for an additional thirty (30) days for any reason.
The village board may take action in the form of concurrence with the decision
to deny issuance of the permit/certificate or resolve to issue the permit or
certificate. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-2-19: ZONING INTERPRETATIONS:
   (A)   Establishment And Purpose: The village hereby establishes a process
for rendering zoning interpretations. The interpretation authority established
by this section is intended to recognize that the provisions of this title,
though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every
specific situation to which they may have to be applied. Many such situations
can be readily addressed by an interpretation of the specific provisions of
this title in light of the general and specific provisions for which those
provisions have been enacted. The interpretation authority established herein
is not intended to add or change the essential content of the ordinance, but is
intended to only allow authoritative application of that content to specific
cases.
   (B)   Initiation Of Interpretations: Applications for zoning interpretations
may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a right of possession in,
any property in the village, that gives rise to the need for an interpretation.
In addition, the village board, superintendent of buildings, or other village
official may request that the village board render an interpretation. All
applications for interpretations shall be filed with the village clerk in
accordance with the requirements in section 11-2-7, "Applications", of this
chapter. If an applicant would like to make a formal presentation before the
village board, it shall be noticed in accordance with section 11-2-8, "Public
Notices", of this chapter.
   (C)   Authority And Execution: The village board shall hear and make final
decisions on requests for interpretations.
   (D)   Procedure:
      1.   Acceptance Of Application By Village Clerk: Upon receipt of an
application, the village clerk shall review the application for completeness.
The village clerk shall schedule the application for an upcoming village board
meeting for consideration.
      2.   Decision By Village Board: The village board shall hear a request
for an interpretation within a reasonable time, and shall give due notice
thereof to the parties, and render the interpretation within a reasonable time.
The village board shall have the ability to request additional information
prior to rendering an interpretation.
   (E)   Fees: Fees shall be established by the village board. A current copy
of the fee schedule shall be available, upon request, in the office of the
village clerk.
   (F)   Records Of Zoning Interpretations: A record of all zoning
interpretations shall be kept on file in the office of the village clerk and
copies shall be available on request, to any person for a fee specified in the

(Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-2-20: ANNEXATIONS:
   (A)   Establishment And Purpose: The village hereby establishes the process
for the annexation of property to the village. Property to be annexed must be
contiguous to the village as that term is defined in the Illinois municipal
code.
   (B)   Initiation Of Annexations: Any property owner desiring annexation to
the village may submit an annexation petition to the village clerk. Any
property owner desiring annexation to the village contingent to a zoning
classification other than R-1 single-family residential, or requiring a special
use permit, may submit an annexation petition to the village clerk conditioning
such annexation upon obtaining the stipulated zoning or special use permit. The
application for obtaining a particular zoning classification must follow the
procedures outlined in section 11-2-15, "Zoning Text And Map Amendments", of
this chapter, and be submitted at the time of the submission of the petition
for annexation. The application for obtaining a special use permit must follow
the procedures outlined in section 11-2-16, "Special Uses", of this chapter,
and also be submitted at the time of the submission of the petition for
annexation. The property owner shall pay an application fee at the time of the
application as provided in the fee schedule as established by the village board
and kept on file in the office of the village clerk. The application fee for
the zoning map amendment, and the application fee for a special use permit
shall also be paid at the time of submission. If the annexed property is to
remain in the R-1 single-family residential zoning classification, an
application for a zoning map amendment and the fee for that application will
not be required. If the proposed use of the property does not require a special
use permit, the application for a special use permit and the fee for that
application will not be required. All applications for annexation shall be
filed with the village clerk in accordance with the requirements of section 11-
2-7, "Applications", of this chapter. If the requested zoning change or special
use permit is refused by the zoning board of appeals and/or the village board,
the property owner may withdraw the petition to annex, but shall not receive a
refund of any fees paid to the village.
   (C)   Authority And Execution: The village board, after receiving a
recommendation by the zoning board of appeals, shall take formal action on
annexation petitions.
   (D)   Procedure:

complete application, the village clerk shall review the application for
completeness. The village clerk shall send the application to the site plan
review committee for review and schedule the application for an upcoming zoning
board of appeals agenda for consideration.
      2.   Site Plan Review: The site plan review committee shall review the
application, related documentation and plans in accordance with section 11-2-
4 of this chapter. Their findings shall be submitted along with the completed
application to the zoning board of appeals.
      3.   Recommendation By Zoning Board Of Appeals: The zoning board of
appeals shall hold a public hearing in accordance with section 11-2-8, "Public
Hearings", of this chapter, that will be held within thirty (30) days of the
filing of the completed application, unless the zoning board of appeals is
unable to meet for any reason, in which case the application will be heard at
the next available meeting date. Notices for the public hearing shall be in
accordance with section 11-2-9, "Public Notices", of this chapter. The zoning
board of appeals shall consider the findings of the site plan review committee
and any additional testimony presented at the public hearing before reporting
their findings of fact and recommendation.
      4.   Action Of Village Board:
         (a)   The village board shall consider the application within thirty
(30) days of receiving the findings of fact and recommendation from the zoning
board of appeals but may postpone consideration for an additional thirty (30)
days. If the corporate authorities wish to proceed with annexation, they may
then enter into an annexation agreement with the owner of the territory to be
annexed, which agreement is to state the purpose and terms of the annexation.
The annexation agreement shall be executed by the village president and
attested by the village clerk upon the adoption of a resolution or ordinance
directing said execution, which resolution or ordinance must be passed by a
vote of majority of the corporate authorities then holding office.
         (b)   The village board shall adopt an annexation ordinance in
conformity with the annexation agreement and the Illinois municipal code.
   (E)   Applicability Of Terms Of Annexation Agreement: The annexation
agreement shall be binding upon the successor owners of record of the land,
which is then subject of the agreement and upon successor municipal authorities
of the village.
   (F)   Annexation Fees: In order to cover the cost of site plan review,
preparation of annexation plats, examination of same, legal fees, engineering
fees, recording fees, and any other fees related to the annexation, anyone
annexing to the village may be charged a fee to cover the above costs. The fee
to be charged in any annexation may be set by the village board. This fee would
be in addition to any fee as set forth in subsection (B) of this section.
   (G)   Final Plats Of Annexation: Final plats of annexation, once the
annexation agreement is executed and the annexation ordinance is adopted, shall
be submitted to the village clerk and it shall be recorded by the village, and
the original plat, once recorded, shall be returned to the village clerk.
   (H)   Records Of Annexations: A record of all requests for annexation,
including village action taken, shall be kept on file in the office of the
village clerk and copies shall be available on request, to any person for a fee
specified in the fee schedule, which shall be kept on file in the office of the
village clerk. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-2-21: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   (A)   Enforcement: This title shall be enforced by the superintendent of
buildings, or his/her designee. The superintendent may secure the assistance of
the village attorney to seek an injunction, abatement, other appropriate
actions to enjoin, abate or stop any violation of this title and, at times, the
aid of the police department may be sought to enforce this title. The property
owner charged with the violation may be held responsible for any legal expenses
incurred by the village.
   (B)   Penalties: Any person, firm or corporation who violates, disobeys,
omits, neglects or refuses to comply with, or who resists the enforcement of
any of the provisions of this title, upon conviction, shall be fined for each
offense. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense for the purposes of the penalties and remedies available to the
village. The accumulation of penalties for violations, but not the obligation
for payment for violations already committed, shall cease upon correction of
the violation.
   (C)   Fines: Fines for violation of this title shall be in accordance with
subsection 1-4-1(A) of this code. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)

CHAPTER 3
NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION:
11-3-1: Purpose
11-3-2: General Standards Of Applicability
11-3-3: Nonconforming Uses Of Land, Buildings Or Structures
11-3-4: Nonconforming Buildings And Structures
11-3-5: Nonconforming Lots Of Record
11-3-6: Nonconforming Signs
11-3-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations and limitations on the
continued existence of uses, buildings, platted lots or structures established
prior to the effective date hereof that do not conform to the provisions of
this title. Many such nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this
chapter are designed to curtail substantial investment in such nonconformities
and, where appropriate, to bring about their eventual elimination in order to
preserve the integrity of the zoning districts and regulations established by
this title. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-3-2: GENERAL STANDARDS OF APPLICABILITY:
   (A)   Authority To Continue: Any nonconforming buildings, structures,
platted lots, and uses that existed lawfully at the time of adoption of this
title, and which remain nonconforming, and any such building, structure,
platted lot or use that has become nonconforming upon adoption of this title,
or of any subsequent amendments thereto, may continue subject to the provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   Illegal Uses, Buildings And Structures: Uses, buildings and structures
that were not lawfully established prior to adoption of this title, and remain
unlawful after the effective date hereof, shall not become legal by virtue of
its enactment.
   (C)   Burden On Property Owner To Establish Legality: The burden of
establishing the legality of a nonconformity that is existing under the
provisions of this title shall, in all cases, be upon the property owner of the
nonconforming use, building or structure, and not upon the village. Illegal
uses, buildings and structures shall be immediately brought into compliance
with all ordinances of the village.
   (D)   Safety Regulations: All police power regulations enacted to promote
the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare including,
but not limited to, all building, fire and health codes, shall apply to
nonconforming buildings and structures. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-
2007)
11-3-3: NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND, BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES:
This category of nonconformities consists of uses of land, buildings or
structures that are used for purposes on the effective date hereof, or any
amendment thereto, not permitted in the zoning district in which they are
located. Such uses may be continued as follows:
   (A)   Expansion Of Use Prohibited: A nonconforming use of land, buildings or
structures shall not be expanded, extended, enlarged or increased in intensity.
Such prohibited activity shall include, without limitation:
      1.   Any extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the
normal hours of operation on the effective date hereof.
      2.   Expansion of any building or structure devoted entirely to a
nonconforming use.
      3.   An expansion or extension of a use, or its accessory uses, to any
structure, building, or land area, other than that occupied by such
nonconforming use, on the effective date hereof.
      4.   An expansion or extension of such use, including its accessory uses,
within a building or other structure, to any portion of the floor area that was
not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date hereof.
   (B)   Relocation Of Use: A nonconforming use of land, buildings or
structures shall not be relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location
on the same lot or parcel, or to any other lot or parcel, unless the use
thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located after being so relocated.
   (C)   Change In Use: A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use
other than a use permitted within the zoning district in which the use is
located. When such a nonconforming use has been changed, in whole or in part,
to a permitted use, the whole or part which has been made to conform may not
thereafter be changed back to a use that is not permitted.
   (D)   Discontinuation Or Abandonment Of Use: Whenever a nonconforming use of
a building or premises has been discontinued for a period of six (6)
consecutive months, or thirty (30) consecutive days if a special use is
required, or changed to a higher classification or to a conforming use, such
nonconforming use shall not thereafter be changed back to a use that is not
permitted.
   (E)   Ordinary Repair And Maintenance: Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls,
nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on any
nonconforming building or structure. No repairs or reconstruction shall be made
that would create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of any previously
existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building in any manner.
   (F)   Damage And Destruction:
      1.   In the event that any building or structure and/or property, that is
devoted, in whole or in part, to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed,
by any means not within the control of the property owner or tenant, to the
extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its replacement value at that time,
then the building, structure and/or property shall not be restored or rebuilt
unless the building or structure thereafter conforms to all regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located.
      2.   The replacement value of the building, structure and/or property
shall be based on: a) a sale of that building, structure and/or property within
the previous year; b) an appraisal within the last two (2) years; or c) the
amount for which building, structure or property was insured prior to the date
of the damage or destruction. When such building, structure and/or property is
damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the property owner
or tenant, to the extent of less than fifty percent (50%) of the replacement
value at that time, it may be repaired, reconstructed or restored, provided
that no new nonconformities are created and that the existing degree of
nonconformity is not increased. A building permit shall be obtained for such
rebuilding, restoration, repair or reconstruction within one year of the date
of damage or destruction, and the construction shall be substantially completed
within one year of issuance of the building permit.
      3.   In the event that the permit is not obtained within one year or that
repairs or restoration are not substantially completed within one year of the
issuance of the building permit, then the building, structure and/or use of
property shall not be restored unless the building, structure and/or property,
and the use thereof, conforms to all regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located. In the event that any building, structure and/or property
is damaged or destroyed by means within the control of the property owner or
tenant, the building, structure and/or property and use thereof, as restored or
repaired, shall comply with all requirements of this title. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-
2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-3-4: NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES:
This category of nonconformities consists of buildings and structures that are
existing on the effective date hereof, or any amendment thereto, for which the
size or location does not conform with the yard, height, or other dimensional
or bulk provisions of this title, or any amendment thereto. Such buildings or
structures shall only be continued as follows:
   (A)   Additions And Enlargements: A building or structure which is
nonconforming with respect to its bulk, shall not be added to or enlarged.
   (B)   Structural Alterations: No structural alterations shall be performed
on any nonconforming building or structure, except in the following situations:
      1.   When the alteration is required by law or is necessary to restore
the building or structure to a safe condition upon the order of any official
charged with protecting the public safety.
      2.   When the alteration will result in eliminating the nonconformity.
      3.   When the alteration will not create any new nonconformity, increase
the degree of any existing nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building
or structure in any manner.
      4.   The building or property is restored or replaced pursuant to
subsection 11-3-3(F) of this chapter.
   (C)   Relocation: A nonconforming building or structure shall not be
relocated, in whole or in part, to any other location on the same lot or
parcel, or to any other lot or parcel, unless the building or structure thereof
shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it
is located after being so relocated.
   (D)   Ordinary Repair And Maintenance: Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls,
nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on any
building or structure that is devoted, in whole or in part, to a nonconforming
use, provided it will not create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of
nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building or structure in any manner.
(Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-3-5: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
This section regulates lots of record, existing on the effective date hereof,
which do not conform with the lot area or lot width requirements for the
district in which they are located. No nonconforming lot of record may be
improved except in compliance with this section.
   (A)   Individual Lots Of Record In Residential Districts: In the residential
districts, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
title, a single-family dwelling and its accessory buildings may be erected on a
single nonconforming lot of record, provided that the lot is in separate
ownership and it meets all other zoning district bulk requirements.
   (B)   Lots Of Record Held In Common Ownership: If, on the effective date
hereof, in situations where there are two (2) or more lots of record with
continuous frontage in single ownership and one or more of the lots having
contiguous frontage does not meet the requirements for lot width or lot area as
established by this title, the land so involved shall be considered to be a
single undivided parcel for the purposes of this title. No portion of said
parcel shall be used, which does not meet the lot width and lot area
requirements established by this title. No division of the parcel shall be made
which leaves remaining lot(s) with lot width or lot area below the requirements
as stated in this title. No building permit shall be issued for the use of any
lot or portion of a lot transferred or conveyed in violation of this section.
   (C)   Additional Criteria For Nonconforming Lots Of Record: A variation from
this section may be obtained to permit the separation of two (2) adjoining lots
held in common ownership, provided that the village board finds that the
applicant complies with the standards for a variation in section 11-2-17,
"Variations", of this title. In addition, the applicant must comply with one of
the following standards:
      1.   Both lots meet the lot area and lot width requirements in effect at
the time the applicant purchased the lots.
      2.   Over half of the lots within five hundred feet (500') of the subject
lots have been developed as individual building sites and do not comply with
either the lot width or lot area requirement for the zoning district in which
they are located.
      3.   The owners of the abutting lots refuse to sell or convey, at a fair
market price, portions of their lots that could be added to the subject lots to
render them conforming without rendering said abutting lots or structures
located on such lots nonconforming. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-3-6: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
The provisions for nonconforming signs are contained within section 11-14-14,

owner fails this request, the village board shall issue a final determination
of abandonment for the site.
Upon written notice by the village to the owner of a determination of
abandonment, the owner shall have sixty (60) days to dismantle and remove the
tower and accompanying buildings and structures, and restore the property to a
condition approved by the superintendent of buildings.
         (b)   If the owner fails to remove the tower and facility and restore
the property, the tower owner will forfeit the bond as discussed in subsection
(Q)3(k) of this section, and the village will remove the tower and facilities
and restore existing land, but will not remove the part belowground. (Ord.

intent nor the effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution
of obscene material. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)

11-11-4: ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
All uses shall comply with the performance standards established in this
section unless any federal, state, county or village law, ordinance or
regulation establishes a more restrictive standard, in which event the more
restrictive standard shall apply.
   (A)   Noise: No activity or use shall be conducted in a manner that
generates a level of sound as measured on another property greater than that
allowed by noise regulations of the state pollution control board, as amended
from time to time. The limits shall not apply to construction noises, noises
emanating from safety signals or warning devices, noises not directly under the
control of the owner or occupant of the property, and transient noises from
moving sources, such as railroads and aircraft.
   (B)   Glare And Heat: Any activity, or operation of any use, producing glare
or heat shall be conducted so that no glare or heat from the activities or
operations shall be detectable at any point off the lot on which the use is
located. Flickering or intense sources of light shall be controlled or shielded
so as not to cause a nuisance across lot lines.
   (C)   Vibration: No earth borne vibration from any operation of any use
shall be detectable at any point off the lot on which the use is located.
   (D)   Dust And Air Pollution:
      1.   Dust and other types of air pollution, borne by the wind from
sources, such as storage areas, yards, roads, conveying equipment and the like,
within lot boundaries, shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping,
screening, sheltering, paving, fencing, wetting, collecting or other acceptable
means. No persons shall cause, or allow, the emission of fugitive particulate
matter across lot lines visible to an observer looking generally toward the
zenith, beyond the property line.
      2.   This requirement shall not apply when the wind speed is greater than
twenty five (25) miles per hour. Determination of wind speed for the purposes
of this rule shall be by a one hour average or hourly recorded value at the
nearest official station of the U.S. weather bureau or by wind speed
instruments operated on the site.
   (E)   Discharge And Disposal Of Radioactive And Hazardous Waste: The
discharge of fluid and the disposal of solid radioactive and hazardous waste
materials shall comply with applicable village, state and federal laws and
regulations governing such materials or waste. No operation that produces
radioactive or hazardous waste material shall commence without prior notice to
the village. Notice shall be given at least three (3) weeks before the
operation is commenced. Radioactive and hazardous material waste shall be
transported, stored and used in conformance with all applicable federal, state
and village laws.
   (F)   Electromagnetic Interference: Electromagnetic interference from any
operation of any use in any district shall not adversely affect the operation
of any equipment located off the lot on which such interference originates and
is subject to state and federal regulations.
   (G)   Odors: The release of materials intrinsically odorous, or capable of
being odorous, by either bacterial decomposition or chemical reaction, which
renders it perceptible from beyond the lot and constitutes a public nuisance,
shall be prohibited.
   (H)   Toxic Substances: The storage, handling or transport of toxic
substances shall comply with the laws of the state of Illinois and all federal
laws and all state and federal regulations.
   (I)   Water Pollution: All uses shall comply with the state of Illinois
pollution control board rules and regulations, 35 Illinois administrative code,
subtitle C, "water pollution", as well as all applicable federal laws and
regulations.
   (J)   Fire And Explosion Hazards: Materials that present potential fire and
explosion hazards shall be transported, stored and used only in conformance
with all applicable federal, state and local laws. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff.

11-12-12: Off Street Parking Requirements; Table 12-2
11-12-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
Off street parking is permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts,
provided that it complies with the requirements of this chapter. Off street
parking as a principal use is permitted only when expressly authorized by the
regulations of the applicable zoning district.
   (A)   No Reduction Of Required Spaces: Any off street parking or loading
space required in connection with buildings or structures existing on the
effective date hereof shall not be removed, except in conformance with the
requirements of this title. Any building or structure that is erected or
substantially altered after the effective date hereof shall provide off street
parking and loading spaces in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Provision Of Additional Spaces: Nothing in this title shall be deemed
to prevent the voluntary establishment of off street parking or loading
facilities, provided that such facilities meet the requirements of this title
governing the location, design and operation of such facilities.
   (C)   Limitations On Use Of Parking And Loading Spaces: No motor vehicle
repair work of any kind shall be permitted in any parking space, parking lot or
loading berth. The repair or maintenance of motor vehicles conducted as a
business or commercial activity is prohibited in off street parking facilities
located in a residential district.
   (D)   Change In Land Use: Whenever the existing use of a building or
structure shall hereafter be changed to a new type of use, parking and loading
facilities shall be provided as required for such new type of use. For those
buildings and structures erected prior to the effective date hereof, additional
parking and loading facilities shall be provided only in the amount by which
the requirements for the new type of use exceed the requirement for the
existing type of use.
   (E)   Change In Intensity Of Use: When a building or structure shall undergo
any increase in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating
capacity or other unit of measurement, parking and loading facilities shall be
provided for such increase in intensity. If, however, additional parking or
loading facilities cannot be added, in whole or in part, due to a lack of
available land area, a property owner may request a variation from this
provision. The village board shall consider each variation request as it
relates to the standards established in section 11-2-17, "Variations", of this
title.
   (F)   Buildings Erected Prior To Effective Date Hereof: This chapter shall
not be construed to require the addition of any parking or loading spaces for
uses in buildings or structures existing on the effective date hereof. When a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date hereof and
construction has begun within one year, and has been diligently pursued,
parking and loading facilities shall be provided in the amount required for the
issuance of the permit, regardless of any amount required by this chapter.
   (G)   Site Plan Review And Building Permit For Paving, Driveways, Parking
Areas And Sidewalks: Any application for a building permit or occupancy permit
for a new or enlarged building, structure or use shall include a site plan,
drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any off street parking or loading
facilities to be provided. In accordance with section 11-2-14, "Site Plan
Review", of this title, the site plan review committee shall review the plan
for compliance with this chapter and this title. A building permit shall be
required prior to installation of any paved parking areas, driveways or
sidewalks on private property in all districts. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff.
10-15-2007)
11-12-2: COMPUTATION:
   (A)   Basis For Computation: The total number of required parking and
loading spaces shall be based upon the requirements for the principal use of
the lot. However, when more than one use occupies the same lot, the number of
required spaces shall be the sum of the separate requirements for each use. All
off street parking facilities shall be completed before occupancy of the
building or structure for which it serves. When the determination of the number
of parking spaces is based on the number of employees, the owner or manager
shall be counted as an employee.
   (B)   Fractional Spaces: When determination of the number of required off
street parking or loading spaces results in a requirement of a fractional
space, any fraction of one-half (1/2) or less may be dropped, while a fraction
in excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one parking space.
   (C)   Bench Seating: In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators
occupy benches, pews or similar seating facilities, each twenty two inches
(22") of such seating facility shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of
determining the requirement for off street parking facilities under this title.
(Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-12-3: DESIGN AND SIZE:
   (A)   Dimensions: A required off street parking space shall be at least nine
feet (9') in width and at least twenty feet (20') in length, which includes
space for vehicle bumper overhang, exclusive of access drives, aisles, ramps
and columns. Such space shall have vertical clearance of at least seven feet
(7'). The dimensions of parking spaces, aisles and/or driveways are set forth
in figure 12-1 below:

*Two-way traffic authorized.
   (B)   Surfacing And Striping: Any and all open parking areas and driveways
shall be surfaced with bituminous, asphalt, concrete, or a like material, with
adequate drainage provided. Striping of the surface to define each parking
space shall be provided and shall be visible at all times.
   (C)   Bumper Stops: Bumper stops, curbing or wheel checks shall be provided
to prevent any vehicle from damaging or encroaching upon any adjacent parking
or loading space, sidewalk, landscaped area, fence, wall or building.
   (D)   Access: Each off street space shall open directly upon an aisle or
driveway of such width as will provide adequate means of vehicular access to
such parking space. All off street parking facilities shall be provided with
appropriate means of vehicular access in a manner that least interferes with
traffic movement and allows the driver of the vehicle to proceed forward into
street or alley traffic rather than back out. All required off street parking
facilities shall have vehicular access from a street, alley, driveway or cross
access connection, consisting of all weather, hard surfaced pavement. Access to
a public street shall not exceed twenty five feet (25') in width.
   (E)   Drainage: Adequate drainage shall be provided. Surface drainage across
a public sidewalk is not permitted where village storm sewers are available.
Adequate maintenance of surface and drainage is the responsibility of the
owner.
   (F)   Screening: All open parking areas containing more than three (3)
parking spaces shall be screened in accordance with chapter 13, "Landscaping
And Screening", of this title.
   (G)   Lighting: Parking lot lighting shall be in accordance with subsection
11-11-2(D), "Exterior Lighting", of this title. All parking lot lighting shall
be shielded and directed downward at all times so as not to project or reflect
rays of light onto adjacent properties and so as not to create a traffic hazard
on adjacent streets.
   (H)   Slope: Except for parking spaces accessory to a single-family detached
dwelling, no area of any parking facility shall have a slope of more than five
percent (5%). No access ramp shall have a slope of more than eight percent
(8%).
   (I)   Maintenance: Except in the manufacturing district, no cleaning or
maintenance of parking lots utilizing motorized equipment may be performed
between eleven thirty o'clock (11:30) P.M. and six o'clock (6:00) A.M. each
day, except for the removal of snow. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-12-4: LOCATION OF SPACES:
   (A)   Yards: Off street parking spaces may be provided in surface lots,
below grade, beneath a building and, in those zoning districts where
specifically allowed, in parking structures. Parking is permitted in required
and nonrequired yards, provided the required screening and landscaping is
provided. No parking is allowed in the front yard of any use in the B-
2 district.
   (B)   Off Site Spaces: Parking spaces required for single-family or two-
family dwelling units shall be located on the same lot as the dwelling served.
Parking spaces required for all other uses shall be located on the same lot as
the use served. In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other
than the zoning lot on which the use is located, the applicant shall be
required to provide written documentation in the form of a letter of agreement
from the property owner that controls the land where parking is proposed to be
used. The letter shall, to the satisfaction of the superintendent of buildings,
ensure that the parking will serve the proposed use. Parking may be provided on
land other than the lot on which the use is located. Such facilities shall be
located within three hundred feet (300') of the closest property line for the
use(s) served.
   (C)   On Street Parking: In the B-2 district, on street parking spaces
located within one hundred fifty feet (150') of the front or side property line
of the site may be counted toward the required off street parking spaces.
   (D)   Parking Garages Or Structures: Parking garages or structures that
enclose all parking spaces may occupy eighty percent (80%) of the entire lot
area of a site to provide area for landscaping the frontage and corner side
frontage. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-12-5: SHARED PARKING:
   (A)   Standards: Off street parking and loading facilities for separate uses
may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not
less than the sum of the separate requirements of each such use, and if all
regulations governing the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to
the use served are observed. However, no parking or loading space, or portion
thereof, shall serve as the required space for more than one use, unless
otherwise authorized in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Procedures:
      1.   The zoning board of appeals may authorize a reduction in the total
number of required parking or loading spaces for two (2) or more uses jointly
providing off street parking when their respective hours of operation do not
substantially overlap. The petitioner shall provide sufficient data to indicate
that there is not a substantial conflict in the principal hours of operation of
the uses.
      2.   The petitioner shall submit a legal agreement guaranteeing that the
parking spaces or loading spaces shall be maintained so long as the uses are in
existence unless the required parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with
this chapter. The instrument shall be approved by the village attorney and
shall be recorded with the county recorder of deeds. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007,
eff. 10-15-2007)
11-12-6: ACCESSIBLE PARKING:
   (A)   Required Spaces: In all off street parking facilities, except for
single-family detached or attached dwellings, parking spaces for disabled
persons shall be provided. The number of accessible parking spaces shall be
included in the total number of required parking spaces and shall be in
accordance with the applicable requirements of Illinois statutes and the
Illinois administrative code, as amended from time to time.
   (B)   Dimensions And Design: Such spaces shall comply with the design
standards presented in the state of Illinois accessibility standards, provided
that in no instance shall the width of any one space be less than sixteen feet
(16'). Such spaces shall be identified by a sign and by pavement markings
indicating parking for the disabled only. Such spaces shall be the spaces
closest to the entrance of the building or structure and shall be connected by
a paved surface designed to provide safe and easy access. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-
2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-12-7: PARKING FACILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION:
It is the intent of the village to accommodate all modes of transportation,
including bicycles, motorcycles and scooters. Therefore, it is required that,

convenience and general welfare of the village by fostering an aesthetically
pleasing development. The regulations are intended to increase the
compatibility of adjacent uses, and minimize the adverse impact of noise, dust,
motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions, and other
objectionable activities or impacts conducted on, or created by, adjoining or
neighboring uses. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-2: LANDSCAPE PLAN:
   (A)   Landscape Plan Required: A detailed landscape plan shall be submitted
to the village and approved prior to the issuance of building permits.
   (B)   Content Of Landscape Plan:
      1.   The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures,
property lines, easements, parking lots and drives, roadways and rights of way,
sidewalks, ground signs, refuse disposal and recycling areas, sidewalks,
bicycle paths and parking facilities, fences, electrical equipment,
recreational facilities, drainage facilities, and other freestanding
structures, as determined necessary by the superintendent of buildings.
      2.   The location, quantity, size and name, both botanical and common, of
all existing plant materials, including trees and other material in the right
of way, and indicating plant material to be retained and removed.
      3.   The location, quantity, size and name, both botanical and common, of
all proposed plant material including, but not limited to, shade trees, shrubs,
ground cover, annuals/perennials and turf.
      4.   The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours at
two foot (2') intervals. Proposed berming shall be indicated using one foot
(1') contour intervals.
      5.   Elevations of all fences and retaining walls proposed for location
on the site.
      6.   Elevations, cross sections and other details, as determined
necessary by the superintendent of buildings. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-
15-2007)
11-13-3: SELECTION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT MATERIALS:
   (A)   Selection: All planting materials used shall be of good quality and of
a species capable to withstand the climate extremes of northeastern Illinois,
as well as the individual site microclimates. Size and density of plant
material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria
that shall be considered when selecting plant material. The use of drought
tolerant and salt tolerant plant material is preferred.
   (B)   Installation: All plant materials shall be free of disease and shall
be installed in a fashion that ensures the availability of sufficient soil and
water to sustain healthy growth. For new construction in residential districts,
front and corner side yard lawn areas shall be planted with sod and interior
side and rear yards may be seeded prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
   (C)   Maintenance:
      1.   All landscaping materials shall be maintained in good condition to
present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance. Landscaped areas shall be kept
free of refuse and debris. Plant material not in this condition shall be
replaced when necessary. Fences and barriers shall be maintained in good
repair. The owner of the premises shall be responsible for the maintenance,
repair and replacement of all landscape materials, fences, barriers and refuse
disposal areas. Irrigation systems, if needed, shall be maintained in good
operating condition to promote the health of the plant material and the
conservation of water.
      2.   The owner of the premises and any leasee shall be jointly and
severally responsible for the maintenance, repair and replacement of all
landscape materials, fences and barriers. Irrigations, where required, shall be
maintained in good operating condition to promote the health of the plant
material. Violation of this chapter shall be subject to the enforcement
provisions of section 11-2-21, "Enforcement And Penalties", of this title.
(Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-4: DESIGN CRITERIA:
Landscape plans described above shall be prepared, evaluated and approved based
on the following design criteria:
   (A)   Scale And Nature Of Landscaping Material: The scale and nature of
landscaping materials shall be appropriate to the size of the structures. Large
scale buildings, for example, should generally be complemented by large scale
plants.
   (B)   Selection Of Plant Material: Plant material shall be selected for its
form, texture, color, pattern of growth and suitability to local conditions.
   (C)   Shade Trees: All shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size of two
and one-half inches (21/2") in caliper, unless otherwise specified.
   (D)   Evergreen Trees: Evergreens trees shall have a minimum height of six
feet (6') when year round screening and buffering is required.
   (E)   Shrubs: All deciduous and evergreen shrubs shall have minimum height
of twenty four inches (24") at planting, unless otherwise specified.
   (F)   Softening Of Walls And Fences: Plant material should be placed
intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences and other
barriers to create a softening effect.
   (G)   Planting Beds: Planting beds should be mulched with bark chips,
feather rocks or similar materials. Mulch or lava stones used in landscaping
shall be subordinate to and not a substitute for plant material. When used, the
material must be compatible and appropriate.
   (H)   Detention/Retention Basins And Ponds: Detention/retention basins and
ponds shall be landscaped. Such landscaping should include shade and ornamental
trees, evergreens, shrubbery, hedges, turf, ground cover and/or other plant
materials. Where appropriate, wetland plants may be utilized for these areas.
   (I)   Irrigation: Landscape design pursuant to the requirements of this
chapter must recognize the need for irrigation and water conservation.
Sprinkler irrigation systems may be required for certain landscape areas,
however, all irrigation systems shall be designed to minimize the use of water.
   (J)   Domestic Turf Grasses: Domestic turf grasses should be used in areas
with little or no slope to prevent the runoff of irrigation water.
   (K)   Energy Conservation: Plant material placement should be designed to
reduce the energy consumption needs of the development.
      1.   Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west sides of
buildings to provide shade from the summer sun.
      2.   Evergreens and other plant materials should be concentrated on the
north and west sides of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
   (L)   Preservation Of Existing Plant Material: Existing plant material
should be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site. Effort should be
made to preserve and protect existing trees with trunk diameters in excess of
twelve inches (12"). Construction equipment and personnel should be kept away
from such trees and their root systems by the installation of fencing at the
drip line of trees.
   (M)   Berming: Earthen berms and existing topographic features should be
incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site where there is sufficient
space and particularly when combined with plant material to facilitate
screening. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-5: MINIMUM LANDSCAPING OF YARDS:
   (A)   Turf Required: All yards within the village shall be landscaped
primarily with turf or other acceptable plant materials. Paving of yards is
prohibited unless approved by the superintendent of buildings.
   (B)   Required Trees: Shade trees (a minimum trunk size of 21/2 inches in
caliper) shall be provided for all yards on multiple- family residential and
nonresidential lots at a rate of one tree for every two thousand five hundred
(2,500) square feet of yard. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-6: PARKWAY LANDSCAPING:
The following requirements shall apply to the ground areas within the public

11-13-7: PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING:
All parking lots designed for ten (10) or more parking spaces shall provide
landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Parking lots
designed for three (3) to nine (9) cars shall only be subject to the parking
lot screening requirements from adjacent residential properties. Motor vehicle
sales and leasing establishments with outdoor display are not subject to these
requirements.
For existing parking lots that currently do not contain the required parking
lot landscaping, the required landscaping shall be provided when the parking
lot is expanded or when a building addition or exterior remodeling of a
building is proposed, unless waived by the zoning board of appeals. Resealing
of and repairs to an existing parking lot that do not entail paving or
resurfacing by replacement of the asphalt or concrete shall not be subject to
this requirement.
   (A)   Interior Parking Lot Landscaping:
      1.   Parking Lot Island Required: In rows of parking spaces, one parking
lot island shall be provided for every eight (8) parking spaces. Double rows of
parking shall provide islands that extend the entire width of the double row.
      2.   Landscaped Areas: The landscaped areas defined above shall be
improved as follows:
         (a)   Location: Interior parking lot landscaped areas (planting
islands at least 6 inches above the surface of the parking lot and protected
with concrete curbing) shall be dispersed throughout the parking lot in a
design and configuration that aesthetically corresponds to the size and shape
of the parking lot. Generally, islands should be located at the ends of rows
and evenly dispersed in the interior of rows of parking.
         (b)   Size: Interior parking lot landscaped areas shall be a minimum
of one hundred twenty (120) square feet in area and shall be a minimum of eight
feet (8') in width, as measured from back of curb to back of curb.
         (c)   Type Of Landscape Material: The primary plant materials used in
parking lots shall be a tree species approved by the superintendent of public
works. Shrubbery, hedges and other plant materials may be used to supplement
the tree plantings, but shall not be the sole contribution to such landscaping.
         (d)   Quantity Of Landscape Material: A minimum of one shade tree
shall be provided for every one hundred twenty (120) square feet of interior
parking lot landscaped area.
         (e)   Ground Cover: A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of every parking
lot island shall be planted with an approved ground cover in the appropriate
density to achieve complete cover within two (2) years.
   (B)   Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping: Perimeter parking lot landscaping
is to provide for the enhancement and screening of parking lots by requiring a
uniform scheme of landscaping along public streets and between uses.
      1.   Applicability: Perimeter landscaping is required for parking lots
with ten (10) or more spaces, and shall be established along the corresponding
edge of the parking lot in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
      2.   Landscape Area: Where perimeter landscaping is required, it shall be
at least ten feet (10') in width, as measured from the back of curb, and
excluding any parking space overhang area.
      3.   Required Improvements: The following landscape improvements shall be
provided within the perimeter landscape area:
         (a)   Trees: One tree for every forty feet (40') of yard length. Trees
may be clustered based on specific site requirements.
         (b)   Shrubs: One shrub, measuring a minimum of twenty four inches
(24") in height at planting and not to exceed four feet (4') in height at
maturity, for every three feet (3') of yard length, clustered or spaced
linearly as approved by the village. The landscape treatment shall run the full
length of the yard when abutting a residential use or the public right of way,
and fifty percent (50%) of the yard when abutting a nonresidential use. The
number of shrubs may be reduced or combined with a berm or low pedestrian wall,
the height of which provides effective screening to a maximum height of four
feet (4').
         (c)   Ground Cover: Landscaped areas outside of shrub and tree masses
shall be planted in turf or other live ground cover.
      4.   Site Size: Where site size is a constraint, the superintendent of
public works may approve alternate location for plantings and/or waive
requirements. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-8: LANDSCAPE BUFFERS BETWEEN USES:
The regulations of this section shall establish the dimensions and improvement
requirements of landscape buffers as required for transitions between uses.
Landscape buffers shall be reserved for the planting of material and
installation of fencing, as required within this section. No parking,
driveways, sidewalks, accessory buildings or other impervious surfaces shall be
permitted within the buffer area. Landscape buffers may be located within
required yards. Where both landscape buffers and parking lot landscaping is
required, the more restrictive shall apply. The village shall have the
discretion to require additional landscape material, where necessary, to
minimize adverse impacts to adjacent property and maximize screening.
In some instances, a buffer may not be required. These include, but are not
limited to, instances where: a) the rear wall of a commercial building is
located on the rear property line; b) where an alley is located between a
commercial property that abuts a residential property; or c) where a
residential property abuts a residential property and the buffer requirements,
as written, would mandate two (2) fences. Where it proves excessively difficult
to meet the landscape buffer requirements of this section and this title, the
site plan review committee may approve alternative approaches, but may not
waive requirements. A complete waiver of buffer requirements is subject to the
discretion of the village board upon recommendation of the zoning board of
appeals.
The minimum size and improvement of landscape buffers for various situations
shall be as follows:
   (A)   R-3, R-4, R-5 And B-1 District: Where an R-3, R-4, R-5 or B-1 district
abuts an R-1 or R-2 district, a landscape buffer a minimum of five feet (5') in
width, a solid opaque masonry fence or wall six feet (6') in height, a berm
and/or combination thereof shall be provided unless an alley separates the
districts. Within the required landscape buffer, the following improvements
shall be provided:
      1.   Shade trees, a minimum of two and one-half inches (21/2") in
caliper, shall be planted on an average of one tree for every thirty feet (30')
of the yard length.
      2.   A solid opaque masonry fence or wall six feet (6') in height shall
be erected along one hundred percent (100%) of the yard length.
      3.   Areas not planted with trees shall be maintained as turf or other
ground cover. If required by the village, this buffer shall be supplemented
with shrubs.
   (B)   B-2, B-3, Or O/I District: Where a lot in the B-2, B-3 or O/I district
directly abuts any residential district, except in areas where the districts
are separated by an alley, a row of parking with a landscape buffer a minimum
of eight feet (8') in width shall be provided. The exception is that in the B-
2 district, the buffer requirement may be reduced when the site lacks
sufficient space to provide the full buffer, as determined by the site plan
review committee if a permitted use, and village board if a special use or
planned unit development. Within the required landscape buffer, one, or a
combination of the following improvements shall be provided:
      1.   A mix of shade trees, a minimum of two and one-half inches (21/2")
in caliper, and evergreen trees, a minimum of eight feet (8') in height, shall
be planted on an average of one (1) tree for every twenty feet (20') of the
yard length.
      2.   A solid opaque masonry fence or wall six feet (6') to eight feet
(8') in height shall be erected along one hundred percent (100%) of the yard
length. A berm, planted with the above required plant material may be
substituted for the screen fence or wall, where approved by the village.
      3.   Areas not planted with trees shall be maintained as turf or other
ground cover. If required by the village, this buffer shall be supplemented
with shrubs.
   (C)   Nonresidential Uses In Residence Districts: Where a nonresidential use
within a residential district directly abuts a residential property, a
landscaped yard a minimum of five feet (5') in width shall be provided. The
buffer and/or screening requirement may also be waived where the zoning board
of appeals determines that screening along a property line that abuts an alley
may create a hazardous condition or poor visibility. Within the landscape
buffer required, the following improvements shall be provided:
      1.   Shade trees, a minimum of two and one-half inches (21/2") in
caliper, shall be planted on an average of one tree for every thirty feet (30')
of the yard length.
      2.   A solid opaque screen fence or wall six feet (6') to eight feet (8')
in height shall be erected along one hundred percent (100%) of the yard length.
      3.   Areas not planted with trees shall be maintained as turf or other
ground cover. If required by the village, this buffer shall be supplemented
with shrubs. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-9: SCREENING OF REFUSE DISPOSAL DUMPSTERS:
Refuse disposal dumpsters in all zoning districts shall not be visible from
roadway rights of way. If visible from roadway rights of way, such dumpsters
shall be screened on three (3) sides by a solid wood fence or masonry wall to a
height of not less than six feet (6') but no more than eight feet (8'). Slatted
chainlink fences are prohibited. Where required, the dumpster enclosure shall
be gated, and situated on a concrete apron that extends a minimum of six feet
(6') beyond the opening of the enclosure so as to support the weight of the
waste disposal vehicle during unloading. Refuse shall not be permitted to
accumulate such that it is visible above the height of the enclosure. (Ord.
1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-10: SCREENING OF LOADING BERTHS:
Loading berths in all zoning districts shall be screened as much as possible
while still allowing access to the use it is serving, unless such screening is
determined unnecessary by the site plan review committee for a permitted use,
or village board for a special use or planned unit development. Such screening
shall consist of a solid wood fence or masonry screen wall to a height of not
less than six feet (6') or a continuous evergreen or dense deciduous shrub
hedge, or a combination of the two (2). Slatted chainlink fences are
prohibited. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-11: SCREENING OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES AND OUTDOOR STORAGE:
   (A)   All business, operations or processing, except for off street parking
and off street loading, shall be conducted within completely enclosed
buildings. All storage within twenty five feet (25') of a residential district
boundary, except of motor vehicles in operable condition, shall be within
completely enclosed buildings.
   (B)   All outdoor storage areas adjacent to a residential or business
district shall be screened therefrom by a wall, fence or continuous evergreen
or dense deciduous shrub hedge a minimum of six feet (6') in height. In
addition, outdoor storage areas shall be screened by a wall, fence or dense
hedge six feet (6') in height from the public right of way. Slatted chainlink
fences are prohibited. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-13-12: CHANGES TO APPROVED LANDSCAPE PLANS:
Any change to an approved landscape plan shall only be authorized by the
superintendent of public works, provided the alternative plan meets the intent
of this title. Landscape improvements made to a lot that are not in conformance
with an approved landscape plan shall be a violation of this title. The
superintendent of public works shall recommend landscape plans that do not
fully comply with this chapter, only upon hardship shown by applicant, to the
village board, which must approve such landscape plan. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007,

11-15-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of planned unit development is to encourage the most orderly
development of properties through advanced planning and thus to:
   (A)   Assure adequate standards for the development of residential
neighborhoods.
   (B)   Establish a pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation,
endangered species, topographic and geologic features.
   (C)   Provide regulations to encourage a variety of dwelling types.
   (D)   Assure adequate open space, recreation areas and public facilities.
   (E)   Protect residential areas from the intrusion of business, industrial
and other land uses that may create an adverse effect upon the living
environment.
   (F)   Promote the general welfare of the community. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007,
eff. 10-15-2007)
11-15-2: DESCRIPTION; EXEMPTION:
   (A)   A planned unit development (PUD) may be described as the subdivision,
development and use of land, containing four (4) or more acres, developed as an
integral unit and combining more than one primary land use, which may provide
for single-family or multi-family residential, educational, business,
commercial, industrial, recreational, park and common use areas. However, in
the B-2 village center district, a planned unit development may be twenty
thousand (20,000) square feet or more so long as it complies with the
requirements of subsection 11-15-3(C) of this chapter and this chapter.
   (B)   The planned unit development may be exempt from the provisions of the
subdivision regulations and this title to the extent specified in the final
authorization of the planned unit development by the village board. (Ord. 1650,
10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)
11-15-3: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
No planned unit development shall be authorized unless the zoning board of
appeals and village board shall find, in addition to those standards
established herein for special uses, that the following standards are met:
   (A)   General Standards:
      1.   The uses permitted by such exceptions, as may be requested or
recommended, are necessary or desirable and appropriate to the purpose of the
development.
      2.   The uses permitted in such development are not of such a nature, or
so located, as to exercise an undue detrimental influence or effect upon the
surrounding neighborhood.
      3.   That any park areas established in the planned unit development
conform to all requirements as set forth in this title.
      4.   That all minimum requirements pertaining to commercial, residential,
institutional or other uses established in the planned unit development shall
be subject to the requirements for each individual classification as
established elsewhere in this title, except as may be specially varied in the
ordinance granting and establishing a planned unit development.
      5.   When private streets and common driveways are made a part of the
planned unit development, or private common open space or recreation facilities
are provided, the applicant shall submit, as part of the application, the
method and arrangement whereby these private facilities shall be guaranteed to
be operated and maintained. Such arrangements for operating and maintaining
private facilities shall be subject to the approval of the village board.
   (B)   Residential Planned Unit Development Standards:
      1.   Residential density for a planned unit development shall not be
greater than the allowable density as provided in this title, nor shall any lot
used for residential purposes be less in area or dimension than that required
by the district regulations applicable to the district in which the planned
unit development is located, except that the zoning board of appeals may
recommend, and the village board may grant, a reduction in such lot and
dimension, but not more than ten percent (10%) when the planned unit
development provides common open space equal to not less than twenty percent
(20%) of the gross area of the planned unit development.
      2.   Business uses may be included as part of a residential planned unit
development when the zoning board of appeals and village board find that such
business uses are beneficial to the overall planned unit development and will
not be injurious to adjacent or neighboring properties. Such business uses
shall not be greater in area than ten percent (10%) of the residential planned
unit development.
      3.   The open areas provided in the part of the planned unit development
containing only residential structures shall be preserved over the life of the
planned unit development for use only by the residents of the planned unit
development, and the developer shall permanently establish guarantees for the
maintenance of such common areas.
      4.   For that part of a planned unit development devoted to residential
uses, the zoning board of appeals may recommend, and the village board may
approve, access to a dwelling by a driveway or pedestrian walk easement, and
spacing between buildings of lesser widths or depths than required by district
regulations for the district in which the planned unit development is located,
provided:
         (a)   That adequate provisions are made, which perpetuate during the
period of the special use, for access easements and off street parking spaces
for use by the residents of the dwellings served.
         (b)   The spacing between buildings shall be approved by the zoning
board of appeals and village board, and shall be consistent with the
application of recognized site planning principles for securing a unified
development and due consideration is given to the openness normally afforded by
intervening streets and alleys.
         (c)   The yards for principal buildings along the peripheral of the
development shall not be less in width or depth than required for permitted
uses in the district regulations applicable to the district in which the
planned unit development is located, and adequate screening and buffering, is
provided with landscape protection to neighboring properties, as recommended by
the zoning board of appeals and approved by the village board.
   (C)   B-2 Village Center Planned Unit Development:
      1.   B-2 village center district planned unit developments shall include
clearly identifiable communitywide benefit improvements to the village.
Benefits may include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   Provision of streetscape amenities such as street furniture and
landscaping in addition to that required by this title.
         (b)   Creation of a community open space.
         (c)   Utilization of transit oriented development design principles.
         (d)   Expansion of village infrastructure that can serve other parts
of the community.
      2.   A planned unit development in the B-2 village center district is
permitted to exceed the height limits of the district up to seven (7) stories,
subject to the approval of the village board and zoning board of appeals.
      3.   The village board may grant a density bonus for a planned unit
development in the B-2 village center district. The total number of bonus units
shall be determined on a case by case basis, based on the merits of the plan;
however, the density bonus may not exceed more than twenty five percent (25%).
The village board and zoning board of appeals shall grant the bonus based on
its review of the proposed planned unit development, and finding that the
proposed development offers a superior layout and quality design based on
design and environmental amenities which are demonstrated to exceed established
development standards.
      4.   If more intensive uses are permitted than are allowed by the
district regulations, there must be clear evidence that such uses are desirable
and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development. The
uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature, or so located, as to
exercise a detrimental influence on the development nor on the surrounding
neighborhood.
      5.   The amount of off street parking must be adequate to serve the needs
of the project. If determined that the planned unit development warrants
deviation from the parking requirements of this title, the village board and
the zoning board of appeals may require more or less off street parking than is
otherwise required.
      6.   Planned unit developments that front on any major collector or
arterial roadway shall provide landscaped open space between each building and
parking lot in accordance with the requirements of this title. Said landscaped
area shall include combinations of trees, shrubs and seasonal plantings. The
appropriate land area and exact plant material specifications shall be reviewed
and approved by the village board and zoning board of appeals as part of the
planned unit development review and approval process.
      7.   Business uses may be included as part of a village center planned
unit development when the zoning board of appeals and village board find that
such business uses are beneficial to the overall planned unit development and
will not be injurious to adjacent or neighboring properties. Such business uses
shall not be greater in area than twenty five percent (25%) of the village
center planned unit development. (Ord. 1650, 10-10-2007, eff. 10-15-2007)

shall recommend approval if it is in substantial compliance with the
preliminary development plan. The zoning board of appeals shall certify to the
village board that the final development plan is in conformance with the
previously filed preliminary development plan.
         (b)   If the final plan is substantially changed from the approved
preliminary plan, the zoning board of appeals shall recommend to the village
board that a new public hearing be held in conformance with the procedures for
approval of a preliminary plan.
         (c)   After receipt of the recommendation of the zoning board of
appeals, the village board shall review the final development plan and shall,
if it is in conformity with the preliminary development plan, authorize the
special use. If the final development plan is held not to be in conformity with
the preliminary development plan, the village board shall inform the applicant
with regard to specific areas found not to be in compliance.
      2.   After the approval of the final development plan, the use of the
land and the construction, modification or alteration of any buildings or
structures within the planned unit development will be governed by the approved
final development plan rather than by any other provisions of this title. (Ord.

regulations. (Ord. 1136, 6-24-1987)
12-1-5: PRELIMINARY PLAT:
Prior to the completion of the final survey of streets and lots of any
subdivision and before any map of the subdivision is made in form suitable for
recording, a preliminary plat, prepared in accordance with the regulations set
forth herein, shall be submitted to the plan commission for its review and
recommendations. In the event a proposed subdivision is one acre or less in
area, the subdivider shall have the right to dispense with preparation of the
preliminary plat and to proceed directly with submission of the final plat. In
such case, the fee of subsection (F) of this section shall be payable upon
submission of the final plat.
   (A)   Submission Of Preliminary Plat: An application in writing in sextuplet
(6 copies) for the conditional approval of the subdivision, together with ten
(10) prints of the preliminary plat shall be filed with the plan commission at
least ten (10) days prior to the regular monthly meeting of the commission to
receive action at such meeting. The plan commission may forward copies of the
application with prints to the engineer, the park board and the school boards.
The plan commission shall determine whether the preliminary plat is in proper
form and shall not receive or consider the application as filed until all
documents are in accordance with the requirements set forth herein.
The application is to be accompanied by a statement from the clerk, collector,
ex officio, that the filing fee has been paid as specified in subsection (F) of
this section.
   (B)   Consideration Of Preliminary Plat: The plan commission will study the
preliminary plat in connection with the official comprehensive plan including
the major street plan, the zoning title and the topography of the area, and
will take into consideration the general requirements of the community, the
particular requirements of the neighborhood, and the best use of the land to be
subdivided. Particular attention will be given to specific requirements for
parks, playgrounds, school sites, major streets, the adequacy of street
connections and the suitability of the land for development. The preliminary
plat may also be subject to check by the engineer, the park board and school
boards.
   (C)   Action On Preliminary Plat: The plan commission will communicate its
conditional approval or its disapproval, in writing to the subdivider within
sixty (60) days of the time at which application for conditional approval is
made, giving, in cases of conditional approval:
      1.   The specific changes which will be required in the preliminary plat.
      2.   The character and extent of the required public improvements.
      3.   The nature and extent of the percentage surety which it will require
to guarantee completion of the improvements.
   (D)   Conditional Approval Of Preliminary Layout: Conditional approval by
the plan commission of the preliminary layout does not constitute acceptance of
the plat of the proposed subdivision, acceptance of proposed improvements or
final agreement as to improvement specifications or cost. It is to be
considered only as approval of general layout design.
   (E)   Effective Period Of Conditional Approval: Conditional approval of the
preliminary plat shall be effective for a maximum period of twelve (12) months
except that submission within this period of a final plat applying to a portion
of the area covered by the preliminary plat shall extend the effective period
of conditional approval to a maximum of twenty four (24) months from the date
of submission of the preliminary plat. If a final plat has not been submitted
to the plan commission within these time limits, the preliminary plat shall
again be submitted to the plan commission for conditional approval.
   (F)   Fees:
      1.   Conditions: In order to cover the costs of examining the plat,
advertising and holding public hearings, legal fees, copying fees, tax search
fees, recording fees and other expenses incidental to the approval of the
subdivision and recording of same, the subdivider shall pay a fee at the time
of application for conditional approval of the preliminary plat. There will be
no refund of any portion of the fee if the subdivider fails to apply for final
approval of the subdivision. If, because of the failure of the subdivider to
submit a final plat within twelve (12) months after receiving conditional
approval of a preliminary plat, it is necessary to resubmit a preliminary plat
for conditional approval, the subdivider shall be required to pay the fee
currently in effect at the time of resubmission. (Ord. 1136, 6-24-1987)
      2.   Amount: The fees for submission of a subdivision shall be five
hundred dollars ($500.00), plus one hundred dollars ($100.00) per dwelling
unit, existing and proposed. If the subdivision is not approved by the village
board, no refund will be given. (Ord. 1540, 6-12-2002)
      3.   Place Of Payment: Fees shall be paid to the clerk, collector, ex
officio, at the village hall.
      4.   Use: All fees collected for the submission and approval of
subdivisions shall be credited to the general fund of the village.
      5.   Separate Charge: All fees established by this section are in
addition to any sums paid to cover costs of preparation of improvement plan and
field inspection of construction as required under the provisions of section
12-1-7 of this chapter. (Ord. 1136, 6-24-1987)
12-1-6: SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAT:
After approval of the preliminary layout by the plan commission and fulfillment
of the required conditions, the subdivider shall apply in writing to the
chairman of the plan commission for approval of a final plat. The final plat
shall conform substantially to the preliminary layout as given conditional
approval. The application shall be in duplicate and shall be accompanied by the
original inked plat on material approved by Cook County records office and ten
(10) prints. Specifications for the plat and for other documents to accompany
the application are given in section 12-1-8 of this chapter. The final plat
will not be considered as submitted unless it is in agreement with
specification and accompanied by the required documents.
   (A)   Hearing: The chairman of the plan commission will notify the
subdivider or his representative of the time and place at which he will be
heard publicly on behalf of his application.
   (B)   Action On Final Plat: The plan commission will communicate in writing
to the subdivider its disapproval or recommendation for approval of the final
plat, together with the reasons therefor within sixty (60) days after the date
on which application for such approval is made. If the plan commission approved
the final plat, such approval will be entered upon the tracings by signature of
the chairman. The tracings shall then be transmitted to the village board by
the plan commission with recommendation for its approval. Upon approval by
village board action the tracings shall be signed by the president. Approval by
the village board may be by resolution setting forth all conditions upon which
approval is predicated. The original tracing shall be recorded with the Cook
County recorder of deeds after all signatures and seals are affixed.
Appropriate notifications shall be given the plan commission and the subdivider
advising village board approval or disapproval and advising document numbers
after recording. If the plat is disapproved, the tracings are to be returned to
the plan commission with statement of reasons. A copy of the reasons for
disapproval may be filed in the office of the village clerk and the applicant
may be notified of this action in writing.
   (C)   Approval Not Acceptance Of Improvements: Approval of the final plat
shall not be deemed to constitute or effect any acceptance by the village of
any improvement shown on the plat.
   (D)   Effectiveness Of Final Approval: Approval of the final plat by the
plan commission and the board shall be null and void if the plat is not
acceptable for recording in the office of the recorder of deeds of Cook County.
   (E)   Documents: Attendant documents accompanying the final plat are to be
forwarded to the board with the tracings and are to be filed by the clerk.
(Ord. 1136, 6-24-1987)
12-1-7: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   (A)   General Principles Of Acceptability:
      1.   Conformance To Official Comprehensive Plan: The subdivision shall
conform to the official comprehensive plan or the portions thereof then
existing, and shall not encroach upon areas designated in the official
comprehensive plan for future public facilities.
      2.   Provision For Future Subdivision: If a tract is subdivided into
larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to
allow the opening of future streets and logical further subdivision.
      3.   Reserve Strips Prohibited: There shall be no reservation of strips
of land that prevent or limit access to land dedicated or intended to be
dedicated to public use.
      4.   Buffer Strips: Where a residential subdivision adjoins a railroad
right of way, an industrial area, a business area, a major street or other land
use which would have a depreciating effect on the residential use of the
property, a buffer strip ten feet (10') in width, to form a screen, may be
required by the village.
      5.   Building Sites: Every lot must contain a suitable building site.
      6.   Trees: Valuable large trees shall be preserved whenever possible.
Where planting strips are provided with trees, trees or shrubs within a forty
foot (40') radius from intersecting property lines at a street intersection
shall not have branches closer than eight feet (8') to the ground over
sidewalks and fifteen feet (15') over roadways. The subdivider shall provide
two (2) trees per lot, spaced uniformly in the right of way, of uniform size no
less than two and one-half inches (21/2") in diameter, and of species approved
by the superintendent of public works.
These trees shall not be planted directly over water mains, sanitary sewer
lines, or underground gas or electric lines. The village also recommends that
the following trees not be allowed for planting in parkways: elms, willows,
poplars, box elders, soft maples, ornamental trees (crab trees, flowering
shrubs, fruit trees), and upright evergreens.
      7.   Neighborhood Plan: If a suggested plan for the neighborhood or area
in which the tract to be subdivided is located has been made by the village,
the street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformance thereto.
      8.   Variations: Variations from the design and dimensional standards and
improvement requirements of these regulations may be made by the village in
cases where, owing to exceptional conditions, there are extreme difficulties or
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of these regulations.
Resubdivision of a single lot of a platted block of an old subdivision shall be
considered as an exceptional condition meriting departure from the strict
letter of these regulations. No variation shall be made that will be
detrimental to the public welfare or that will affect adversely the official
comprehensive plan.
   (B)   Streets; Layout And Design:
      1.   Major Streets: Whenever a subdivision embraces a major street, as
shown on the major street plan, such major street shall be platted in the
location and of the width indicated on the major street plan.
      2.   Secondary Streets: Secondary streets shall be included when it is
apparent that sufficient traffic will flow from the minor streets within the
subdivision and that such traffic will need to be channeled to control the
number of access points to the major street. There is a requirement of a sixty
six foot (66') right of way.
      3.   Street Layout: The street layout shall be devised for the most
advantageous development of the entire neighborhood area. Where necessary to
the neighborhood pattern, existing principal streets in adjoining subdivisions
shall be continued and shall be at least as wide as the existing streets and in
alignment with them. The street layout shall provide for the future extension
of the principal streets into unsubdivided lands adjoining.
      4.   Minor Streets: Minor streets shall be so laid out so that their use
by through traffic will be discouraged. There is also a sixty six foot (66')
right of way requirement.
      5.   Intersections: There shall be a minimum number of intersections of
minor streets with major streets.
      6.   Marginal Access Streets: Where a subdivision has frontage on a major
street, as shown on the major street plan, or on a super highway or other high
volume trafficway and where it is not feasible to have the lots back to such
high volume streets, provision shall be made for marginal access streets. These
marginal access streets shall be approximately parallel to and on each side of
the major street right of way and separated from such right of way by a strip
of land at least forty feet (40') wide. Separation strips may be provided with
screen planting, but such planting shall be so placed that it does not obstruct
vision at intersections.
      7.   Streets For Uses Adjacent To Railroads Or Major Streets: Where a
subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way or major street, the
village may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such
right of way or major street, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of
the intervening land. The distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.
      8.   Streets At Business Centers: In front of areas zoned or designed for
commercial use, the street width and the roadway width shall be increased on
the side on which the property for commercial use is located by a merging lane
at least fifteen feet (15') wide. This is to ensure the free flow of traffic
without interference by vehicles entering or leaving parking areas. This is not
a parking space requirement and shall in no way affect or diminish requirements
by the zoning title or otherwise for off street parking facilities; neither
shall fulfillment of this requirement and its acceptance by the village be
deemed approval or endorsement of any change in zoning necessary for such
commercial use.
      9.   Alleys: Paved rear alleys not less than twenty feet (20') wide will
be required in all business and industrial districts of subdivisions, except
where special conditions make alleys impracticable; in such cases adequate off
street loading space, suitably surfaced, shall be provided. Dead end alleys
shall be avoided, or, if provided, shall include a turnaround. In general,
alleys will not be approved for residential districts of a subdivision, except
where topographic or other conditions may necessitate their use.
      10.   Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited, except where
essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with
the other requirements of these regulations; and where the village president
and the board of trustees finds it will be practicable to require the
dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided.
Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half
of the street shall be placed within such tract. No strip or area shall be
reserved along any portion of a street, or alley which will prevent adjacent
property owners access thereto except by consent of the village board.
      11.   Street Grades: Street grades shall conform in general to the
terrain and shall be not less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) nor more than
five percent (5%). Street grades shall be such as to provide natural surface
drainage of stormwater regardless of the presence or absence of storm sewers.
The intent is to avoid depressions or inverts that will flood in flash storms
for which storm sewers are inadequate.
      12.   Cul-De-Sacs: Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed five hundred feet (500')
in length including turnaround and shall have a turnaround not less than one
hundred twenty five feet (125') in diameter of right of way and pavement
diameter of one hundred feet (100') back of curb to back of curb at the closed
end.
      13.   Right Of Way Widths: The minimum right of way widths for streets,
alleys and crosswalkways shall be as provided in title 1, chapter 15 of this
code.
      14.   Roadway Widths: Roadway widths shall be as provided for in title 1,
chapter 15 of this code.
      15.   Curvature Of Streets: The minimum radius of curvature of streets on
the centerline shall be:
 
Major street     600 feet
Secondary street 300 feet
Minor street     100 feet
Cul-de-sac       100 feet
 
      16.   Reversed Curves: Between reversed curves on major and secondary
streets there shall be a tangent at least one hundred feet (100') long.
      17.   Intersections: Street intersections shall be at right angles or
nearly so. Where, because of topographic or other reasons an intersection
cannot be at right angles, such intersection shall be so designed as to ensure
safety. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty
five feet (125') shall be prohibited.
      18.   Curb Radii: Curb radii shall not be less than twenty feet (20').
Where an angle of intersection less than sixty degrees (60°) is permitted, curb
radii shall be increased as necessary for safety.
      19.   Street Names: No street names may be used which will duplicate or
be confused with the names of existing streets in the Midlothian postal
district. Existing street names must be projected wherever possible. Street
names shall be subject to the approval of the village board.
      20.   Access To State Highways: If the tract of land proposed to be
subdivided or any part thereof lies adjacent to a highway over which the
department of transportation of the state of Illinois has jurisdiction with
respect to maintenance and upkeep thereof, and an entrance or entrances are
desired from such highway to lots, streets, roadways, or alleys in such
proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall submit prior to subdivision approval
to the village a written permit from the said department of transportation,
granting his permission to obtain and construct such an entrance or entrances.
   (C)   Blocks:
      1.   Lengths Of Blocks: Blocks shall not exceed one thousand five hundred
feet (1,500') in length; blocks longer than eight hundred feet (800') in length
may be required to have crosswalkways. Crosswalk easements not less than ten
feet (10') in width shall be provided where deemed necessary by the plan
commission at the approximate centers of the blocks. The use of additional
crosswalkways in any instance to provide safe and convenient access to schools,
parks, or other similar destinations may be recommended by the plan commission.
      2.   Blocks For Industrial Or Commercial Use: Blocks intended for
industrial or commercial use shall be designed specifically for such purpose,
with adequate space set aside for off street parking and loading.
      3.   Blocks On Major Streets: It is preferred that blocks adjacent to
major streets be so arranged that the long dimension of the block be parallel
to the major street and that lots do not front on or have access to the major
street. Where this arrangement is not feasible, marginal access streets may be
required.
   (D)   Lots:
      1.   Minimum Width And Area: Lots for residential use shall be at least
sixty feet (60') wide at the building setback line and shall be at least eight
thousand one hundred (8,100) square feet in area. Septic systems are not
allowed if sewers are reasonably accessible. Residential lots, served by septic
systems shall be a minimum of one hundred feet (100') wide at the building line
and shall have a minimum area and depth as determined by specifications for
seepage systems recommended by the county department of public health; provided
further; that no such lot shall have an area less than twenty thousand (20,000)
square feet.
         (a)   Lots for residential use in a subdivision of two (2) acres or
less may be at least fifty feet (50') wide at the building setback line and
shall be at least six thousand two hundred fifty (6,250) square feet in area
when after review of the plan commission the village board feels that a new
subdivision is in an area composed of lots of compatible lot size and the
village board approves said subdivision.
         (b)   A subdivision of two (2) acres or less will not be approved for
fifty foot (50') lots if the owner and/or subdivider has made the subdivision
two (2) acres or less by dividing, selling or subdividing a larger parcel of
land he has a beneficial interest in or which he owns or has under contract.
      2.   Maximum Depth: The maximum depth of any lot, exclusive of unusable
land shall be three and one-half (31/2) times the width of the lot.
      3.   Lot To Abut On Street: Every lot shall abut on a dedicated and
improved street for at least twenty five feet (25').
      4.   Building Setback Lines: Minimum setback lines from property lines in
residential zone shall conform with the zoning regulations.
      5.   Corner Lots: Corner lots in residential zones shall conform to the
corner side yard and front yard setbacks in the applicable zoning district.
      6.   Property Lines At Corners: Property lines at street intersection
corners shall be arcs having a radii of at least ten feet (10') or shall be
chords of such arcs.
      7.   Side Line Of Lots: Side lines of lots shall be approximately at
right angles or radial to the street line.
      8.   Shape Of Lots: The shape of lots and their orientation shall be
appropriate to the location of the proposed subdivision and to the type of
development contemplated.
      9.   Double Frontage Lots: Double frontage lots, other than corner lots,
will be permitted only under unusual circumstances.
   (E)   Public Places:
      1.   Parks And Playgrounds: Not less than seven percent (7%) of the area
of every subdivision, exclusive of streets, alleys and unusable land shall be
set aside for public recreational, school or other public purposes, other than
of streets and alleys, unless the village shall find that the proposed
subdivision is adequately served by such facilities. In small subdivisions,
such reservation of land shall be so located as to permit combining it with
similar reservations in adjoining tracts. Reservations of land for park and
recreational use shall be located to conform as nearly as possible, with the
parks section of the official plan. Whenever a final plat of subdivision, or
part thereof, has been approved by the corporate authorities as complying with
the official map and there is designated therein a school site, park site, or
other public land, the corporate authorities having jurisdiction of such use,
be it school board, park board or other authority, such authority shall acquire
the land so designated by purchase or commence proceedings to acquire such land
by condemnation within one year from the date of approval of such plat; and if
it does not do so within such period of one year, the land so designated may
then be used by the owners thereof in any other manner consistent with this
chapter including the official map and the zoning title.
      2.   Natural And Cultural Features: Outstanding natural and cultural
features, such as scenic spots and watercourses shall be preserved insofar as
possible.
      3.   Easements:
         (a)   Regulations: All aboveground utilities shall be placed on rear
or side property lines. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, an
appropriate easement shall be provided for the watercourse in either an open
cut or in an underground conduit, depending upon the density of development.
Where water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, gas mains, telephone lines,
power lines or other utilities are located on or adjacent to property lines,
adequate easements together with right of ingress or egress thereto and
therefrom shall be provided and platted. Easements shall not be less than ten
feet (10') in width and shall be centered upon the centerline of the utility.
Where more than one utility is to occupy the easement, the easement shall be of
such width as to extend five feet (5') at each side beyond the centerlines of
the outermost utilities. Additional width shall be provided where necessary to
accommodate utility pole bracing. The village may require evidence of approval
by the public utility company of easement width. Where side lot easements occur
adjacent to a driveway, there shall not be less than ten feet (10') clearance
between the easement line and the extreme projection of the building structure.
(Ord. 1136, 6-24-1987)
         (b)   Drainage Easements: Drainage easements are deemed to be for the
mutual benefit of the lands connected or protected by said drainage easement
and shall constitute a perpetual easement on such lands and shall not be
filled, extracted, breached or impaired in any way without the written consent
of the owners of such lands benefited. Their consent must provide that they
have read and agree with the engineering report referred to below. Lands
benefited shall be determined by a qualified engineering report paid for by the
landowner who wishes to do any work in an easement area. The engineering report
must show why the drainage easement is not needed or to what extent it can be
reduced. It must show what property is currently affected by the drainage
easement and what property would be affected by any change in the drainage
easement. A detailed plan must be provided for any work required in the
drainage easement area. The village engineer will review the report and plan at
the landowner's expense and must give his approval before a permit will be
issued by the village or before any work can be done or change made to the
easement area.
         (c)   Utility Easements: Utility easements shall have no structure or
building (except a division fence) placed upon it unless the owner of the land
obtains written permission from all the utilities who have a right to use said
easement. The written permission must describe the land, the easement, their
right to use the easement and what type of an encroachment structure or
building they would allow and where it would be allowed on the easement area.
         (d)   Proof Of Compliance: Any improvement or structure requiring a
village permit will require that the applicant provide satisfactory proof of
compliance with this subsection (E)3 before any application or a variation will
be considered. (Ord. 1441, 6-24-1998)
   (F)   Monuments And Markers:
      1.   Monuments shall be of concrete with a diameter of not less than six
inches (6") and thirty six inches (36") long, cast in place, with a copper
dowel three-eighths inch (3/8") in diameter, at least two and one-half inches
(21/2") in length imbedded so that the top of the dowel shall be not more than
one-fourth inch (1/4") above the surface and at the center of the monument.
      2.   Monuments shall be set so that the top is level with the established
grade adjoining it and placed so that the marked point on the metal center
shall coincide exactly with the intersection of street property lines, the
intersection of all angles in the boundary line and at the beginning and ending
of all curves along streets on the inside street lines.
      3.   Lot corners not marked by concrete monuments as required herein,
shall be marked by galvanized or wrought iron pipe, or iron or steel bars at
least three feet (3') in length and not less than five-eighths inch (5/8") in
diameter, the top of the pipe or bar to be set level with the established grade
of the ground adjoining it.
   (G)   Improvements:
      1.   Working Drawings And Specifications Required: Before considering the
approval of the final plat for any subdivision, the village will require that
complete working drawings and specifications be submitted for those
improvements requested at the time of conditional approval of the preliminary
layout. Improvements required may include one or more of the items listed in
subsection (G)5 of this section.
      2.   Source Of Drawings And Specifications: The subdivider shall have the
option of having working drawings and specifications for improvements prepared
by a registered professional engineer, retained by the subdivider or of having
such drawings and specifications prepared by the village.
Under either option, all working drawings, specifications and cost estimates
shall be checked by the engineer or by a consulting firm duly retained by the
village. The subdivider shall reimburse the village for preparation and for
checking of working drawings, specifications and cost estimates in accordance
with subsection (G)16 of this section. Working drawings and specifications
shall be in strict accordance with village standards and requirements and shall
be subject to approval by the village engineer.
      3.   Permission Required: Specific permission of the board shall be
secured before commencement of construction of any improvement. Approval of the
final plat by the board shall constitute permission to proceed with
construction, provided the plat is accepted for recording by the county
recorder. If the subdivider elects, as provided in subsection (G)14 of this
section, to construct an improvement prior to approval of the final plat, the
board may extend permission to proceed upon recommendation of the plan
commission together with certification by the engineer that working drawings
and specifications have been prepared and that engineering fees have been paid
and that suitable inspection bonds have been posted.
      4.   Other Permission: The subdivider shall also secure any permission
required by law of the state and county officials and permission extended by
the village shall not relieve the subdivider of responsibility to secure state
and county approval.
      5.   Types Of Improvements: The village shall have the power to require
one or more of the following improvements depending upon the nature and scope
of the subdivision. Particular attention shall be given to means for
disposition of stormwater and to the desirability of curb and gutter or other
provision to prevent breakdown of pavement edges. The design, layout and
carrying capacities of stormwater, sanitary sewer, and water facilities shall
recognize the future requirements of adjacent undeveloped areas.
         (a)   Street and alley grading and surfacing.
         (b)   Grading and surfacing of off street parking space.
         (c)   Curb and gutter.
         (d)   Sidewalks.
         (e)   Crosswalks.
         (f)   Sanitary sewage facilities.
         (g)   Water mains and hydrant.
         (h)   Stormwater drainage facilities.
         (i)   Street signs.
         (j)   Streetlights.
         (k)   Driveways.
         (l)   Street trees.
         (m)   Seeding or sodding.
         (n)   Compacted fill.
         (o)   Topsoil where appropriate.
         (p)   Retention ponds.
      6.   Village Standards: All improvements shall be in accordance with
village standards and requirements and regulations in effect at the time of
submission of the final plat. Maintenance of retention ponds shall be the
responsibility of the owner and subdivider and they must provide proof of a
plan to provide proper maintenance. They may not deed the property to others
unless the grantee has a plan of maintenance approved by the village.
      7.   Qualification Of Contractors: The developer shall make available to
the engineer and superintendent of public works a list of all contractors and
subcontractors who are to participate in construction of public improvements.
Such contractors and subcontractors shall be subject to the licensing
provisions of this code and shall be subject to disqualification by reason of
faulty performance upon past construction work done.
      8.   Inspection Required: All improvements shall be subject to inspection
by a duly authorized and qualified village inspector both during the course of
construction and after construction is complete. The inspector shall have
authority over materials of construction, methods of construction and
workmanship to ensure compliance with working drawings and specifications. The
contractor shall provide for reasonable tests and proof of quality of materials
as requested by the inspector, and upon due cause shall include weather
conditions, questionable materials of construction, workmanship or nonadherence
to specifications and drawings.
      9.   Inspection Reports: The inspector may be required to prepare and to
submit to the superintendent of public works each day a report stating progress
of work and giving his findings as to quality and quantity of materials used
and quality of methods and workmanship. He shall in particular call attention
to any circumstances that entail departures from working drawings and
specifications such as unforeseen difficulties of drainage, groundwater, poor
subsoil, unstable fill material, unconventional or faulty practices of
contractors or other circumstances. Whenever, in his opinion, such departures
are likely to cause either a lower ultimate standard of performance or a higher
construction cost than could reasonably be anticipated, he shall immediately
notify the engineer. When an improvement has been completed he shall prepare a
summary report.
      10.   Subdivider Responsible: Approval by the inspector or absence of
inspection shall in no way relieve the subdivider of full responsibility for
adherence by his contractors to specifications and working drawings nor for
high standards of materials, methods and workmanship.
      11.   Approval Not Acceptance: Approval by the inspector shall not be
deemed acceptance of the improvement by the village. Acceptance shall be only
by action of the board and acceptance shall be contingent upon a favorable
inspection report.
      12.   Notification: It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or
his contractor to notify the engineer and superintendent of public works when
work is to be started and to request assignment of an inspector. The initial
notification that a particular improvement is to be started shall be in writing
and shall reach the engineer and superintendent of public works seven (7) days
in advance of the date that inspection is to begin. The notice shall be
accompanied by an inspection bond in accordance with subsection (G)16 of this
section.
      13.   Responsibility For Maintenance: As further assurance of serviceable
construction and to provide for repair of damage resulting from subsequent
construction operations of the subdivider or his contractors, the subdivider
shall be responsible for all maintenance of an improvement for a period of not
less than fifteen (15) months following completion of construction of that
improvement; providing, in addition, that the subdivider shall be responsible
for all maintenance of roadways, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, parkway strips
and extension boxes and hydrants of water facilities until all construction
work has been completed upon other improvements, and fill adjacent to the
improvements under consideration. The guarantee of completion and maintenance
shall recognize the possibility of maintenance costs and the terms of the
guarantee shall provide for reimbursement to the village for any maintenance
expenses incurred by the village in performing maintenance work after failure
of the subdivider to perform such work upon due notice. An improvement shall
not be accepted by the village sooner than fifteen (15) months after completion
of construction nor before all construction work has been completed upon
adjacent improvements, and fill until all maintenance work is complete.
      14.   Guarantee Of Completion And Maintenance: The board shall not
consider approval of the final plat unless and until the subdivider has
guaranteed the completion of all required improvements within a reasonable
period and in compliance with working drawings and specifications and has
guaranteed to maintain the improvements until they are accepted by the board.
This guarantee shall be by one or a combination of one or more of three (3)
methods. Only one method shall be applied to one specific improvement.
         (a)   The subdivider may post a performance bond prepared in a form
approved by the attorney and underwritten by a surety company listed as
approved by the village. The amount of the bond shall be not less than one
hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the final estimate of cost of the
improvement as estimated by the engineer under subsection (G)16 of this
section. There shall be no reduction in the amount of that portion of the bond
applying to a particular improvement unless and until that improvement is
complete and accepted or approved by the board. The subgrade, base course and
surface course of a street, alley, or parking area shall be considered as a
single improvement from the standpoint of acceptance. A subdivider may post a
letter of credit from a bank approved by the village. Said letter of credit
must be in a form approved by the village attorney. The letter of credit would
be accepted upon the same terms as set out above for a performance bond.
         (b)   The subdivider may deposit a cash bond with the village in
accordance with a specific escrow agreement approved by the attorney and board
and in an amount not less than one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the
final estimate of cost of the improvements as estimated by the engineer under
subsection (G)16 of this section. The deposit shall be held in a special
account by the village and the agreement may provide for partial payouts as
work progresses in amounts recommended by the engineer and approved by the
board as corresponding to the original estimate of unit costs. Partial payouts
shall be contingent upon favorable inspection reports and the sum of partial
payouts for a single improvement shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the
original deposit for the improvement until and unless the improvement is
complete and accepted or approved by the village. The subgrade, base course and
surface course of a street, alley or parking area shall be considered a single
improvement from the standpoint of acceptance.
         (c)   Upon specific permission of the board, as recommended by the
engineer, the subdivider may elect to complete one or more improvements prior
to approval of the final plat. Where the subdivider elects to guarantee
completion of an improvement by this method, approval of the final plat shall
be contingent upon certification by the superintendent of public works and
engineer that the improvement has been completed in accordance with drawings
and specifications, that the inspection reports are favorable, and that
guarantee has been provided to cover costs of maintenance of the improvement in
accordance with subsection (G)13 of this section.
      15.   Acceptance: Acceptance of an improvement for the village shall be
only by resolution of the board upon recommendation of the engineer. Acceptance
shall be contingent upon:
         (a)   The fulfillment of the requirements of subsection (G)13 of this
section.
         (b)   An opinion by the attorney that satisfactory and proper
conveyances have been made by the subdivider to the village or to the
appropriate school or park districts.
         (c)   The improvement being complete and in good repair in accordance
with village standards and requirements.
         (d)   Inspection reports indicating compliance with working drawings
and specifications.
         (e)   A single improvement shall not be accepted in part; it shall be
complete throughout the subdivision as indicated in the final plat and working
drawings. The subgrade, base course and surface course of a street, alley or
parking area shall be considered as a single improvement.
         (f)   Acceptance of an improvement shall constitute release of the
applicable portion of the performance bond or of the applicable portion of the
balance of cash deposit.
      16.   Fees: To defray the engineering and inspection expenses incurred by
the village in preparation or checking of preliminary and final cost estimates,
working drawings, specifications, in checking the final plat (prepared by
others), and in executing inspection responsibilities, the subdivider shall be
required to reimburse the village as follows. These are separate and distinct
charges from the fee paid at the time of submission of the preliminary layout.
         (a)   If the subdivider elects to have working drawings and
specifications prepared by the village, he shall make a request for preparation
of a preliminary estimate of construction costs for improvements. This request
shall be in writing to the clerk and shall be accompanied by a certified check
in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to be receipted for the clerk.
This bond is to guarantee the expenses of preparation of the preliminary
estimate by the engineer.
         (b)   When notified of the amount of the preliminary estimate of
construction costs the subdivider shall make a further written request to the
clerk an engineering fee equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the engineer's
quoted charge to the village as based upon the practices recommended in the
"Schedule Of Recommended Fees For Engineering Services", latest edition and
revisions, as published by the Illinois Society of Professional Engineers.
         (c)   Upon payment of the engineering fee, the one hundred dollar
($100.00) bond shall be refunded. The one hundred dollar ($100.00) bond shall
be forfeited if the engineer's fee is not paid within twelve (12) months after
notification of the amount of the preliminary estimate of construction costs
and a new bond shall be posted with a new request for preliminary estimate.
There shall be no refund of the engineering fees if the project is abandoned or
if approval of the final plat is denied. Any revision of working drawings, for
whatever reason, shall be subject to an additional engineering fee, paid in
advance, in an amount quoted by the engineer.
         (d)   If the subdivider elects to have working drawings,
specifications and cost estimates for improvements prepared by an engineer
retained by himself, he shall apply in writing to the clerk making a request
that such drawings, specifications and estimates be checked by the engineer.
The application shall be accompanied by two (2) sets of construction prints,
specifications and estimates. The clerk shall inform the subdivider of the
amount of the charge for this service and the charge shall be based upon the
"Schedule Of Recommended Fees For Engineering Services", latest edition and
revisions, as published by the Illinois Society of Professional Engineers.
Checking shall proceed after the subdivider has paid over this fee to the
clerk. Additional fees shall be paid for rechecking of drawings, specifications
and estimates arising from revisions made by or required of the subdivider.
There shall be no refund of engineering fees if the project is abandoned for
any reason whatsoever.
         (e)   The engineering fee is intended to include preparation or
checking of preliminary and final cost estimates, working drawings,
specifications and staking, but it is not intended to include inspection.
         (f)   Before final approval of any plans for grading or construction
of improvements the subdivider, owner or contractor seeking approval of
improvements shall post with the clerk a cash inspection bond in an amount
agreed upon among the engineer, the superintendent of public works, and
subdivider or contractor as being sufficient to provide for review and
inspection charges at the current per diem rates. From this bond shall be
deducted each day the inspection expense incurred by the village at the rates
set forth below. Any excess of the bond over total inspection charges will be
refunded to the depositor and any overdraft on the bond shall be provided for
immediately by the subdivider or contractor to ensure continuity of inspection
and to prevent stoppage of construction by the superintendent of public works.
         (g)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider, owner, or
contractor to notify the engineer seven (7) days in advance as to dates that
construction work will commence and be completed for purposes of determining
the number of days of inspection charge. In event of dispute, only notification
in writing shall be considered as proof of notice.
         (h)   Per diem inspection rates for review and inspection shall be
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the engineer's quoted charge to the
board as based upon the "Schedule Of Recommended Fees For Engineering
Services", latest edition and revisions, as published by the Illinois Society
of Professional Engineers. If inspection is performed by an inspector on the
village payroll the charge shall be two hundred percent (200%) of the regular
salary paid to the inspector computed to an hourly basis. There shall be not
less than a four (4) hour charge for time spent in any one day. For time spent
outside of the regular working hours of the inspector, the hourly charge shall
be three hundred percent (300%) of the regular salary paid to the inspector
computed to an hourly basis.
   (H)   Protection And Repair Of Existing Improvements: The subdivider, his
contractors and suppliers shall be jointly and severally responsible that
existing improvements and the property of the village are not damaged or
rendered less useful or unsightly by the operations of the subdivider, his
contractors or suppliers. This provision is intended to include damage or
nuisance with respect to the land, improvements or landscaping of the village;
damage to existing streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, parkways by passage
thereover of equipment or trucks or by excavation for the any purpose; the
spillage or tracking of earth, sand or rock onto existing streets, sidewalks,
curbs and gutters or parkways; the washing by stormwater of earth or sand onto
streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters or parkways or into catch basins; damage
to water mains, sanitary sewers, culverts or storm sewers. To reduce or
localize the possibility of damage to streets to be used for access to the
subdivision by equipment and trucks and the subdivider shall be responsible for
enforcement of this instruction upon his contractors and their suppliers. The
subdivider shall make provisions to prevent washing of earth or sand onto
sidewalks, streets, curb and gutter and into catch basins by stormwater. Where
deemed advisable, the board shall have the power to require, either prior to
commencement of construction or after construction is in process, that the
subdivider post a surety to guarantee repair of damages or abatement of
nuisance. Where need for surety becomes apparent after construction is in
process, the board shall have the power to order construction discontinued
until surety becomes apparent after construction is in process. The board shall
have the power to order construction discontinued until surety has been posted.
Expenses incurred by the village in repairing damages, cleaning streets, catch
basins and sewers shall be deducted from the surety.
   (I)   Other Regulations Prevail: None of the provisions of these regulations
pertaining to permission, surety, fees, acceptance and approval shall be
constructed as exempting subdividers, general contractors, sidewalk
contractors, cement contractors, building contractors, plumbing contractors or
plumbers, sewer contractors, drain layers, electrical contractors, electricians
or any other contractor or craftsman from any other provision or regulation of

12-2A-2: ORGANIZATION:
To protect people and property from flooding, development of land must be
managed both in the watershed (where the water comes from) and in the
floodplain (where it accumulates). Therefore, this chapter has three (3)
articles.
   (A)   General And Administrative Procedures: This article includes the
definitions, permit procedures and similar administrative matters that apply to
all development projects
   (B)   Site Development Requirements: Article B of this chapter contains the
land development requirements that manage the runoff of stormwater that leaves
the development site. It includes criteria for the amount of water that can
leave a site and measures that must be taken to improve the quality of the
water.
   (C)   Floodplain Development Requirements: Article C of this chapter
contains requirements for developments that will be located in the floodplain.
It includes criteria to protect the new development, to minimize the impact of
the development on flooding to other properties, and to protect the flood
conveyance channel.
   (D)   Overlapping Requirements:
      1.   Floodplains are part of the watershed. All floodplain developments
must also meet the site development requirements of article B of this chapter,
where applicable.
      2.   The definitions in section 12-2A-3 of this article and the
administrative procedures in sections 12-2A-4, 12-2A-5, and 12-2A-6 of this
article apply to both articles B and C of this chapter.
   (E)   Development: This chapter regulates all "development" as defined in
section 12-2A-3, "Definitions", of this article.
      1.   The regulatory criteria are different for three (3) different sizes
of development: level 1, level 2 and level 3, which are also defined in section
12-2A-3 of this article.
      2.   When the term "development" is used alone, it includes all three (3)
levels. (Ord. 1671, 8-13-2008)
12-2A-3: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The "base flood" is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in section 12-12C-1 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The height in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988(or other datum, where specified of the crest of
the Base Flood. Application of the BFE at any location is as defined in Section
12-2C of this chapter.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP): A measure used to control the adverse impacts
of a stormwater discharge on water quality downstream. BMPs include structural
devices (e.g., grassed swales, filter strips and detention basins) designed to
remove pollutants and reduce runoff volumes and nonstructural measures such as
public information on proper disposal and use of pesticides and herbicides.
BUFFER: An area of natural vegetation adjacent to channels, wetlands, lakes,
ponds or other surface waters to be left open for the purpose of eliminating or
minimizing adverse impacts to such areas.
BUILDING: A building that is principally aboveground and is enclosed by walls
and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured
home, mobile home or a prefabricated building. This term also includes
recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more
than one hundred eighty (180) days, unless fully licensed and ready for highway
use.
BYPASS FLOW: An approach that routes tributary drainage area runoff around and
not through a stormwater control structure.
CLOMR: Conditional letter of map revision.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, culvert, gully, ravine, wash,
or natural or open manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and banks or
shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either perennially
or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel.
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or buildings are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION: A letter providing FEMA's comment on a
proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic or
hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the
modification of the existing floodway, the effective BFEs, or the SFHA.

(640) acres, except for detention that provides a watershed benefit.
      5.   The release rate shall be the total of the following:
         (a)   0.04 cubic feet per second per acre of the total tributary
drainage area (on site and off site) at the elevation created by impoundment of
the on site 2-year storm volume plus the detention volume safety factor; and
         (b)   0.15 cubic feet per second per acre of the total tributary
drainage area (on site and off site) at the elevation created by impoundment of
the on site 100-year storm volume plus the detention volume safety factor; and
         (c)   The required compensatory storage.
         (d)   The release rate and on site detention volume shall be
calculated using the twenty four (24) hour storm event. This release rate
calculation shall be used unless other site conditions warrant further analysis
and modification from this standard or unless watershed specific release rates
have been adopted.
      6.   On stream detention shall provide water quality treatment. One of
the following two (2) methods shall be used:
         (a)   A wet detention facility shall be constructed with a minimum
permanent pool volume equal to the calculated sediment volume accumulated over
a one year period for the entire upstream watershed and an average normal water
depth of at least four feet (4'). The facility shall also have a live storage
volume that meets the standard storage requirements of this section.
         (b)   A separate off line sediment basin shall be used with a volume
appropriate for the tributary drainage area to the sediment basin.
      7.   Impoundment of the stream as part of on stream detention shall not
prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to
upstream areas as part of their life cycle, and shall not cause or contribute
to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat. These fish
species may be present or potentially present.
      8.   Compensatory storage requirements shall be satisfied and shall be in
addition to detention volume requirements.
      9.   No on stream detention shall be allowed in areas designated as an
exceptional functional value wetland. (Ord. 1671, 8-13-2008)

   (G)   Streams And Channels: Where an existing stream or channel is proposed
as part of the conveyance system for the development's increased runoff, the
following requirements shall apply:
      1.   The project shall meet all requirements in sections 12-2B-4 and 12-
2B-5 of this article, and section 12-2C-3 of this chapter on channel and bank

twenty (20) acres or less.
         (b)   One foot (1') above the overflow elevation for tributary areas
greater than twenty (20) acres. (Ord. 1671, 8-13-2008)
12-2B-4: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL:
   (A)   General Principles:
      1.   The requirements of this section shall only affect level 1 and 2
developments.
      2.   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the
site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes,
where high cut and fills may be required, should be avoided and natural
contours should be followed as closely as possible.
      3.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected. Clearing of
natural ground cover and/or trees within a buffer area as defined in section
12-2B-5 of this article should be left undisturbed wherever possible.
      4.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time.
      5.   Prior to site clearing and grading, sediment basins or traps, filter
barriers, diversions and other appropriate control measures shall be installed.
      6.   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and
functional as soon as practical during development. Native vegetation is
preferred for developments near, or adjacent to, high quality natural areas,
wetlands and streams.
      7.   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land
uses shall be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
      8.   All waste generated as a result of site development shall be
properly disposed of and shall be prevented from being carried off the site by
either wind or water.
   (B)   On Site Control Measures: The on site control measures shall be
designed based on the size of the disturbed areas as follows:
      1.   For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers
(including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures) shall be
constructed to control all off site runoff as specified in referenced
handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty five feet
(25') may be used as an alternative where runoff in sheet flow is expected.
      2.   For disturbed areas draining more than one acre but less than five
(5) acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed
at the downslope point of the disturbed area in conjunction with other filter
barriers.
      3.   For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment
basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point
of the disturbed area in conjunction with other filter barriers.
      4.   Sediment basin and trap design shall provide for both detention
storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be for equal volumes
of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention storage. Each shall be sized for
the 2-year, twenty four (24) hour runoff from the site. The release rate shall
be that rate required to achieve a minimum detention time of ten (10) hours.
The outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention
storage.
      5.   The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment
load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with
a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in one year. A
sediment removal schedule is required for construction periods exceeding one
year.
   (C)   Stormwater Conveyance Channels: Stormwater conveyance channels,
ditches, swales, and diversions shall convey a 10-year frequency storm without
erosion. All channels shall be stabilized within forty eight (48) hours,
consistent with the following standards:
      1.   For grades up to four percent (4%), seeding in combination with
mulch or erosion blankets shall be placed along the channel sides with sod or
erosion blanket applied to the bottom.
      2.   For grades of four (4) to eight percent (8%), sod shall be used.
      3.   For grades greater than eight percent (8%), use rock or riprap, or
reduce the grade using drop structures.
   (D)   Channel Protection:
      1.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width
shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing
channels.
      2.   Land disturbance activities in stream channels and construction
vehicle use of channels shall be minimized.
      3.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to
minimize erosion. Temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive
materials such as riprap or gravel.
      4.   The temporary stream crossing shall be completely removed and the
stream restored to its preconstruction condition within forty eight (48) hours
after completion of construction, incorporating appropriate native vegetation.
Also see section 12-2C-3, "Requirements In Floodways", of this chapter.
   (E)   Additional Requirements:
      1.   Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps
or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications.
      2.   If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be
protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through
appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent.
      3.   Each site shall have graveled entrance roads, access drives and
parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being
tracked onto public roadways. Any sediment reaching a public or private road
shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning (not flushing) before the end
of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal area.
   (F)   References Adopted:
      1.   Specifications for erosion control measures shall be in accordance
with the most recent edition of the "Illinois Urban Manual".
      2.   Sediment and erosion control planning shall be in accordance with
"Procedures And Standards For Urban Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In
Illinois" (July 1988, as revised in 1993 and thereafter) by the urban committee
of the association of Illinois soil and water conservation districts (the
"Green Book") chapters 1 through 5.
      3.   Where the requirements of subsections (B) through (E) of this
section, the "Illinois Urban Manual" or the "Green Book" conflict, the more
restrictive requirement shall prevail.
   (G)   Plan Requirements: An erosion and sediment control plan shall include
the following:

following the end of active disturbance or redisturbance. The condition of the
construction site for the winter shut down period shall address proper sediment
and erosion control early in the fall growing season. Stabilization measures
include seeding, mulching, sodding or erosion control blankets.
   (I)   Final Site Stabilization: All temporary control measures shall be
disposed of within thirty (30) days after permanent soil stabilization measures
have been installed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils resulting from
the temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further
erosion and sedimentation. (Ord. 1671, 8-13-2008)
12-2B-5: STREAM AND WETLAND PROTECTION:
   (A)   Buffer Areas Required: Buffer areas shall be required along all
streams, lakes, waterways, channels and wetlands, except for the following:
      1.   Roadside ditches;
      2.   Existing excavated stormwater storage facilities;
      3.   Borrow pits and quarries;
      4.   Leveed waterways; and
      5.   Improvements to existing public roads and utilities.
   (B)   Buffer Area Dimensions:
      1.   Linear buffers shall be designated along both sides of all streams
and natural channels. A minimum buffer of thirty feet (30') on each side of the
channel shall be provided.
      2.   Water body buffers shall encompass all lakes, wetlands and other
nonlinear bodies of water. A minimum buffer of thirty feet (30') on each side
of the channel shall be provided.
      3.   Exceptional functional value wetlands shall have a minimum buffer of

      4.   In areas having state or federal threatened and endangered species
present or for Illinois natural area inventory sites, buffer widths may be
modified to meet the terms and conditions specified during consultation with
the Illinois department of natural resources or United States fish and wildlife
service, pursuant to state and federal laws and regulations.
      5.   The buffer area for all waters of the United States shall extend
from the ordinary high water mark. The buffer area for wetlands shall extend
from the edge of the delineated wetland. A property may contain a buffer area
that originates from the waters of the United States on another property.
      6.   Buffer averaging may be allowed by the superintendent of buildings
and/or village engineer, provided the buffer width is at least half of the
buffer width required by this chapter or the minimum width required by a corps
of engineers permit, whichever is wider.
   (C)   Buffer Requirements:
      1.   Features of the stormwater management system may be within the
buffer area of a development.
      2.   Access through buffer areas shall be provided, when necessary, for
maintenance purposes.
      3.   Preservation of buffer areas shall be provided by deed or plat
restriction.
   (D)   Allowed Uses In Buffer Areas:
      1.   All buffer areas shall be maintained free from development except
for the following uses:
         (a)   Passive recreation, including pedestrian, bicycle or equestrian
trails.
         (b)   Construction and maintenance of utilities and stormwater
facilities.
      2.   Structures and impervious surfaces related to recreational
facilities, such as trails and paths, may occupy a maximum of twenty percent
(20%) of the buffer surface area, provided the runoff from such facilities is
diverted away from the waters of the United States or such runoff is directed
to enter the buffer area as unconcentrated flow. Boat docks, boathouses and
piers shall be allowed and count as a structure when calculating percent of
impervious area.
      3.   Buffer areas hydrologically disturbed by allowing construction or as
part of a revegetation plan shall be revegetated using the "Native Plant Guide
For Streams And Stormwater Facilities In Northeastern Illinois" (NRCS, et al.)
as a minimum standard.
   (E)   Channel Protection:
      1.   If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, the permit
applicant shall demonstrate that:
         (a)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to
restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife
habitat.
         (b)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values.
      2.   A channel modification shall be designed and constructed in a way
which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body
of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:
         (a)   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match
as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section,
slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified,
restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into
channel modification design.
         (b)   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both
the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
         (c)   One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible.
Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of
the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects
of the vegetation.
         (d)   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel.
         (e)   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper
than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or riprap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete,
gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
         (f)   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
         (g)   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity
such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate.
         (h)   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the
modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
         (i)   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
         (j)   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel
enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated
by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as
part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
         (k)   Unless the modification is for a public flood control project,
there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the
floodway as a result of the modification.
         (l)   The provisions of subsections 12-2B-4(D) of this article and 12-
2C-3(E) of this chapter shall also be met.
   (F)   Dumping:
      1.   No person, firm, corporation or governmental agency shall dispose of
or dump grass clippings, brush, fill, trash, debris, or other material that may
obstruct the flow or storage of water in any channel, swale, culvert, storm
sewer, wetland, storage basin or other natural or manmade watercourse or water
body.
      2.   No person, firm, corporation or governmental agency shall dispose of
or dump any petroleum products, chemicals, noxious liquids, animal waste or
other materials that will pollute the water in any channel, swale, culvert,
storm sewer, wetland, storage basin or other natural or manmade watercourse or
water body. (Ord. 1671, 8-13-2008)

located below the FPE are watertight.
      4.   Septic systems and other on site waste disposal systems are
prohibited in the SFHA.
   (C)   Filling And Grading: Whenever a development project proposes to fill
or grade vacant land in order to remove a portion of it from the SFHA or to
change the floodway boundary:
      1.   The top of the resulting filled or graded area shall be at or above
the FPE.
      2.   The superintendent of buildings and/or village engineer shall not

12-2C-4: AREAS WITHOUT REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN DATA:
   (A)   Jurisdiction: This section applies to proposed development,
redevelopment, site modification or building modification in SFHAs, (including
AE, AH, AO and Unnumbered A Zones) where no Floodways have been identified and
no BFEs have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile.
Within these areas, all appropriate requirements of section
12-2C-2 of the article shall apply and no development shall be permitted unless
the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing

the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the BFE.
   (B)   Base Flood Elevations: The BFE for each of the remaining SFHAs
delineated as an A Zone, shall be according to the best existing data available
from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an
engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine BFEs. The
following procedures shall be used to obtain the base flood elevation for a
site:
      1.   If the base flood elevation is needed, then the BFE shall be
determined from an accepted hydraulic model, based on current industry
standards.
      2.   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
an accepted hydrologic model, based on current industry standards, or by
techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States
Geological Survey for estimating peak Flood discharges.
      3.   Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the
analyses shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval. Once approved, it must be
submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey floodplain information repository
for filing.
   (C)   Floodway: Within all riverine floodplains where the floodway has not
been determined, the following standards shall apply:
      1.   The developer shall have a Licensed P.E. state in writing and show
through supporting plans, calculations, and data that the project meets the
engineering requirements of Section 702.3.1 through 702.3.9 for the entire
Floodplain as calculated under the provisions of Section 504.0 of this chapter.
      2.   As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study
performed to determine a Floodway and submit that engineering study to IDNR/OWR
and FEMA for acceptance as a designated floodway.
      3.   Upon acceptance of the Floodway by IDNR/OWR and FEMA, the developer
shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of this chapter.
The Floodway shall be defined according to the definition in Section
12-2A-3.
      4.   A Development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first
obtains an IDNR/OWR permit or a determination has been made that an IDNR/OWR
permit is not required.
   (D)   Level 1 Developments: Proposals for new level 1 developments:
      1.   Shall include base flood elevation data and floodway delineations.
The applicant's engineer shall be responsible for calculating the needed data.
      2.   The applicant's engineer shall submit the data to IDNR/OWR for
review and approval as best available regulatory data and then send it to the
state water survey. (Ord. 1671, 8-13-2008; amd. Ord. 2038, 10-16-2019)
12-2C-5: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinances, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. This chapter
is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was adopted to
meet the national flood insurance program regulations, including the previous
chapter 2 of this title, but is not intended to repeal the resolution which the
village passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program. (Ord.
1671, 8-13-2008)
