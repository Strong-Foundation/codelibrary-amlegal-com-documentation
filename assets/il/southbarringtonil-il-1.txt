entered by default and set a new hearing date, upon a petition filed by the

if the administrative hearing officer determines that the respondent's failure
to appear at the hearing was for good cause, or at any time if the respondent
establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the village did not
provide proper service of process. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to
this subsection, the administrative hearing officer shall have authority to
enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for any debt due
and owing the village as a result of the vacated default judgment. When a
judgment is vacated, the administrative hearing officer shall set a new date

      1.   The eligibility requirements set forth in subsection B above;
      2.   Conformity of the anticipated future use of the disconnected
territory with the Village's Comprehensive Plan 2  and, in particular, with the

general area of the territory proposed for disconnection;
      5.   The trend of development outside of the Village in the general area
of the territory proposed for disconnection;
      6.   The need for the anticipated use in South Barrington;
      7.   The extent to which property values in the Village may be diminished
by the disconnection and anticipated future use of the territory;

public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the residents of the
Village;
      9.   The relative gain to the residents of South Barrington as compared
to any hardship to the property owner(s); and

application. The PC/ZBA shall not recommend the granting of a petition for
disconnection unless it finds that such disconnection and anticipated future
use of the territory is in the public interest and is not solely for the
interest of the petitioner. The PC/ZBA may recommend the imposition of such
conditions and restrictions upon the territory to be disconnected as it may
deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the
Village residents, including, but not limited to, the requirement of
recordation of restrictive covenants regarding future use, density of

recommends denial of a petition for disconnection, or in case of a written
protest against a proposed disconnection signed and acknowledged by the owners
of twenty percent (20%) or more of the property adjacent to the territory
proposed to be disconnected is filed with the Village Clerk, such petition
shall not be granted except by the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all
members of the Board of Trustees.
      3.   In granting a petition for disconnection, the Board of Trustees may
impose such conditions and restrictions upon the territory to be disconnected
as it may deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, morals and
welfare of its residents, including, but not limited to, the requirement of
recordation of restrictive covenants regarding future use, density of
development, required bufferyards and conservation easements.
      4.   Action by the Board of Trustees on a petition for disconnection
shall be by resolution. Such resolution, by its terms, shall not take effect
until and unless all review fees incurred by the Village have been reimbursed
by the petitioner and all conditions to approval (such as recording of
restrictive covenants) have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the Village's
legal counsel.
   L.   Appeal to Circuit Court: Actions against the Village pertaining to the
validity of this Chapter or any part thereof, or any application thereof, shall

1-10-2: Policy And Procedure For Administering Applications For PSEBA Benefits
1-10-3: Policy And Procedure For Hearings For PSEBA Benefits
1-10-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a fair and efficient method of
determining the eligibility of an employee for the benefits enumerated under
the public safety employee benefits act, 820 Illinois Compiled Statutes 320/
1 et seq. ("PSEBA"), through an administrative process including, if necessary,
an administrative hearing. All benefits provided under this chapter will be
consistent with PSEBA. (Ord. 2015-1095, 11-12-2015)
1-10-2: POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR ADMINISTERING APPLICATIONS FOR PSEBA BENEFITS:
   A.   Application For PSEBA Benefits: The village shall maintain a PSEBA
benefit application form which shall be the standard form required for a PSEBA
benefit applicant (hereinafter the "applicant") to request benefits under
PSEBA. The form shall be completed pursuant to the instructions on the
application and delivered to the village president for review and
consideration. The applicant shall provide, along with the application and the
required information therein, any medical records regarding the injury, any
decisions by a governing public safety pension board and supporting
documentation related to such pension board decisions, and any additional
pertinent documentation that the applicant wants to have considered or that is
requested by the village.
The PSEBA benefit application form must be signed, sworn and notarized to
certify the truthfulness of the content of the information contained in the
completed application. The application shall also include a PSEBA medical
authorization release and a PSEBA general information release, executed and
notarized by the applicant. Both the PSEBA medical release and the PSEBA
general information release authorize the collection of information related to
the incident that qualifies the applicant for benefits under PSEBA, including,
but not limited to, the disability pension proceedings, worker's compensation
records and medical records.
The village president's review of the PSEBA benefit application will not occur
until the application is complete including the completion of the PSEBA medical
authorization release and a PSEBA general information release.
   B.   Application Review Process:
      1.   When the village president receives a complete and executed PSEBA
benefit application, the village president shall review the application and
engage in such additional fact finding and/or investigation as may be deemed
necessary or appropriate to evaluate the application, including, but not
limited to, the review of public safety pension board hearing transcripts and
decisions, workers' compensation documentation and independent medical
examinations.
      2.   If additional fact finding and/or investigation is determined to be
necessary, the applicant shall fully cooperate. If the applicant refuses or
otherwise fails to fully cooperate, then a written notice shall be sent to the
applicant reiterating the duty of full cooperation in the fact finding and/or
investigation process. If the applicant fails to cooperate as requested within
twenty one (21) calendar days after service of such notice, then the
application for PSEBA benefits shall be deemed withdrawn.
      3.   The village president shall make a written recommendation to the
board of trustees of the village, with a copy to the applicant, within forty
five (45) calendar days after the later of the following:
         a.   The submission of all documentation relevant to the PSEBA benefit
application; or
         b.   The completion of such additional fact finding or investigation
as deemed necessary or appropriate by the village president (as stated in
subsection B2 of this section).
The village president's written recommendation shall include the reasons for
the recommendation and shall state that:
         a.   The applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA; or
         b.   A hearing should be convened in order to determine whether or not
the applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA.
      4.   The village president's recommendation shall be presented to the
board of trustees at the next regularly scheduled village board meeting
(subject to the notice provisions of the open meetings act). At that meeting,
the village president and board of trustees shall:
         a.   Make the determination, by resolution, that the applicant is
eligible for benefits under PSEBA; or
         b.   Make the determination, by motion, that a hearing as set forth in
subsection 1-10-3C of this chapter should be convened in order to determine
whether or not the applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA. (Ord. 2015-
1095, 11-12-2015)
1-10-3: POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR HEARINGS FOR PSEBA BENEFITS:
If the village president and board of trustees make the determination that a
hearing should be convened, the village board shall convene a hearing which
shall be overseen by a hearing officer, appointed by the village president as
set forth in subsection B of this section, whose power and authority and
limitations are as follows:

president must consider the candidate's ability to perform the requirements of
a hearing officer and his or her knowledge and experience in administrative
practice, the rules of evidence, civil procedure, and laws concerning PSEBA and
other benefits for public safety employees.
   C.   Administrative Hearing: An administrative hearing shall be held, under
the guidelines set forth below, to adjudicate and determine whether the
applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA. If the applicant is found
eligible, the benefits shall be consistent with PSEBA.

administrative hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a determination of
whether the petitioning applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA. This
determination shall be in writing and shall include a written finding of facts,
decision and order. The determination by the hearing officer shall constitute a
final administrative determination for the purpose of judicial review under the
common law writ of certiorari.
      6.   Acknowledgment Of Determination: The hearing officer's determination
shall be presented to the board of trustees at the next regularly scheduled
village board meeting (subject to the notice provisions of the open meetings
act). At that meeting, the village president and board of trustees shall:

         b.   Decide, by motion, to timely appeal the hearing officer's
determination to the appropriate circuit court for judicial review regarding
whether or not the applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA. Once the
court (either the circuit court or any subsequent appellate court if the matter
is appealed further by either party) makes a final decision regarding whether
or not the applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA, the village board
shall, by resolution, acknowledge and accept the court's final decision.
      7.   Burden Of Proof: The applicant shall have the obligation and burden
of proof to establish that the applicant is qualified to receive PSEBA

3-3-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
   A.   It is hereby determined that:
      1.   Uninvited visits to private residential properties and privately
owned businesses for the purposes of soliciting funds, goods, wares,
merchandise or services by persons and organizations have been occurring and
continue to occur within the village.
      2.   Residents and business owners have complained that these activities
are intrusive upon their privacy and disruptive to their daily activities.
      3.   A variety of misrepresentations and other frauds are at times
employed in such activities.
      4.   Burglaries and attacks on persons in their homes have occurred by
persons claiming to be solicitors.
      5.   The village has a legitimate and substantial interest in promoting
the public health, safety, and welfare of its residents by preventing
fraudulent or criminal activities which may result from unregulated
solicitation.
      6.   Noncommercial speech is entitled to broader protection under the
first amendment to the United States constitution than commercial speech,
affording the village a greater ability to regulate commercial speech than
noncommercial speech.
      7.   An effective way to promote and protect persons' safety and privacy
is by reasonably limiting the hours of solicitation and requiring solicitors to
obtain permits in a content neutral manner. Allowing individuals to determine
their level of comfort with privacy and whether or not they want to receive
solicitation will promote the village's interest in promoting public safety and
protecting individuals' privacy, while respecting solicitors' interests in
effective distribution of information. A reasonable accommodation of these
competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this chapter, which
regulates the time, place and manner of solicitations.
   B.   Based on the findings described above, it is further found that there
is a need for narrowly tailored reasonable, time, place and manner restrictions
regarding soliciting within the village so as to accomplish the following, to
the extent reasonably possible:
      1.   Prevent crime, including burglaries and fraud, and deter such fraud
and crime by determining the identity of solicitors by requiring solicitors to
obtain a permit prior to soliciting within the village;
      2.   Protect the health, safety, welfare and privacy of the citizens of
the village;
      3.   Ensure that the police department is aware of the number and
identity of persons who will be soliciting for commercial and noncommercial
purposes, and the geographical areas and time periods during which such
activities will occur within the village;
      4.   Prevent the imitation of noncommercial purposes by persons and
organizations who would defraud the public, and thereby cause noncommercial
purposes and organizations to be endangered by the suspicions engendered by
such practices;
      5.   Protect the welfare, safety, peace, privacy, comfort and convenience
of the public in its homes, from unwanted disturbances and intrusions; by
reasonably restricting the hours of solicitation activities;
      6.   Prohibit the solicitation of occupants of property when the occupant
has posted a sign prohibiting such activities; and
      7.   Respect the solicitors' interests in effective distribution of
information. This chapter is expressly not intended to interfere with the
exercise of free speech and free exercise rights protected by the first
amendment (e.g., religious proselytizing, anonymous political speech, and the
distribution of handbills). (Ord. 2012-967, 7-12-2012)

on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials
used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is
extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross
charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel
termination point within a municipality that has imposed a tax under the act
and charges for the portion of the interoffice channels provided within that
municipality. Charges for that portion of the interoffice channel connecting
two (2) or more channel termination points, one or more of which is located
within the jurisdictional boundary of such municipality, shall be determined by
the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the
interoffice channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary
of the municipality and the denominator of which is the total number of channel
termination points connected by the interoffice channel. However, "gross
charge" shall not include any of the following:
   A.   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made
pursuant to: 1) the tax imposed by this chapter, 2) the tax imposed by the
telecommunications excise tax act, 3) the tax imposed by section 4251 of the

the period of time specified by the department of commerce and economic

in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under

wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations
and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service.
   G.   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a
sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made).
   H.   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin operated telecommunication
devices.
   I.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee act.
   J.   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: 1) those
charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are
taxable, 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and 3) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate or
terminate outside this state.
INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that originate and
terminate within this state.

through a sale at retail.

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.
RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE (Or Any Like Term):

agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or
whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.
SALE AT RETAIL: The transmitting, supplying or furnishing of telecommunications
and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith for a
consideration, to persons other than the federal and state governments, and
state universities created by statute and other than between a parent
corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or
permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving

specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this chapter, "private line" means
a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this act. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupation tax act. (Ord. 2002-664, 9-12-2002; amd. Ord.
2006-784, 8-10-2006)
3-9-2: TAX IMPOSED:
A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all of the following acts or privileges:
   A.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in

1, 2004, at a rate of 3.0 percent, of the gross charge for such
telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual
multimunicipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation
under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a
tax in another municipality on that event, shall be allowed a credit against
any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the
amount of the tax properly due and paid in the municipality that was not
previously allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person effective January 1,
2003 through December 31, 2003, at a rate of 1.0 percent, and effective January
1, 2004, at a rate of 3.0 percent, of the gross charge for such
telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual
multistate or multimunicipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject
to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer
has paid a tax in another state or municipality in this state on such event,
shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by
this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in
such other state or such tax properly due and paid in a municipality in this
state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or
local tax in this state.
   C.   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or privilege
to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality. (Ord. 2006-784, 8-10-2006)
3-9-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:

by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 2002-664, 9-12-2002)

telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and
information as required by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified
municipal telecommunications tax act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement this
act. (Ord. 2002-664, 9-12-2002)
3-9-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the
grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale
number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 2002-664, 9-12-2002)
3-9-6: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter, or the application of any provision of this
chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall
not affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that can be
given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its
application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter. (Ord. 2002-
664, 9-12-2002)

reject the taxpayer's appeal, and the original determination or assessment
shall stand. The local tax administrator shall rule on the taxpayer's appeal
within sixty (60) days of receipt of the written protest, and shall provide
written notice to the taxpayer of his or her decision.

the tax determination, audit or assessment shall become a final bill due and
owing without further notice.

payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the time

penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 0-2001-
623, 1-11-2001)
3-12-11: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local

payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the

the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 0-2001-623, 1-11-2001)

years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or, if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years after the end of the calendar
year in which return for the applicable period was due or after the end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed,

3-12-14: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 0-2001-623, 1-11-

franchise to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct a cable system

franchise or renewal shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide

renewal that are finally negotiated and accepted by the village and the

shall be consistent with federal and state laws and regulations.

of this chapter now in effect or hereafter made effective. Nothing in the

permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction.

enforce generally applicable ordinances necessary to the health, safety and

No person shall construct, install, maintain, or operate a cable system within
the village, or within any public ways of the village, unless a franchise has
first been obtained pursuant to this chapter, and unless such franchise is in
full force and effect. Such franchise shall not take the place of any other
license or permit which may be legally required of the company in order to
conduct such a business, or to construct or install buildings, structures,
facilities, or equipment within the village. (Ord. 2002-666, 9-12-2002)
3-13-7: FRANCHISE NONEXCLUSIVE; LIMITING NUMBER OF FRANCHISES:
   A.   Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The village may grant any
number of franchises subject to applicable federal and state law. The village
may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily
limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local
considerations such as:
      1.   The capacity of the public ways to accommodate multiple cables in
addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as
electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.
      2.   The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition,
such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the
disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights of way.
   B.   In the event the village grants an additional franchise to use and
occupy the public ways for the purpose of operating a cable system, said
additional franchise should only be granted under the same terms and conditions
as those imposed on the company previously granted a franchise pursuant to this
chapter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to avoid the village's receipt
of redundant or outdated equipment, to the extent that the company previously
granted such a franchise has provided specific equipment in satisfaction of its
obligation to support public, educational or governmental programming, the
village may require the subsequent franchisee to provide alternative equipment,
providing that the total financial commitment for said equipment is equal to
that provided by the previously granted franchise. (Ord. 2002-666, 9-12-2002)

The term of the franchise shall be as established in the franchise agreement

date of the franchise agreement, and the same shall continue in full force and
effect for the term specified in the franchise agreement unless otherwise
extended, terminated or revoked for cause as allowed pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter. (Ord. 2002-666, 9-12-2002)

hearing as provided above and without the need for a consideration of the
matter by the village board, may suspend the license of the game room for a
period of not to exceed seven (7) days.
In the event the village president has reason to believe that any continued
operation of the game room will immediately threaten the welfare of the
community, he may, upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for
such conclusion and without further notice or hearing, order the licensed
premises closed for not more than seven (7) days, giving the owner and operator
an opportunity to be heard during that period. In the event the game room
license is revoked, no new license for a game room shall be issued for the
premises within a period of one year from the date of the revocation. (Ord.

single family dwelling to license such property with the Village.

single family dwelling to vacate all tenants from said property within sixty
(60) days after the license has been revoked.

remove or deface any notices which have been posted pursuant to this Chapter.
   C.   License Suspension Or Revocation:
      1.   Suspension Procedures:
         a.   A license may be suspended by the Building Official when a
violation of applicable Village ordinances has been identified by the Village
and/or the owner, managing agent, or property agent has been properly notified
of the violation and given a period of time in which to correct the violation,
but has failed to do so. A license may also be suspended by the Code Official
when any information provided in the license application is determined by the
Code Official to be false.
         b.   When a license is suspended, the Code Official shall send notice
to the property owner, managing agent, or property agent and the tenant at the
last address provided on the most recent license application. The notice shall
be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall include
the following:
            (1)   Description of the single family dwelling sufficient for
identification;
            (2)   A statement of the reasons for the suspension;
            (3)   An explanation of the owner's right to appeal the suspension
to the Village Administrator; and
            (4)   If the owner changes his/her/its address or changes the
managing agent or property agent and fails to notify the Village Administrator,
such notice shall be sufficient if sent by certified mail to the owner's,
managing agent's, or property agent's last address provided on the last license
application.
         c.   An owner whose license has been suspended may request a re-
inspection prior to revocation. If, upon re-inspection, the Village
Administrator finds that the single family dwelling, in connection with the
notice which was issued, is now in compliance with this Chapter, then the Code
Official may reinstate the suspended license upon payment of a seventy five
dollar ($75.00) reinstatement fee. The request for a re-inspection shall not
stay the revocation of the license.
         d.   Any owner whose license has been suspended shall be entitled to
appeal the suspension to the Village President by filing a written petition
within twenty (20) days after the date of suspension. The Code Official shall
transmit to the Village President copies of all records and notices upon which
the suspension is based. A hearing shall be scheduled as soon as practical upon
receipt of a timely petition. The Village President, in considering any such
petition, may immediately revoke the license or continue the suspension to a
definite compliance date. The penalty for noncompliance shall be revocation by
the Village Administrator and/or prosecution of violations in the Circuit Court
or administrative hearings and any fines and penalties imposed by said court or
Administrative Hearing Officer. The Village President may dismiss the charges
and reinstate the suspended license upon proof of compliance or lack of
evidence of noncompliance. A seventy five dollar ($75.00) reinstatement fee may
be imposed after proof of compliance is shown.

         a.   A license may be revoked by the Village Administrator when a
petition for appeal has not been filed within twenty (20) days following the
date of issuance of an order of suspension. A license may be revoked by the

exist in a single family dwelling that requires the immediate vacating of a
structure as specified in the International Property Maintenance Code.

shall not be reinstated. The owner may, however, obtain a new license after all
violations have been corrected and by following the procedures for obtaining a
new license and the payment of appropriate fees as set forth in this Chapter.
         c.   If a license is revoked without having the opportunity of a
suspension hearing, owner has the right to appeal that revocation. The appeal
shall conform to division C1d of this section. Such an appeal shall not operate
as a stay of revocation until such time as the Village President renders a
decision on the appeal, unless the Code Official grants a request for a stay
upon a showing of good cause by the owner.
         d.   Whenever a license is revoked, the Code Official shall send
notice to the property owner, managing agent, or property agent at the last
address provided on the most recent license application. The notice shall be
sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. The Code Official shall also
notify all tenants of the single family dwelling by posting a notice on all
entrances to the single family dwelling. The notice to the tenants shall
include the following:

building. No openings shall be permitted on the inside walls except those
necessary for passage of air ducts. If warm air heat is used, no cold air
return shall be taken closer than thirty inches (30") from the level of grease
room floor.
In some instances, it is possible to have heater room door open from the office
room, where heater room door is sufficiently distant from grease room door to
make the travel of gasoline gas to the heater room a remote possibility. Added
safety provided if the floor of the office is higher than the floor of the
grease room, or if a six inch (6") concrete ledge is placed across the door
opening at the floor in the grease room door or furnace room door, or both, as
gasoline gas is heavier than air and these features tend to block its flow.
         b.   The following types of heat are acceptable without enclosure:
            (1)   Suspended, approved type, oil or gas fired, warm air
furnaces. These shall be suspended from the ceiling joists and shall be
approximately eight feet (8') above the level of the grease room floor. Cold
air returns shall be not less than thirty inches (30") from the level of the
grease room floor.
            (2)   Gas or oil fired unit heaters shall be mounted eight feet
(8') above the level of the grease room floor.
            (3)   Electric heating units and equipment located within the
possible path of vapor travel shall be designed and installed so as not to
create an ignition hazard and shall conform with the 1962 Edition of the
National Electrical Code, N.F.P.A. Pamphlet No. 70, as published by the
National Fire Protection Association.
            (4)   In single stall stations, a stove may be used if mounted
eighteen inches (18") above the floor. Oil heat is recommended.
            (5)   Stoves may be used in the office section if they are cut off
by partitions from the grease room and the stoves are mounted above the floor
level.
   C.   Greasing Pits:
      1.   Every greasing pit installed within a building or enclosed by three
(3) or more walls shall be ventilated by a vent duct not less than six inches
(6") in diameter (or equivalent cross-sectional area if a noncircular duct is
used.) Duct shall start within four inches (4") of the floor and shall be
extended on an upward diagonal or by an easy bend over to sidewall, thence
straight up through roof to a height sufficient to draw off gasoline vapors
which may accumulate in bottom of pit. Abrupt bends must be avoided and all
joints must be tight. Floor of pit shall pitch slightly toward corner where
duct is located to facilitate flow of gases to duct.
      2.   Gasoline or naphtha shall never be used to clean out any pit,
whether pit is located within a building or enclosure, or outside in the open.
      3.   No sewer connection shall be permitted from any greasing pit unless
protected with an approved grease trap which will effectively intercept greases
and oils and prevent their entry into the sewer. Trap shall be kept cleaned
out.
      4.   If electrically lighted, globes shall be of vaporproof construction
and wiring in conduit.
      5.   If sewer connection is permitted by the Village, an adequate grease
trap shall be provided to intercept greases and oils. Trap shall be cleaned out
at least every thirty (30) days. (Ord. 0-80-151, 3-13-80)

4-6-1: FINDINGS:
The growth of weeds, the presence of brush piles and dead trees, within the
village harbors pests and nuisance wildlife and poses safety risks which
interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property and tends to
depreciate the value of the property of residents of the village. (Ord. 2016-
1122, 6-9-2016)
4-6-2: HEIGHT LIMITS:
It shall be unlawful for anyone to permit any weeds, grass or plants, other

exceeding eight inches (8") anywhere in the village which is zoned A-2 or A-
3 under the village zoning ordinance excepting those areas authorized by the
village to exist in natural form; any such plants or weeds exceeding such
heights are hereby declared to be a nuisance. (Ord. 2016-1122, 6-9-2016)
4-6-3: NOTICE TO ABATE:
The building officer shall have the authority to serve or cause to be served a
notice upon the owner or occupant of any premises on which weeds or plants have
been permitted to grow over eight inches (8") high or on which dead trees or
piles of brush have been determined to be a safety hazard or nuisance by the
building officer or are found to be in violation of the provisions of this
chapter. The notice shall demand the abatement of the nuisance within ten (10)

4-6-9: TREE PRESERVATION:
4-6-9-1: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
This Section of the Code is structured to preserve, protect and enhance
critical infrastructure - the urban forest that is located on public land. The
complete urban forest is comprised of trees across all land uses and ownership.
This Section will regulate public property trees but recognizes that trees on
private property are part of the collective community resource.
The purpose of this Section is to recognize the services and function that
trees provide as a collective asset to the entire community and to state the
goals of the Village with respect to the protection, preservation, care and
planting of trees on public lands.
Specific goals of this section are to:
   A.   Protect, preserve and enhance the quality of life and general welfare
of the Village, its residents, and property owners; and conserve and enhance
the Village’s natural, physical and aesthetic environment.
   B.   Preserve, protect and enhance the urban forest to ensure that trees are
properly planted and maintained within the Village so that trees can protect,
enhance and preserve the quality of life for people within the Village.
   C.   Recognize that trees are an integral part of the infrastructure of the
Village and as such should be preserved, protected and cared for as other
critical Village infrastructure.
      1.   Trees absorb pollution from the air;
      2.   Trees absorb and sequester carbon dioxide;
      3.   Trees absorb and filter pollution from stormwater run-off;
      4.   Trees produce oxygen;
      5.   Trees reduce flooding;
      6.   Trees stabilize soils and reduce erosion;
      7.   Trees cool the surrounding area helping to reduce impacts due to
heat islands;
      8.   Trees reduce energy consumption by shielding structures from harsh
winds and sun;
      9.   Trees provide a buffer and screen against noise, light and
pollution;
      10.   Trees improve property values;
      11.   Trees improve commercial district buyer traffic;
      12.   Areas with trees have lower crime rates;
      13.   Areas with trees have higher levels of community interaction;
      14.   Trees provide important habitat for birds and other wildlife; and
      15.   Trees protect and enhance our quality of life.
   D.   Trees provide the Village collective benefits that extend beyond
property boundaries throughout the entire Village.
   E.   Recognize that larger trees provide larger benefits. When a large tree
is removed and replaced with a smaller tree the benefits and services are
reduced.
   F.   Recognize that some trees may have a condition that constitutes a
threat, danger or nuisance to the public or property within the Village or may
be dangerous to the health of other trees and vegetation in the Village. (Ord.
2023-1365, 5-10-2023)

the most recent edition of American National Standards Institute.
      (https://www.tcia.org/TCIA/TCIA/Build_Your_Business/A300_Standards/A300_
Standards.aspx)
   J.   It is recognized that diverse age structure of trees throughout the
Village is critical to the health of the forest structure and protects the
Village from catastrophic loss. Proper care and management of the urban forest
is critical for increased longevity of urban trees and shall be in compliance
with the most recent edition of American National Standards Institute. (ANSI
A300).
      (https://www.tcia.org/TCIA/TCIA/Build_Your_Business/A300_Standards/A300_

   K.   No person shall hinder, prevent, delay, or interfere with the Village
Administrator or their agents while engaged in carrying out the execution or
enforcement of this chapter. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-4: PLANTING:
   A.   The Village shall plant and maintain a healthy diverse urban forest to
improve the natural resources and quality of life for the residents living
within the Village.
   B.   The Village shall plant diverse species with the ratio of not more than
15% of any one family, 10% of any one genus or 5% of any one species. Diverse
species composition protects the Village from catastrophic loss.
   C.   All trees planted by the Village or their agent shall be planted
consistent with the most current edition of American National Standards
Institute (ANSI A300).
      (https://www.tcia.org/TCIA/TCIA/Build_Your_Business/A300_Standards/A300_
Standards.aspx)
   D.   Trees purchased by the Village shall be of a quality consistent with
the most current American Standards for Nursery Stock as approved by the most
current American National Standards Institute (ANSI Z60.1).
      (https://www.tcia.org/TCIA/TCIA/Build_Your_Business/A300_Standards/A300_
Standards.aspx)
   E.   It shall be unlawful to plant any tree or shrub in the public right-of-
way, or on other publicly owned property or Conservation or Preservation Area,
without prior written approval from the Village and, in the instance of the
Conservation or Preservation Area, the language on the recorded plat shall
prevail.
   F.   It shall be unlawful to plant any tree under utility wires that is
anticipated to grow to a height that will interfere with the wires.
   G.   The Village shall consider implementation of a contract growing
program. This contract will allow for stable pricing and broader species
diversity to improve the overall diversity of the urban forest. This contract
may be for a period of five (5) -ten (10) years.
   H.   The Village should provide education and outreach to private landowners
on the need for species and age diversity, proper selection and planting
practices, and how to select species for particular sites. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-
10-2023)
4-6-9-5: TREE CARE:
An urban forestry management plan is a critical document for the care and
preservation of one of the community’s most valuable assets. This plan will
define the needs and provide recommendations for the care and planting of trees
throughout the community, including outreach to private property owners to help
them care for their trees. This plan will also outline the budgetary and
staffing needs for management and planting of trees on public property. It is
recommended that the Sustainable Urban Forest Guide, produced by the U.S.
Forest Service, serve as a guide for development of the Village urban forestry
management plan. (See U.S. Forest Service Sustainable Urban Forest Guide)
(ttps://urbanforestrysouth.org/resources/library/ttresources/the-sustainable-
urban-f orest-guide-a-step-by- step-approach)
   A.   The Village shall develop an urban forest management plan that supports
this Section. This urban forest management plan shall cover, at a minimum, a
five year (preferably ten year) period, including budget projections. This plan
shall be reviewed annually by the Village staff and members of the Tree Board
and shall be updated as needed to support the needs of the Village.
   B.   Until an urban forestry management plan is in place, the Village shall
provide a standard of care, in compliance with International Society of
Arboriculture practices, where possible, for all publically owned trees to
enable these trees to live to maturity and provide maximum benefits. This would
include but not be limited to:
      1.   At a minimum, have an established watering program for newly planted
trees. (Newly planted trees are any trees planted within five years of
inadequate rainfall.)
      2.   Have an established pruning program that places all publically owned
trees on a 5 year pruning cycle. Pruning is to be accomplished under the
direction of a certified arborist and in compliance with American National
Standards Institute. Care should be taken to follow best management practices
including but not limited to good sanitation practices to reduce the spread of
infectious conditions and restriction of pruning based on species needs, e.g.
oaks should only be pruned when dormant.
      3.   It is recommended that during the pruning cycle, trees to be pruned
be identified by species, size and location and be rated for health and hazard
potential. A record of this report should be used as a guide for Village staff
to address problems and provide care as needed. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-6: TREE PROTECTION:
This Section applies to any work being conducted which may impact public
property trees.
   A.   Unless otherwise authorized by this Section, it shall be unlawful for
any person to remove, injure or undertake any procedure which will cause death,
substantial damage, or create a hazard, to any public property tree without
first obtaining a Tree Permit from the Village. In the case of tree management
practices, these practices shall comply with the most recent edition of the
American National Standards Institute.
   B.   In the event of any site improvement which may impact public property
trees, a Tree Preservation Plan is required, must be approved, and implemented
prior to the start of any work or delivery of any materials to the Building
Activity Area. The approved Tree Preservation Plan shall be available on the
site throughout the entire construction period until final approvals for all
site work has been received in writing.
   C.   In instances where construction or site work that requires heavy
equipment and that may impact trees on public or private property, all
appropriate tree protection measures must be taken and identified in the Tree
Preservation Plan.
      1.   Protective fencing is required for protection of any tree to be
preserved in place. Fencing shall be installed at a minimum distance of one-
foot, for every inch DBH of the tree, from the trunk of the tree. In the
instances of tree pits, fencing shall be located at the edge of pavement.
      2.   All protective fencing shall be in place before any construction or
material delivery is to take place. All protective fencing shall remain in
place until final approval of all site conditions is given in writing.
      3.   No equipment or materials shall be parked, driven or stored within
the protective fencing area or on the root zone of any tree.
      4.   For projects requiring the use of heavy equipment, such as anything
on which a person would ride with the exception of a riding mower, protective
tree fencing shall be required. This fencing shall be orange snow type fencing,
a minimum of 4 feet in height and held in place by metal posts driven into the
ground no more than 10 feet apart. In the instance of a project that will take
place for more than one year, chain link fencing will be required. Chain link
fencing shall be six feet in height and held in place by metal posts driven
into the ground no more than 10 feet apart. Fencing shall not be removed or
relocated unless authorized in writing by the Village.
      5.   No tree shall be impacted within the protective fencing area,
including the tree canopy.
      6.   All measures shall be taken to maintain the health of trees which
are transported to the replacement site and shall meet or exceed the
requirements of the most current American National Standards Institute. (Ord.
2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-7: LEGACY TREE PRESERVATION:
   A.   A Legacy Tree is a tree provided special designation by the Village.
The Village shall develop a Legacy Tree Program that supports this Section.
   B.   Removal of a Legacy Tree requires a Tree Removal Permit and may require
a special hearing with the Tree Board and Village Board.
   C.   Construction, development and/or any grading adjacent to a Legacy Tree
requires a Tree Preservation Plan. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-8: TREE REMOVAL:
Tree removals are considered an impact to the entire Village, whether on public
or private land. It is clearly documented that larger trees provide larger
benefits and as such, the tree removal fee of $100 will be assessed with an
approved Village permit and violation fines will be assessed based on the list
of preferred species and tree size determined by diameter (maximum fine by
Village Code is $750 per incident and will be applied on trees removed over 6"
DBH). It is recognized that the planting of smaller trees to replace the value
of larger trees that are lost will take tens of years and for this reason
efforts should be made to preserve and protect trees where they are growing.
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any individual to remove or cause damage to
any tree located on public property without first receiving a Tree Permit from
the Village.
   B.   No live, dead or dying tree, or grouping of trees, equal to 6" DBH or
greater on public property may be removed without first obtaining a permit from
the Village.
   C.   A nuisance tree is a tree that has already died, is in a state of
irrevocable decline, has the capacity to damage a person or thing or is an
invasive species. In the event of an emergency, and access to the Village is
not possible, a nuisance tree may be removed without a permit, however, the
individual removing the tree shall take photographs and memorialize the
nuisance situation prior to removal and shall follow up with a request for a
tree permit from the Village on the next business day.
   D.   Any tree removed from a parcel or transplanted offsite must be replaced
according to the regulations outlined in this Section.
   E.   All stump removals shall require underground utility locations prior to
any action.
   F.   If a tree is removed or damaged which is not on the Tree Permit it must
be replaced or bonded as set forth in this Section.
   G.   Removal of invasive woody plants such as buckthorn do not require a
permit and in fact, are encouraged. These invasive plants can quickly colonize
an area reducing the health and vitality of non-invasive plants. (A list of
invasive woody plants is provided in the Appendix.) (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-9: TREE REPLACEMENT:
   A.   It is required that tree replacement species come from the Preferred
Species List. (See list attached to this Section.)
   B.   Any tree which is required to be removed or which has been damaged
shall require a bond to be posted until adequate replacements or remediation
can be made. The bond amount is identified in the Fee Section of the Code.
Determination of extent of damage is at the sole discretion of the Village.
   C.   Any tree species removed, 6" DBH or 6" group of trees, which is not
identified on the invasive species list, but is identified on the Preferred
Species List, is required for replacement by this Section. Any Preferred Tree
Species removed shall be replaced with two (2) trees identified on the
Preferred Species List. All replacements shall be located appropriately as
confirmed by a certified arborist and as approved by the Village.
   D.   When a tree removal is required as a result of any project, tree
replacement shall occur within the landscape season. In the event of weather
conditions or species specific needs, which prohibit proper replacement of a
tree, the Village may issue written notice of an extension of up to 180 days
upon written request by the Applicant. If an extension is awarded to the
Applicant, the Applicant shall notify the Village when replacement is complete.
If, after the 30 day or awarded 180-day extension, the tree is not replaced or
the Applicant has not notified the Village that installation is complete, all
bonds shall be forfeited and the bond money shall be placed in the Tree Fund.
Tree removal requirements, associated with a development project, can be found
in the Development Section of the Code.
   E.   All tree replacement plantings shall require an underground utility
location prior to planting.
   F.   If the property where a removal has taken place does not have adequate
space to plant a replacement tree, then the Applicant shall be required to pay
the Village a dollar amount equal to the average cost of a tree on the
preferred species list. Funds shall be placed in the Tree Fund for tree
replacement or tree care in another area of the Village.
   G.   Is shall be encouraged that any species identified on the invasive
species list be removed. There is no replacement requirement for these
removals.

4-6-9-10: SPECIAL RULES FOR OPEN SPACE OR PRESERVATION AREAS:
If an Open Space or Preservation Area is impacted in any way, the following
restitution shall be required:
   A.   A cash bond (in addition to the Tree Permit Bond) is required for every
one thousand square feet of Open Space or Preservation Area as defined.
   B.   The purpose of this deposit is to pay for restoration of the Open Space
or Preservation Area damaged directly or indirectly as a result of the impact.
   C.   Any maintenance made necessary as a result of impact, including but not
limited to the removal of dead trees or preventative measures such as root
pruning or crown reduction of existing trees.
   D.   Any expenses incurred by the Village, as a result of the impact in
administering or enforcing the provisions of this Code.
   E.   The Cash Bond will be refunded one year after the repairs have been
made and all maintenance is completed and approved. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-11: TREE PRESERVATION AND/OR REMOVAL PLAN FOR SIGNIFICANT REMOVALS,
CONSTRUCTION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT:
An applicant seeking a permit for significant tree removals or tree removal
and/or planting related to construction and/or development shall comply with
all requirements of this Section. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-12: NUISANCE TREES:
A tree which is determined to be a nuisance tree is one which is dead or
declining and has the potential to damage other trees, people or structures.
These trees may be located on public or private property.
   A.   It shall be the duty of the property owner on any parcel to promptly
remove any trees which pose a risk.
   B.   Should the Village notify the property owner, in writing, of a tree
which is a potential risk, the property owner shall have thirty days to remove
the tree. If after thirty days the property owner has not removed the tree then
the Village shall take action to have the tree removed and shall provide to the
property owner a written invoice outlining all costs associated with the
removal, including but not limited to staff time, materials and oversight of
said removal. Should the property owner not reimburse the Village within thirty
days of issuance of a written invoice, the Village shall place a lien on the
property until all expenses related to the removal and subsequent hen are paid.
   C.   Infected, Infested Trees Due to a Pest or Pathogen Are Defined as a
Nuisance:
      1.   Any tree which is in a state of irreparable or untreatable decline
due to heavy infestation or disease is included in the definition of a
nuisance. Infested or infected trees, which are identified by Federal or State
Departments of Agriculture to be in quarantine or can potentially infect or
infest other trees are defined as a nuisance. This would include but not be
limited to Ash (Fraxinus) trees infested with emerald ash borer which are not
being treated or whose treatment is ineffectual, or Elm trees (Ulmus) infected
with Dutch elm disease.
         a.   The Village shall enforce State and Federal regulations governing
quarantine zone boundaries, and regulated articles.
         b.   For the purposes of this Section, “Regulated Articles” are hereby
defined as any insects at any living state of development, any quarantines
materials such as wood products including, but not limited to chips, limbs,
lumber, firewood or any other product or means of conveyance which may be
determined by Federal or State departments of agriculture to pose a risk of
spread of any infestation or infection.
         c.   It shall be illegal to move out of established quarantine zone(s)
regulated articles unless those articles have met all requirements of the
local, Federal and State regulatory agencies.
         d.   It shall be illegal for any person or entity to transfer from a
quarantine zone into a non-quarantine zone including the Village any regulated
articles.
         e.   Any person or entity found to be in violation of any local, State
or Federal regulations related to tree infestations or infections shall be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
         f.   All contractors working within and near any quarantine zone(s)
are required to comply with the quarantine regulations and supply records that
may be required for inspection to the Village, County, State or Federal
agencies upon request.
      2.   Trees in Decline or Dead Are Defined as a Nuisance:
         a.   Any tree or part of a tree which is dead which could potentially
fall on a person or structure is defined as a nuisance.
         b.   It shall be unlawful for any owner of any lot or land in the
Village to permit or maintain on any such lot or land, any tree which is dead,
or declining to the state where it may create a potential risk for structures
or people. It shall be the duty of any such owner to promptly cause the removal
of any such tree. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-13: INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROL:
   A.   Invasive Woody Plants: Invasive plants cause ecological disruption to
natural ecosystems. The type of impact varies based on the species and the
traits of that species. The Woody Invasive Species List, attached to this
Section identifies species which shall not be planted and which should be
removed and controlled to reduce impacts to other vegetation.
      1.   Typical impacts include:
         a.   Chemical disturbance to the soil limiting development of other
species;
         b.   Dense plant growth limiting light to soil surface resulting in
exposed soil allowing erosion;
      2.   Displacement of naturally occurring species resulting in a
monoculture of invasive species and aggressive tendencies.
      3.   Private Property Owner Outreach: The Village shall develop and
implement an outreach plan to educate property owners of the potential impacts
and remediation strategies, including a suggested planting list of alternative
species to assist property owners in dealing with the problem.
   B.   Invasive Diseases And Insects:
      1.   Impacts to Trees: Invasive diseases and insects can create
significant stress to trees and in some instances kill trees. Attached to this
section, the Village has developed a list of Invasive Diseases and Insects that
pose significant threats to trees from information identified by State and
Federal Departments of Agriculture.
      2.   Invasive Species Management Plan: The Village shall develop an
action strategy to deal with any of these diseases or insects and take action
to remove the pest, forestall impacts to the trees through treatments or other
means or develop a removal and replacement strategy for remediation of the
problem.
      3.   Private Property Owner Outreach: The Village shall develop and
implement an outreach plan to educate property owners of the potential impacts
and remediation strategies to help property tree owners in dealing with pests
or pathogens. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)

certified arborist. The Mayor shall designate one of the members to act as
chairman of the Tree Board, subject to the approval of the Village Board. A
member of the Village Board shall be assigned to be an ex officio member of
said Tree Board without the power to vote. The one alternate member shall
attend and participate in all meetings of the Tree Board, but shall only vote
in the event one or more of the full members is absent. All members of the Tree
Board shall be property owners of the Village, unless no certified arborist is
a property owner within the Village.
      2.   The appointed members shall serve for a period of three years. An
alternate member shall be appointed for a term of one year. If a vacancy shall
occur in the full membership, the alternate member shall be appointed to fill
such vacancy. Vacancies in full and alternate membership shall be filled in the
same manner as original appointments. The Tree Board members shall serve
without compensation.

4-6-9-15: TREE PERMIT PROCEDURE:
   A.   Applicant Submission: An applicant for a simple tree removal or
planting on public property shall fill out a Tree Removal or Tree Planting
Request, and the Village arborist shall make an inspection and render a
determination.
      If a removal or planting is significant or in conjunction with any type
of development, then a full tree preservation plan and inventory for the area
to be impacted may be required. The Village shall review the application. This
review shall include an inspection of the site and referral of the application
for recommendation to other appropriate administrative departments or agencies.
The Village shall render a decision on the application within ten working days
of its receipt of a properly completed application. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)

application and payment of a required fee and bond.
   B.   Time Limitation:
      1.   A permit shall expire and become null and void if work authorized is
not commenced within one year from the date of the permit or if such work when
commenced is suspended or abandoned at any time for a period of one year.
      2.   If work has commenced and the permit becomes null and void or
expires because of a lack of progress or abandonment, a new permit for the
proposed tree removal, planting activity shall be obtained before proceeding
with further work. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-17: CASH BONDS:
   A.   If tree replacement is required by this Section, then as a condition of
the Tree Permit, the Applicant shall submit a cash bond in the amount of $500.
The bond shall be held for the purpose of assuring that the replacement tree(s)
are purchased and planted.
   B.   If it is determined that practices which violate any portion of the
Village Code have resulted in tree damage, then the Village may require that a
cash bond of $500 be submitted at the time the violation occurs. The bond shall
be held for the purpose of assuring that all remedial actions to minimize tree
damage are taken, and/or for the purpose of assuring tree replacement should
any damaged tree die or show noticeable signs of decline as determined by a
certified arborist. If it is determined that residual damage may not be
apparent, then the bond may be held for a period of 60 months or five years. At
the end of which time, if the tree survives and is in good health, as
determined by a certified arborist the bond shall be returned. If the tree does
not survive, and was not further impacted by an act of God, or is in poor
health then replacement shall be required as identified above.
   C.   If the bond is posted for a tree and the property owner wishes to
transfer the property, then the bond shall be required to be paid before
transfer of the property or shall be refunded to the original property owner
once the bond requirements have been met. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-18: FINAL INSPECTION:
Final approval shall be issued when all relocation, replacement or remediation
of trees is completed and a final inspection has been conducted by the Village.
Should the Village determine that the season is inappropriate for planting then
relocation or replacement shall be deferred until the next planting season. All
bonds and fees will remain in the custody of the Village until final inspection
and approval has been provided in writing. (Ord. 2023-1365, 5-10-2023)
4-6-9-19: COMPLIANCE:

Approved Private Sewage Disposal Systems
   a)   General
The following systems are approved for individual on-site sewage disposal when
designed, constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with the village
of South Barrington septic system ordinances:
      1)   Septic Tanks & Field: Two tanks discharging into:
         a.   Subsurface seepage field with gravel-filled trenches
         b.   Chamber system
         c.   At-grade mound with class 1 aerator
         d.   Wisconsin mound with class 1 aerator
         e.   Illinois raised filter bed preceded by a batch treatment aeration
system
Note: No reduction in size of treatment area allowed when using an aerator.
      2)   State approved alternative type systems or technology will be
considered only for Planned Unit Developments, when the systems identified in
subparagraph a)1) above have failed and for lots that do not have suitable
soils for a conventional system. Soil investigation borings shall be done in
all areas that could potentially support a septic treatment system. This
investigation and subsequent design may limit the bedroom count and future
consideration of any construction activity such as, but not limited to, pools,
patios, and driveways. Such alternative type systems or technology will require
specific approval by the Village Board of Trustees and must be based upon
extraordinary circumstances or extraordinary site conditions and the
recommendation of the Village Engineer certifying that such conditions exist
and that no other alternative system or technology is suitable. Any alternative
type system or technology approved by the Village Board of Trustees must also
be compliant with all design, installation and submittal requirements set forth
by the State of Illinois and the Village Engineer. The specific approval shall
be evidenced by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Village Board of
Trustees. The Village Board of Trustees will not provide the required specific
approval for a self-inflicted difficulty or inconvenience such as a home
designed with an amenity or amenities (e.g., an enlarged pool) that requires
State approved alternative type systems or technology in lieu of the
conventional system.
   b)   See code.
The village enforcement officer shall review and approve all septic system
designs pursuant to this code. Every effort shall be made to approve and
install the best possible system which complies with this code and is
compatible with the site conditions.
Based on soil suitability tests, the proposed treatment system must meet the
hierarchy of systems listed in section 905.30 a-1 above, with either a or b
being the required first option and e being the last option if soils are
unsuitable for the other type of systems.

system site. The soil borings shall be approximately fifty (50') feet apart,
and the proposed subsurface seepage system shall be located within the area
where the soil borings were located. More intermittent borings may be necessary
for accurate and appropriate evaluation of a site where there is some concern
about the consistency of the soil materials. One of the borings shall be made
at the lowest elevation of the proposed absorption field area and within the
required set-backs. Borings shall extend a minimum of sixty (60") inches below
the natural ground surface. An observation pit shall be used in gravelly

enforcement officer may determine that any room, whatever named, whether
finished or unfinished, may have the potential for use or conversion to a
bedroom. For example, dens, sitting rooms, libraries, bonus rooms etc. whether
finished or unfinished, may be considered as "bedrooms" for septic field sizing
purposes. One factor which is used to determine if a room will be considered a
"bedroom" is whether it has access to a full bathroom, regardless if the
bathroom is finished, unfinished, or just roughed-in. Any and all rough-in
plumbing installed in a basement for future bathrooms accommodating a tub or
shower shall be considered at least one bedroom for purposes of designing and
installing a septic field.
   i)   Reserve Septic Treatment Area. An undisturbed area of sufficient size
is required to accommodate a reserve septic treatment area for future expansion
or replacement equal to fifty (50%) percent of the original size of the primary
field for systems without an aerator and twenty (20%) percent of the original
size of the primary field for systems with an aerator.

Said point of connection shall be the sanitary sewer main. "Maintenance" means
keeping the sanitary sewer connection, sewer lines and other sewer facilities
in satisfactory working condition and in a good state of repair (including, but
not limited to, preventing any obstruction of extraneous material or flows from
entering said facilities, protecting said facilities from any damage and
keeping same free from defects and malfunctions), and making necessary
provisions and taking necessary precautions to assure that said sewer
facilities are at all times capable of satisfactorily performing the services
adequately discharging the facilities are intended to perform, discharge or
produce. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-2-285: INSPECTIONS OF BUILDINGS TO BE CONNECTED TO SEWER SYSTEM:
   A.   Upon payment of the permit fee, the Village, or its designee, shall
make the following inspections of each building to be connected to the
wastewater sewer system:
      1.   An inspection shall be made at the time the sewer ditch is opened
and the connection is made to the wastewater sewer system to determine that
there is proper grade and connection.
      2.   An inspection shall be made before the fill is put around the
foundation and while the tile is still exposed around the foundation to see
that there has been no connection of such drain tile with the wastewater sewer
system.
      3.   A third and final inspection shall be made after the eaves troughs,
downspouts and sump pumps have been installed to see that there is no
connection of the aforesaid with the wastewater sewer system.
   B.   The provisions of applicable statutes, ordinances and rules and
regulations relating to excavations in streets shall be complied with in making
excavations in streets and other public places for sewer connections. (Ord. 99-
586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-3: WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES:
4-8A-3-300: PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES:
The Village may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up
and operating the Village's pretreatment program which may include:
   A.   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of
processing such applications;
   B.   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including
the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing
monitoring reports submitted by users;
   C.   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures
and construction;
   D.   Fees for filing appeals;
   E.   Other fees as the Village may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered
by this Chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties
collectable by the Village; and
   F.   Fees for all sampling and testing shall be the cost and expense
incurred by the Village plus twenty percent (20%).
Bills for monitoring services shall be sent out monthly for all customers and
shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the billing date. An additional
charge of the greater of ten percent (10%) of the amount due the Village or
twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be made on all bills which have not been paid
when due. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-3-310: SURCHARGE TO INDUSTRIAL USERS FOR DISCHARGE OF COMPATIBLE
POLLUTANTS:
   A.   All users shall comply with limits imposed by this Chapter upon the
discharge of compatible pollutants. Upon written request by a user, the Village
may, in its sole discretion, approve the discharge of such pollutants in excess
of the stated limits, provided that such user shall pay a surcharge calculated
in accordance with this Section. Approval of such discharge and the surcharge
requirement shall be set forth in the user's wastewater discharge permit.
   B.   Charges shall be based on the average of the parameters, singly or in
combination, for the population equivalent; for example, one hundred (100)
gallons per day, or two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) of CBOD, or two
hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) of TSS, or one hundred milligrams
per liter (100 mg/l) of FOG, or fifty milligrams per liter (50 mg/l) of ammonia
as N. Since billing is most conveniently based on the volume measured where
either CBOD or TSS or FOG or ammonia concentrations exceed the population
equivalent levels during the billing period, the volume actually measured
shall, for billing purposes, be increased by the ratio of the excess of actual
BOD*, TSS, FOG, and/or ammonia concentrations over the respective population
concentration levels. As an example, if the average concentration for the
billing period for the following constituents are:
 
CBOD = 250 mg/l
TSS  = 275 mg/l
For this example the surcharge shall be:
 
1 + 250(CBOD) - 200 + 275 (TSS) - 250 = a multiplier of 1.35
  200                250
times the volume actually measured. All measurements, tests and analyses of the
characteristics of water and waste to determine the industrial user surcharge
factors shall be conducted as under sections
4-8A-6-645 and
4-8A-6-650 of this chapter.
A COD measurement shall be made in place of CBOD whenever a sample contains
pollutants which interfere with the accuracy of the CBOD test. In such case the
upper limit for COD shall be five hundred (500) and used in the surcharge
formula in lieu of the CBOD portion.
 
Example: (mg/l) COD - 500
         500
   C.   Residential charges shall be considered as those normal to the ordinary
domestic activity or permanent residence of the village, whether discharged at
the actual residence or directly or indirectly within the village.
   D.   Nonresidential discharges shall be discharges which do not meet the
criteria for residential discharges.
   E.   All industrial users shall be charged for sample collection and
laboratory analysis by the village at the rate established by the village.
   F.   Environmental remediation fee:
 
               Unit Of Measure Amount
ERW volume fee Gallon          $1.00
(Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-3-320: CONNECTION FEES:
Prior to the issuance of a permit allowing connections with the wastewater
sewer system, the applicant shall pay to the village a connection fee
calculated as follows:
   A.   All Users: All users shall pay a connection fee based upon the number
of gallons per day discharged as estimated by the village. The connection
charge per gallon of daily discharge shall be determined by the village from
time to time. Written agreements approved and executed by the village prior to
the effective date shall supersede this section for purposes of determining the
connection fee for the property which is the subject of said agreement.
   B.   Fees: The connection fee is established by resolution of the village
board at a rate per gallon of estimated daily discharge as estimated by the
village.
Such fee is due in full prior to connection to the sewer, subject to adjustment
as provided below.
   C.   Nonresidential Connection Fees:
      1.   If, after the "measurement period", defined herein, of actual
discharge into the system, it is determined that the original estimated daily
discharge is not consistent with actual usage, an adjustment may be made to the
original connection fee by the village.
         a.   If the actual daily usage during the measurement period is less
than ninety percent (90%) of the amount of estimated daily discharge determined
for calculation of the connection fee, the user, within sixty (60) days
following the end of the measurement period, may apply for an adjustment in the
connection fee. If approved by the village, such adjustment will be made by
refunding the excess connection fee.
         b.   If the actual daily usage during the measurement period is more
than one hundred five percent (105%) of the amount of estimated daily discharge
determined for calculation of the connection fee, the village may assess an
increase in the connection fee to reflect such higher usage. Such increase will
be made by adding a surcharge to the regular monthly billing to be collected
over a period of time determined by the village.
         c.   If the user facility is of the type that has significant seasonal
adjustments, such as an outdoor swimming pool or recreation facility, the
"average daily discharge" shall be the average of the highest consecutive four
(4) months during the "measurement period" defined below.
      2.   Calculations of daily discharge shall be made by an individual
designated by the village and such calculations shall be rounded up to the next
thousand gallons. Adjustments will be subject to the approval of the finance
committee of the village board. The term "measurement period" means twenty four
(24) months; except that for users whose business operations predated the date
the sewer was commissioned (August 1999), the measurement period means twelve
(12) months.
   D.   Single-Family Residential Connection Fees: The estimated number of
gallons per day discharged for single-family residential units shall be
determined by the estimated population of the residence based upon the number
of bedrooms as shown in the following chart:
 
Bedrooms  Population Daily Gallons Of Discharge
2         2.017      201
3         2.899      290
4         3.764      376
5 or more 3.770      377
 
The daily gallons of discharge shown herein and the fee amount established
above shall determine the connection fee. Residential connection fees shall be
paid at the time of building permit issuance. (Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-3-340: USER CHARGES:
   A.   User charges shall be determined by the village from time to time. Each
user constructing a facility subsequent to the effective date of this chapter
shall, at its sole cost and expense, install a water meter, as approved by the
village engineer or his designee, on the potable water source serving the
subject property. Maintenance and repair of said water meter shall be the
obligation of the user. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any facility in
existence prior to the effective date of this chapter may utilize a flow meter,
as approved by the village engineer or his designee, for the purposes of
determining discharge at the discretion of the village engineer. The
construction, installation, maintenance and repair of said flow meter shall be
the obligation of the user.
   B.   The use charge is established by resolution of the village board at a
rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons of daily wastewater discharge. In
addition to the use charge, surcharges may be established for the following:
      1.   Restaurants, breweries or food processing facilities.
      2.   Users located outside the municipal limits of South Barrington.
(Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-3-341: REFUND FOR WATER USED FOR LAWN IRRIGATION:
   A.   The village will refund the user charges paid for wastewater that is
used for lawn irrigation between June 15 and September 15 of each year, in
accordance with the following provisions:
      1.   The water used for lawn irrigation was measured through the user's
primary water meter and the water customer paid a sewer user charge for such
water.
      2.   The user has installed a secondary water meter in accordance with
village standards that measures water used for lawn irrigation.
   B.   The refund will be made on the following basis:
      1.   The customer listed on the account has applied to the village for
participation in the refund program and agrees to comply with the provisions of
the program.
      2.   The village will read the secondary water meters on or about June 15
and September 15 to determine the amount of water used for lawn irrigation that
has been billed a sewer use charge.
      3.   The village staff will calculate the amount of the refund and
present the payment request to the village board for approval at their October
meeting. The refund will be made, less any administration fee established by
resolution of the village board. (Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-3-350: BILLS; WHEN DUE AND PAYABLE AND CHARGE FOR LATE PAYMENT:
Bills for sewer service shall be sent out bimonthly and shall be due and
payable twenty five (25) days from the billing date. An additional charge of
ten percent (10%) of the amount due the village shall be made on all bills
which have not been paid when due. The village may bill commercial users on a
monthly basis. (Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)

under oath and recorded. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to
any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual copying charges therefor.
   D.   After the board of trustees has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing:
      1.   The discharge permit be revoked and the service be disconnected;
      2.   That following a specified time the permit shall be revoked and
sewer service disconnected unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or
other related appurtenances have been installed and operated properly to comply
with the discharge permit;
      3.   The user to cease the unauthorized discharge effective after a
specified period of time; or
      4.   Such other relief as deemed necessary by the board of trustees to
abate the discharge be granted.
      5.   Further orders and directives as are necessary may be issued.
   E.   Following an order of revocation, the user shall cease discharging to
the village's wastewater sewer system. Failure to do so shall be evidence of
continuing harm to the village and provide grounds for the granting of
injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-5-587: TRANSFER OF PERMITS:

shall limit the authority of the village engineer to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-7-710: CONSENT ORDERS:
The village engineer or his/her authorized designee may enter into consent
orders of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
4-8A-7-720 and
4-8A-7-725 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Issuance of a
consent order shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-
10-2007)
4-8A-7-715: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The village engineer may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the village engineer and show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at
least three (3) days prior to the hearing, unless the village engineer
determines an emergency exists and less time is warranted. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, nor prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-7-720: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the village engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
village engineer may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self- monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order neither extends the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-7-725: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the village engineer or his/her authorized designee finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
village engineer may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the user to: (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999;
amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, nor a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-
1999)
4-8A-7-730: ADMINISTRATIVE SETTLEMENT IN LIEU OF CIVIL PENALTY:
   A.   When the village engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
village engineer may upon agreement of the user, enter an order of
administrative settlement in lieu of civil penalty against such user in an
amount not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). Such settlements shall be
assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long term average discharge limits, administrative settlements in lieu of civil
penalty shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
   B.   Users desiring to dispute such settlements shall file a written request
for the village engineer to reconsider the administrative settlements in lieu
of civil penalty along with full payment of the administrative settlement in
lieu of civil penalty amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the
administrative settlement in lieu of civil penalty. Where a request has merit,
the village engineer may conduct a hearing on the matter. In the event the
user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the user. The village engineer may add the costs
of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the administrative settlement in lieu of civil penalty. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999;
amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
   C.   Issuance of an administrative settlement in lieu of civil penalty shall
not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-7-735: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The village engineer or his/her authorized designee may immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The village engineer or his/her authorized designee may
also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the wastewater sewer system, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the village engineer may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the wastewater sewer system, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The village engineer may
allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the village engineer that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in section
4-8A-7-740 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the village engineer prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under section
4-8A-7-715 or
4-8A-7-740 of this chapter. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-
2007)
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-7-740: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
In addition to the provisions in section
4-8A-7-735 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
   A.   Violations of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations of wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purposes of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   E.   Violations of the pretreatment standards in sections
4-8A-4-400,
4-8A-4-420 and
4-8A-4-430 of this chapter. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under section
4-8A-7-715 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken.
Exercise of this option by the village engineer shall not be a bar to, nor a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-
1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-7-745: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the village engineer finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
village engineer may petition the circuit court through the village attorney
for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of
the user. The village engineer may also seek such other action as is
appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement imposed
by this chapter on activities of the user. The village engineer may also seek
such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A
petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, nor a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord.
0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-7-750: CIVIL PENALTIES/PENALTIES AND COSTS:
Any user who is found to have violated an order of the board of trustees or who
has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, any rules and
regulations, permits or orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount
not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00). For the purpose of this section, each day in which any
such violation shall occur or continue, shall be deemed a separate violation,
and a separate violation shall be deemed to have occurred for each constituent
found to exceed the limits established in this chapter during any such day. For
each separate violation, each such person shall be fined an amount not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). In addition to the penalties provided
in this chapter, the village may recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs,
court reporter fees and other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit
against the person found to have violated this chapter or the rules,
regulations, permits or orders issued hereunder. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-7-755: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
   A.   A user who wilfully or negligently violates any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per violation, per date. Each day on which a violation occurs or
continues shall be deemed a separate violation.
   B.   A user who wilfully or negligently introduces any substance into the
wastewater sewer system which causes personal injury or property damage shall,
upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or be subject to imprisonment for
not more than six (6) months, or both. Each day on which a violation occurs or
continues shall be deemed a separate violation. This penalty shall be in
addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage
available under state law.
   C.   A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day.
   D.   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine
of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day. Each
day on which a violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate
violation. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-7-760: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The village may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the
village's enforcement response plan; provided, however, the village may take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. (Ord. 99-586, 9-
9-1999)
4-8A-7-770: PERFORMANCE BONDS:
The village engineer may decline to issue a wastewater discharge permit to any
user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a previous
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a
satisfactory bond, with the village as beneficiary, in a form and of a sum not
to exceed a value determined by the village engineer to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-7-775: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The village engineer may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter,
a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that
it has obtained liability insurance or provides financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair any damage to the wastewater sewer system it may cause by
its discharge. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-7-777: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, village water service to the user may be
severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-7-780: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is
hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed
by the village engineer. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be
subject to the provisions governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the
village for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said
nuisance. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-7-785: RIGHT TO CUT OFF SERVICE; RECONNECTION PROCEDURE FOR NONPAYMENT:
   A.   The village shall have the right to discontinue its sewer service to
the user on due notice whenever the bills for sewer service, other charges,
penalties or fines pursuant to this chapter remain unpaid for thirty (30) days
after the due date specified, or in case the user fails to comply with, or
perform, any of the conditions or obligations for service.
   B.   A user's service so disconnected shall be reconnected after the user
has made settlement for all outstanding amounts owed, or has, to the village's
satisfaction, complied with or performed such other conditions or obligations
hereof which were in default, as the case may be. The user shall pay the entire
cost of disconnection and reconnection prior to reconnecting the service. (Ord.
99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-7-788: LIEN RIGHTS:
   A.   Whenever a bill for sewer service, including any charge, penalty or
fine pursuant to this chapter, remains unpaid sixty (60) days after it has been
rendered, the village may file with the Cook County recorder's office a
statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain a legal description of
the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the
village claims a lien for such amount as well as for all charges for sewer
service subsequent to the period covered by the bill.
   B.   If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises, the
village shall notify the owner of the premises if his address is known to the
village, whenever such bill remains unpaid for a period of ninety (90) days
after it has been rendered.
   C.   The failure of the village to record such lien claim or to mail such
notice, or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the
right to foreclose the lien for unpaid sewer bills unless specifically
prohibited by law.
   D.   Property subject to a lien for unpaid sewer service charges shall be
sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied
to pay the charges, after deducting costs as is the case in the foreclosure of
statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity or other
appropriate proceeding in the name of the village. The village may institute
such proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction
over such matters against any property for which the bill for sewer service has
remained unpaid ninety (90) days after it has been rendered. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-
1999)
4-8A-7-790: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE; UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection C of this section, are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the village
engineer within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset if this
information is provided orally, a written submission shall be provided within
five (5) days: (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. The requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-7-795: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section
4-8A-4-400 of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in sections
4-8A-4-420 and
4-8A-4-430 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the village was
regularly in compliance with federal, state, MWRD and local requirements. (Ord.
99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-7-799: BYPASS:
   A.   A user may allow any user bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. Such user bypasses are
not subject to the provisions of subsections C and D of this section. (Ord. 99-
586, 9-9-1999)
   B.   1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a user bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the village engineer, at least ten (10) days before the
date of the user bypass, if possible.
      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the village engineer of an
unanticipated user bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the user bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the
user becomes aware of the user bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the user bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the user bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the user bypass. The
user bypass does not result in a violation of any federal, state, MWRD, or
local law, rule, regulation or ordinance by the village.
   C.   1. User bypass is prohibited, and the village engineer may take an
enforcement action against a user for a user bypass, unless: (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-
1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
         a.   The user bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the user bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a user bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance;
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection B of this
section; and
         d.   The user bypass does not result in a violation of any federal,
state, MWRD, or local law, rule, regulation or ordinance by the village. (Ord.
99-586, 9-9-1999)
   D.   The village engineer may approve an anticipated user bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the village engineer determines that it
will meet the four (4) conditions listed in subsection C of this section. (Ord.
99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-8: MONITORING:
4-8A-8-800: MONITORING PROGRAM BY VILLAGE:
The village engineer may create a program for monitoring industrial user
discharges; provided, that any industrial user that has a population
equivalent, as determined by the village engineer, equal to or greater than one
hundred (100) shall be monitored no less than once annually. All other
industrial users would be monitored at such frequency as deemed necessary by
the village engineer. Monitoring shall consist of the taking and testing of
grab samples or twenty four (24) hour composite samples as deemed reasonably
necessary by the village engineer for determination of the population
equivalent of the industrial user. The monitoring data collected shall be used
to determine the population equivalent. In the event that a sampling manhole
does not exist, the "sampling manhole" shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected, until such time as the sampling manhole has been constructed.
Industrial user shall be subject to fees for sampling and testing of their
discharge as it pertains to the village's monitoring program. (Ord. 99-586, 9-
9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
Where required by the village, additional control manholes or sampling chambers
shall be provided at the end of each industrial process within an industrial
user's facility suitable for the determination of compliance with pretreatment
standards. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
4-8A-8-810: RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The village engineer or his/her authorized designee shall have the right to
enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with
all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder. Users shall allow the village engineer or his/her authorized
designee ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
   A.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall
make the necessary arrangements, with its security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the village engineer or his/her
authorized designee will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes
of performing specific responsibilities.
   B.   The village engineer or his/her authorized designee shall have the
right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's
operations. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
   C.   The industrial user may request that the representative of the village
state the purpose of any inspection, and further, may request that such
representative abide by reasonable safety and hygiene requirements. (Ord. 99-
586, 9-9-1999)
   D.   The village engineer may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary in accordance with section
4-8A-6-600 of this chapter. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by
the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated by the user biannually to ensure their accuracy.
   E.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the village engineer and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. (Ord.
99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
   F.   Nothing herein shall be construed to limit or restrict any industrial
user from exercising any right it may have to object to the nature and extent
of any inspection access request, or to object to any inspection access request
as not necessary to carry out the purposes of the village pursuant to this
chapter. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
   G.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the village engineer or his/her
authorized designee access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this
chapter. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
4-8A-8-820: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the village engineer or his/her authorized designee has been refused access
to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the village designed to verify compliance
with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the village
engineer or his/her authorized designee may seek issuance of a search warrant
from the circuit court. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd. Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-
2007)
4-8A-8-840: CONTROL MANHOLE DEVICE AND SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS; LOCATION,
CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND FACILITY MONITORING:
   A.   When required by the village engineer, the owner and/or occupant of any
property served by a building sanitary sewer carrying industrial waste shall
install a suitable control manhole in the building sanitary sewer to facilitate
observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when
required, shall include, but not be limited to, being accessible, safely
located, and provide for one hundred ten (110) volt hookup and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the village engineer. The
manhole shall be installed by the owner and/or occupant at his expense, and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible to the village at
all times.
   B.   When in the judgment of the village engineer there exists sufficient
volumes and/or quantities of contaminants that may interfere with the
performance of the wastewater sewer system, the village engineer may require
the owner and/or occupant of any property and/or an industrial user served by a
building sanitary sewer carrying industrial wastes to install composite
sampling equipment and/or flow measurement equipment. Said composite sampling
and flow measurement equipment shall be installed by the property owner and/or
occupant at its expense and shall be maintained by it as to be functional at
all times, safe and accessible to the village. (Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999; amd.
Ord. 0-2007-814, 5-10-2007)
   C.   The owner and/or occupant shall be responsible for monitoring its
effluent to ensure that its discharge meets village, MWRD, state and federal
laws and requirements. It is also responsible for having knowledge of the
contaminants in its wastewater and the specific limitations relative to its
discharge. Records shall be kept by the owner and/or occupant of the results of
all sampling and/or flow measurements. Such documentation shall be available to
appropriate village personnel at all reasonable times. Records shall be kept by
the owner and/or occupant no less than three (3) years or longer if required by
state or federal laws prior to discard or if an enforcement action is pending.
(Ord. 99-586, 9-9-1999)
   D.   Where composite sampling equipment is available, the village shall
utilize such composite samples for purposes of calculating surcharges pursuant
to section
4-8A-3-310 of this chapter. The average of all composite samples during the
monitoring period shall be used to determine the multiplier. Should the
composite sampling equipment malfunction or if it does not exist, the village
shall use composite grab samples of not less than four (4) aliquots in a twenty
four (24) hour period, unless the user agrees to less than four (4) grab
samples in a twenty four (24) hour period, to determine surcharges as set forth
in section
4-8A-3-310 of this chapter. The average of all grab samples taken by the
village during the billing period shall be used for the multiplier. Where
nonfunctional composite equipment exists and at such time that a grab sample
exceeds the limitations specified in section
4-8A-4-400 of this chapter for total suspended solids, ammonia, phosphorous or
grease, the village and waste generator shall split grab samples no less than
five (5) samples per week until the composite sampler is once again functional.
Should the composite sampler become functional prior to the end of the billing
period, composite samples shall be taken no less than five (5) per week for the
remainder of the billing period for computing the average of the grab and
composite samples to determine the billing multiplier. The village engineer
shall decide the time when split sampling will be taken. Should there be a
significant discrepancy between the owner's and/or occupant's test results and
the village's test results on split samples, the owner and/or occupant may
request billing to be based upon testing results from an independent testing
laboratory. Upon investigation by the village engineer as to the reasons for
the discrepancy in sample results, the village engineer shall take appropriate
corrective actions and/or authorized in writing the terms of using a certified
independent testing laboratory. The choice of independent laboratory shall be
at the discrepancy of the village engineer. All expenses incurred for
monitoring by an independent certified laboratory shall be at the expense of
the owner and/or occupant.
   E.   Should the village engineer find violations of standards set forth in
this chapter including sections
4-8A-4-400,
4-8A-4-420, and/or
4-8A-4-430 of this chapter, the village engineer may require the owner and/or
occupant to provide access for the use of laboratory testing equipment or to
contract for laboratory testing services and provide the village with a copy of
the test results of the constituent(s) monitored. Upon review of the products
and byproducts of the owner and/or occupant operation and the type of
wastewater that is indigenous to the operation, the village engineer shall also
stipulate what constituents are to be monitored to ensure proper performance by
the village sewerage system in compliance with this chapter, any MWRD
requirement, state and federal law.
   F.   Where nonfunctional or malfunctioning flow measurement equipment
exists, the water generator and/or industrial user shall notify the village
engineer within twenty four (24) hours of his or her knowledge of the
malfunction so appropriate interim measurement arrangements can be made. (Ord.

at any given time, the Village President may request that the Board of Police
Commissioners prepare a new Final Eligibility Register. If the new Final

scores will be forfeited.

four (24) hours of the seizure. The request shall be deemed filed upon delivery
to the Chief of Police in care of the South Barrington Police Department. The
preliminary hearing request shall be in writing and the Chief of Police or his/
her designee shall conduct the preliminary hearing within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt of the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or Village
holidays, in which case the preliminary hearing shall be heard on the next
business day after the request. All interested parties shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary hearing. The formal rules
of evidence shall not apply at the preliminary hearing, and hearsay evidence
shall be admissible only if it is of the type commonly relied upon by
reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the
preliminary hearing, the Chief of Police or his/her designee determines there
is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and
impoundment, he/she shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as
herein provided, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the Village a cash
bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00), and pays any applicable
towing and storage fees. If the Chief of Police or his/her designee determines
that there is no such probable cause to believe the vehicle was used or
operated during the commission or attempted commission of the offenses set
forth in subsection
6-6-1-B of this chapter, then the vehicle shall be returned to the registered
owner without penalty or other fees.

Village shall, within ten (10) days after a vehicle is seized and impounded,
notify the registered owner, lessee and any lienholder of record by personal
service or first class mail, postage prepaid, of the date, time, and location
of a hearing that will be conducted. The notice of hearing shall be sent to the
interested party’s address as registered with the. Secretary of State of the

shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time
prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of any
party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. Subpoenas
for the production of witnesses and records may be issued upon request and for
good cause. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing, and
hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is of the type commonly relied
upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after
the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence
that the vehicle was used or operated in connection with or during the
commission or attempted commission of any of those offenses set forth in
subsection
6-6-1-B of this chapter, or that the police officer had reasonable cause to
believe the motor vehicle was subject to seizure and impoundment, the hearing
officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly
liable to the Village for a civil penalty in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00), and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the
owner pays the civil penalty to the Village plus any and all fees to the tower
and/or Village for the towing and storage of the vehicle as the case may be.

hearing, the hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in absentia and, if
appropriate, enter an order finding in favor of the Village, a copy of which
order shall be sent to the registered owner, lessee and/or lienholder of record
by first class mail, postage prepaid. If at the hearing the hearing officer
finds that no such violation occurred, or reasonable cause did not exist, the
hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the vehicle and any bond
posted to the owner without assessing any fees or penalty. (Ord. 2014-1019, 5-

penalty is imposed, the Village may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and
enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as may
otherwise be provided in this chapter, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded
until the civil penalty is paid to the Village and any applicable towing and
storage fees are paid to the tower and/or Village, as the case may be, in which
case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally
entitled to possess the vehicle, or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed
of to satisfy a judgment and lien as provided by law. If the civil penalty and
applicable towing and storage fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after

determination may be sought, or within thirty (30) days after an action seeking

possession of a seized and impounded vehicle until the civil penalty and towing
and storage fees have been paid. However, whenever a person or other entity
with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure
proceedings prior to the date of the motor vehicle seizure or impoundment,
possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person or entity if the
lienholder of record agrees in writing to refund to the Village the amount of
the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all
lienholders of record, not to exceed the civil penalty, plus the applicable
towing and storage fees. (Ord. 2014-1019, 5-8-2014; amd. Ord. 2020-1257, 12-10-

procedures for constructing facilities on rights of way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights of way and the village as a whole.
   B.   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, parkways
and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   C.   Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of
way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   D.   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights of way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   E.   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   F.   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   G.   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   H.   Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights of way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. 2008-848, 3-13-2008)

By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 2008-848, 3-13-2008)
7-5-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the village administrator, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village
administrator may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 2008-848, 3-
13-2008)

to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this subsection.
      1.   No Interference With Village Facilities: No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the village engineer determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the village's
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village's utility facilities.
      2.   Minimum Interference And Impact: The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right of way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right of
way.
      3.   No Interference With Travel: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right of way.

right of way line or as near as practicable.
   C.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts, Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.

employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   G.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their

to the risk involved.
   H.   Appearance Standards:
      1.   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right of way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
   I.   Alternative Location Determined By Village Engineer: Notwithstanding
any other provision set forth in this section to the contrary, the village
engineer, in his or her professional discretion, may determine alternative
locations for the placement of utility facilities based on sound engineering
principles and judgement, and such other applicable standards set forth in this
section, other than the location(s) requested by an applicant. (Ord. 2008-848,

electric utility shall conduct all tree trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right of way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the village as permitted by law.
   B.   Other Utilities; Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right of way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within the rights of way whenever the corporate authorities
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is
reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or
upon, the rights of way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights of way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights of way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;

with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
village administrator or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.

whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified
in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The village administrator may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the village administrator may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village
administrator under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to
appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
village clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The village
board shall timely decide the appeal. (Ord. 2008-848, 3-13-2008)

neglect or refuse to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
subject to a fine of not less than seventy five dollars ($75.00) nor more than
seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense. Each day that the
violation is ongoing shall be considered a new offense and a new citation shall
be issued. The village shall not impose fines in excess of twenty five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00) per occurrence. There may be times when the village will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the village's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 2008-848, 3-13-2008)
7-5-23: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this chapter.

other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
   I.   Height Exceptions: If an applicant proposes a height for a new or
replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small
wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a
variation in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in
section
11-3 "Variations" of the zoning ordinance.
   J.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a

procedures, terms, and conditions set forth in section
11-3 entitled "Variations" of the zoning ordinance.
   M.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Village utility pole
or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   N.   Cooperation With Other Small Wireless Service Providers: As a condition
of any permit for installation of a new pole, small wireless support structure,
or other above-ground facility granted pursuant to this Chapter, permittees
shall be required to cooperate with other small wireless providers in
collocating additional small wireless facilities on poles and small wireless
support structures owned by the permittee, provided that such proposed
additional small wireless provider been issued permits for that location by the
Village as described herein. All permittees shall exercise good faith in
collocating other small wireless providers regarding sharing of the permitted
site, provided that such shared use does not give rise to a substantial
technical level of impairment of the ability to provide the permitted use (for
example, significant interference in broadcast or reception capabilities as
opposed to a competitive conflict or financial burden). Such good faith shall
include sharing technical information to evaluate the feasibility of sharing
utility poles or small wireless infrastructure. In the event that a dispute
arises as to whether a permittee has exercised good faith in accommodating
other users, the Village may require a third-party technical study at the
expense of the applicant, the permittee, or both.
   O.   Radio Frequency Compliance: Wireless providers shall comply with the
FCC's radio frequency emissions standards at all times. Wireless providers are
required to perform on-going monitoring of small wireless facilities to ensure
all equipment continues to operate within allowable FCC radio frequency
emission ranges and shall, on a quarterly basis, provide to the Village a
certification with supporting information confirming whether all of the
wireless provider's small wireless facilities within the Village operated in
compliance with all FCC radio frequency emission limits during the quarterly
reporting period. The certified quarterly report shall be delivered to the
Village Administrator by the thirtieth of the month following the end of the
calendar quarter. A wireless provider shall, upon request of the Village at any
time, perform radio frequency testing of all or specific small wireless
facilities, provide such testing results to the Village, and shall promptly
respond to all Village requests for information and/or cooperation with respect
to any of the foregoing. Village staff may, at the Village's option, accompany
the wireless provider or its agents in the performance of such testing. The
Village has the right, but not the obligation, to employ a qualified radio
frequency engineer to conduct annual random and unannounced testing of
permitted small wireless facilities to determine their compliance with all FCC
radio frequency emission limits. In the event the Village decides to perform
its own testing, the wireless provider shall allow the Village or its designee
to have supervised access to the areas near the small wireless facility for
inspections and field measurements. Any small wireless facility found not to
comply with FCC radio frequency emission standards shall be immediately
reported by the wireless provider to the FCC, with a copy of such report sent
at the same time to the Village Administrator, and shall be powered-down,
adjusted, repaired, and/or replaced, or shut off and/or removed by the wireless
provider within three (3) calendar days of the provider becoming aware of the
violation. Small wireless facilities that exceed the FCC's radio frequency
emissions standards are declared a public nuisance, and may be summarily abated
by the Village. Failure by a wireless provider to cure a shall result in a
revocation of the applicable small wireless facility permit, and/or a citation
for maintaining a public nuisance with a fine in the amount of seven hundred
fifty dollars ($750.00), with each day of continued operation without cure
being a separate violation. In the event the Village determines a small
wireless facility is not in compliance with any legal requirements or
conditions related to radio frequency, the wireless provider shall, in addition
to the foregoing, be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the
Village in connection with the investigation, testing, enforcement and/or
remediation of such noncompliance.
   P.   Annual Certification: Each year on July 1, a wireless provider shall
submit an affidavit to the Village which shall list, by location, all small
wireless facilities it owns within the Village, and shall certify (1) each such
installation remains in use; (2) such in-use facility remains covered by
required insurance; and (3) each such installation which is no longer in use.
Any small wireless facility that is no longer in use shall be removed by the
wireless provider within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery of the
affidavit.
   Q.   Utility Worker Safety: Prior to the commencement of construction of a
small wireless facility, the wireless provider must provide the Village with
any required safety precautions for individuals working on or near the facility
site. If refresher training, personal protective equipment, or tools are
required for safety purposes related to a small wireless facility collocated on
a Village-owned utility pole, then the wireless provider must reimburse the
Village for all of its actual costs of those elements. (Ord. 0-2018-1186, 7-12-

7-6-13: STEALTH, CONCEALMENT AND AESTHETIC STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose: The purposes of this section are to:
      1.   Provide a variety of locations and options for wireless providers
while minimizing the negative visual impacts associated with small wireless
facilities;
      2.   Encourage creative approaches in locating and designing small
wireless facilities that blend in with the surroundings of such facilities;
      3.   Provide standards that comply with the Telecommunications Act of
1996 ("the Telecommunications Act") and the Small Wireless Facilities
Deployment Act (50 ILCS 840/1 et seq.); the provisions of this section are not
intended, and shall not be interpreted, to prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting personal wireless services as defined in the Telecommunications
Act; and
      4.   Administer the provisions of this Chapter in such a manner as not to
unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal
wireless services, as defined in the Telecommunications Act.
   B.   Site location and development of small wireless facilities shall
preserve the existing character of the surrounding buildings and landscape to
the extent consistent with the function of the proposed small wireless
facilities. All small wireless support infrastructure and poles shall be
integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site to the extent practical. Existing on-site
vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance to the existing
topography shall be minimized unless such disturbance would result in less
adverse visual impact to the surrounding area. The following provisions
establish design and concealment standards for small wireless facilities.
      1.   Building Attachment: Small wireless facilities may be mounted to a
building if the antennas do not interrupt the building's architectural theme.
To the extent possible all small wireless facilities shall be concealed within
a structure that is architecturally compatible with the existing rooftop.
Rooftop additions shall be concealed on all sides.
         a.   Small wireless facilities attached to the side or roof of
buildings shall employ a symmetrical, balanced design for all facade mounted
antennas. Subsequent deployments will be required to ensure consistent design,
architectural treatment, and symmetry when placing antennas on the structure's
exterior with any existing small wireless facilities on the same side of the
structure.
         b.   The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical
reveals is prohibited unless demonstrated to be unavoidable.
         c.   New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels,
or other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if it complements the
architecture of the existing building.
         d.   Small wireless facilities shall utilize the smallest mounting
brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building.
         e.   Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of
antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance,
and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed conduit, cabling, and
wiring are prohibited.
         f.   Small wireless facilities shall be painted and textured to match
the adjacent building surfaces.
         g.   All installations of small wireless facilities shall have
permission from the pole/structure owner to install facilities on such
structure.
      2.   Signs:
         a.   Small wireless facilities replicating a sign shall be subject to
the requirements of chapter 10 entitled "Signs" of the zoning ordinance. A sign
permit is required unless the small wireless facilities are placed entirely
within an existing sign.
         b.   All antennas shall be completely screened by the facade of the
sign.
         c.   All cables and conduit to and from the sign shall be routed from
within the building wall or structure upon which the sign is mounted. Cable
coverings may be allowed on the exterior of the building wall in limited
circumstances in situations where they are minimally visible and concealed to
match the adjacent building surfaces.
      3.   Existing Or Replacement Utility Poles: An existing utility pole may
be replaced or altered to accommodate small wireless facilities and related
equipment subject to the following requirements:
         a.   Replacement utility poles shall conform to any design standard
for the surrounding zoning district, subdivision, or planned development,
including, but not limited to, historic districts as defined herein and planned
unit developments as described in chapter 6A entitled "Planned Unit Development
District" of the zoning ordinance. The replacement pole shall look
substantially the same as existing poles in the surrounding zoning district,
subdivision, or planned unit development.
         b.   When no design standard is identified for a particular zoning
district, subdivision, or planned unit development, replacement poles shall
match the height, width, color, and material of the original or adjacent poles.
The maximum height of any new or replacement pole shall not exceed limits
specified in section
7-6-4H, subject to any variation requested pursuant to section
7-6-4I. The Village may, likewise, approve minor variations of up to fifty
percent (50%) of the pole width or thirty inches (30"), whichever is greater,
when housing equipment within the pole base.
         c.   Replacement poles shall be located as close as possible to the
existing pole to be replaced, and the replaced pole shall be removed.
         d.   Wherever compatible with the pole design and technologically
feasible, all equipment and cabling shall be internal to the replacement street
lighting or traffic signal standard or otherwise camouflaged to appear to be an
integrated part of a utility pole. If equipment or cabling is not proposed to
be placed internal to the replacement pole, a concealment element plan shall be
submitted in accordance with the provisions of division C.
         e.   No Illumination: Small wireless facilities shall not be
illuminated.
         f.   Generators And Backup Battery: Generators are not permitted for
small wireless facilities. All proposed battery backups must be requested
through the submittal of a concealment element plan in accordance with the
provisions of division C.
         g.   Cabinet Location And Dimensions: The equipment cabinet for small
wireless facilities shall be the smallest amount of cabinet enclosure necessary
to enclose the equipment. Disconnect switches may be located outside of the
primary equipment cabinet.
         h.   Flush-Mounting And Pole-Top Antennas: In situations when interior
concealment is demonstrated to not be possible, the small wireless facility
shall, to the full extent permitted under the state electrical code and the
utilities' requirements, be flush-mounted on the subject pole, which means
mounting directly to the pole with little to no gap other than that which may
be required for the screws/bolts, or located at the top of the pole. Canisters
attached to the top of a pole shall not exceed the diameter of the pole unless
technically required and then shall not be more than fifty percent (50%)
greater than the diameter of the pole.
         i.   Antenna Design: Where an enclosure is proposed to house an
antenna, the antenna shall be located in an enclosure of no more than six (6)
cubic feet in volume, or in case of an antenna that has exposed elements, the
antenna and all of its exposed elements could fit within an enclosure of no
more than six (6) cubic feet. No more than four (4) antennas are permitted on a
single pole and with a total volume not to exceed twenty four (24) cubic feet.
         j.   Material And Color: If interior concealment described in division
B3d is not possible, the small wireless facility shall to the maximum extent
feasible match the color of the pole and shall be non-reflective.
      4.   New Poles:
         a.   In areas of the Village in which above-ground facilities are
allowed in the public right-of-way pursuant to section
7-5-15 entitled "Location of Facilities," the installation of a new pole for
the purpose of locating small wireless facilities is permitted only when the
applicant establishes that:
            (1)   The small wireless facility cannot be located on a site
outside of the public right-of-way such as a public park, public property, or
in or on a building whether by roof or panel-mount or separate structure; and
            (2)   The small wireless facility cannot be located on an existing
pole within the public right-of-way.
         b.   The applicant shall establish the foregoing requirements by
submission of competent documentary evidence that:
            (1)   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering plans;
            (2)   Existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small
wireless support structures are not of sufficient height to meet the
applicant's engineering requirements;
            (3)   Existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small
wireless support structures do not have sufficient structural strength to
support the applicant's proposed small wireless facility;
            (4)   The applicant's proposed small wireless facility would cause
electromagnetic interference with the existing utility poles, towers, base
stations, or small wireless facilities, or the existing utility poles, towers,
base stations, or small wireless facilities would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed small wireless facility;
            (5)   The fees, costs and contractual provisions required by the
owners of the existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless
support structures to share existing space, or to adapt existing structures for
sharing space are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are
presumed to be unreasonable;
            (6)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors which render existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small
wireless support structures unsuitable; and
            (7)   Applicants shall provide evidence that reasonable efforts to
develop an alternative location on an existing utility pole, tower, or small
wireless support structure have been made.
         c.   Any proposed new utility pole or small wireless support structure
proposed by an applicant shall comply with a preferred concealment technique as
described in division B3, or an approved concealment element plan as provided
in division C.
      5.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Standards; ADA Compliance Required: To
allow full use of the public right-of-way by pedestrians, bicycles and other
users, all ground-mounted equipment other than poles or wireless support
structures shall be housed underground in a vault meeting the Village's
construction standards. The location of wireless support structures,
replacement poles, and/or any new poles shall comply with the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), Village construction standards, and state and federal
regulations in order to provide a clear and safe passage within the public
right-of-way.
      6.   Maximum Noise Levels: No small wireless facilities or related
equipment shall be operated to produce noise levels above forty (40) decibels
as measured from the nearest property line to which the small wireless facility
is located.
      7.   Advertising Prohibited: No lettering, symbols, images, or trademarks
large enough to be legible to pedestrian or vehicular users of the right-of-way
or other persons occupying the space in the immediate area of the small
wireless facility, utility pole, or small wireless support structure shall be
placed on or affixed to any utility pole, small wireless support structure, or
small wireless facility other than as required by Federal Communications
Commission regulations or other applicable law. Small wireless facilities
concealed within signs or billboards shall not be construed to be in violation
of this prohibition.
   C.   Concealment Element Plan:
      1.   Concealment Element Plan Required: Applications for proposed small
wireless facility installations which do not conform to a preferred concealment
technique as identified in section
7-6-13B3 shall submit a concealment element plan. The plan shall include the
design of the screening, fencing, or other concealment technology for a base
station, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment
or facilities associated with the proposed small wireless facility.
      2.   Purpose Of Concealment Element Plan, Generally: Concealment element
plans should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of proposed small
wireless facilities using methods including, but not limited to, integrating
the installation with architectural features or building design components,
utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color and
texture, or the appearance thereof, as the surface or background against which
the small wireless facility will be seen or on which it will be installed.
Other concealment element approaches may include, but not be limited to, use of
street furniture concealment products such as trash cans, benches, information
kiosks, or other types of enclosures reasonably compatible to conceal ground
level equipment. Additionally, the use of a concealment support or device, such
as a clock tower, steeple, flagpole, tree, wayfinding sign, decorative pole
with banner, art work, street sign, or other applicable concealment structure
may be approved.
      3.   Review Of Concealment Element Plan: Where a small wireless facility
is proposed that does not comply with a preferred concealment technique as
specified in division B3, a concealment element plan shall be subject to
Village review and approval in conformance with the procedures, terms and
conditions set forth in section
11-3 of the zoning ordinance. (Ord. 0-2018-1186, 7-12-2018; amd. Ord. 2020-

8-5-6: Penalties
8-5-1: FINDINGS:
   A.   It is the determination of the Village that receive-only satellite
antennas of all sizes, shapes, varieties and uses constitute physical additions
to the Village of such a character and degree of unsightliness that their
construction, placement, installation and use require close examination and
constant review by the Village.
   B.   The apparent demand for installation of commercial and private
television receive-only antennas (TVRO's) in South Barrington have been cause
for concern since the industry supplying the TVRO's has not developed
recognized standards, the structures required are quite different in appearance
from typical structures anticipated by the ordinances of the Village, and the
structures can be unsightly nuisances not compatible with existing structures
and land uses in the Village.
   C.   In view of the foregoing and to provide for reasonable regulation, all
TVRO's shall be considered structures subject to all applicable ordinances of
the Village. (Ord. 0-85-220, 5-30-85)
8-5-2: PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Permit Required: It shall be unlawful to install a TVRO in the Village
without having obtained a permit therefor.
   B.   Application for Permit: Each application for a permit to install a TVRO
shall include all items generally required for the action sought (i.e., permit,
variation, etc.) plus the following:
      1.   Plot plan showing the proposed location of the TVRO on the property.
      2.   Plans and specifications for the installation, including elevations,
dish configuration, mount, foundation and any motorization.
      3.   Complete description of any vegetation on the property which is to
shield the TVRO.
      4.   Landscape plan for completely screening the installation from
neighboring and street view pursuant to, and as required by subsection 8-5-3D
of this Chapter.
      5.   Location of principal structures on adjacent lots.
      6.   Proof that the installation does not violate any covenant applicable
to the lot upon which the TVRO is to be located.
      7.   A permit fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), which shall be
returned in the event the permit is not granted.
      8.   Five hundred dollars ($500.00) cash bond to ensure compliance with
the requirements of this Chapter which shall be refunded upon inspection and
acceptance of the TVRO by the Building Officer or upon withdrawal, before
installation, of the application for the permit to install the TVRO. Said cash
bond shall be forfeited to the Village in the event the TVRO is installed and
the requirements of this Chapter are not complied with within sixty (60) days
after such installation.
   C.   Procedures:
      1.   An application for a permit for installation of a TVRO may be
obtained from the Village Clerk's office.
      2.   The application shall then be submitted to the Village Board and to
the Architectural Committee (if any exists) of the particular subdivision in
which the TVRO is to be located.

adequate for anticipated wind loads. Each TVRO shall be permanently ground
mounted. No TVRO shall be installed on a portable or moveable structure, such
as a trailer. Electrical connections must meet local and national building
guidelines as to installation 2 . Consideration shall be given to protection of
children as in the case of an attractive nuisance. (Ord. 0-85-220, 5-30-85)

11-4-1: PARK LAND DEDICATIONS:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or of a final plat
of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be required to
dedicate land for park and recreational purposes, to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the development, or cash contribution in lieu
of actual land dedication, or a combination of both at the option of the
village, in accordance with the following criteria and formula as set forth in
section
11-4-7 of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-1-1: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING PARK AND RECREATION LAND DEDICATION:
   A.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed
development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement shall be eleven (11.0) acres of land per one
thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the following
classifications:
 
Types Of Recreation Area    Minimum Size Range       Acres Per 1,000 People
Neighborhood playground     5.0 acres                2.5
Neighborhood park           3.5 acres                2.0
District wide park or play  4.0 acres                2.5
field
Community wide recreation   12 acres up to 30 acres  4.0
park
                                                                   
                           Total                    11.0
 
This contribution and/or dedication are based upon a review of available data,
studies and literature, including, but not limited to, the requirements of
surrounding communities. They shall be presumed to be correct and accurate and
shall be used in calculating cash contributions herein unless timely objected
to as provided herein. Objections to this section shall be made in accordance
with section
11-4-8 of this chapter. Failure to timely object to these requirements in
strict accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
   B.   Location: The comprehensive park and recreation plan and the "Standards
By Types Of Recreation And Park Areas" as adopted by the South Barrington park
district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A neighborhood park
site of not less than five (5) acres shall be considered a requirement. A
central location which will serve equally the entire development is more
desirable. In large developments, these sites can be located throughout the
development according to established standards for park area distances.
   C.   Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas: When subdividers
or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities,
it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational
services. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and
recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the option
of the board of trustees, be provided in the form of "private" open space in
lieu of dedicated "public" open space. Such private open space may include
water areas or land areas or a combination of both determined to be suitable
for recreation purposes. The extent of such credit shall be determined by the
board of trustees after consultation with the board of park commissioners of
the South Barrington park district, based upon the needs of the projected
residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the
general area. The village will notify the park district of a developer's
request for credit for private open spaces and recreation areas at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the plan commission meeting at which said request
will be reviewed.
In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply
a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of
recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his
obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specification of facilities
to be installed, must be approved by the village, and before any credit is
given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee
that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use
by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private "swimming clubs"
are included in this provision. A copy of "Suggested Criteria For Swimming Pool
Development" as adopted by the South Barrington park district shall be used for
the guidance of the developer. When an adjustment for private recreation areas
is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication
that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development
and then subtract the credit to be given; however, in no event shall the credit
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total park land dedication that would have
been required. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-1-2: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF PARK SITES:
Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be
practical, or when the proposed park site is determined by the village and
South Barrington park district to be inappropriate for park and recreational
purposes, the village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash
contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. Such cash contribution in
lieu of land shall be made in accordance with procedures in section
11-4-7 of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-1-3: DENSITY FORMULA:
The table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit, prepared by
Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc.,
Naperville, Illinois, and as updated from time to time by the consulting firm
shown in section
11-4-14 of this chapter, constitutes projections of anticipated population
density and is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends
in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount
of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu
thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or
developer pursuant to section
11-4-8 of this chapter.
A "bedroom" as used in this section shall include any room which may be used
for bedroom purposes, such as a den, study, loft or extra room located on any
floor in a dwelling unit which may be converted into a sleeping area and is not
clearly identified for some other specific purpose such as a kitchen (1 per
unit), dining room (1 per unit), living room (1 per unit), bathroom(s) and
family room (1 per unit).
The most recent version of the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land dedication
herein unless objected to as provided in section
11-4-8 of this chapter. Objections to the table of estimated ultimate
population per dwelling unit shall be made in accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter to the plan commission. Failure to object to the table
of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit in accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the table
of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit listed herein, he shall
submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to
be generated from the subdivision or planned development, and in that event
final determination of the density formula shall be made in accordance with
section
11-4-8 of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-2: SCHOOL SITE DEDICATIONS:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or a final plat of
planned unit development, the subdivider or developer will be required to
dedicate land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of the
residents of the development, or cash contribution in lieu of actual
dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village, in
accordance with the following criteria and formula and as set forth in section
11-4-7 of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-2-1: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION:
   A.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be
generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon
the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land
dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: 1)
estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the 2)
maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school
classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the 3) portion
of said minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such
school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres
of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the
estimated increased children in each such school classification.
   B.   School Classifications And Size Of School Sites: School classifications
and size of school sites within the village which shall be required to the
subdivider/developer shall be determined in accordance with the following

in accordance with the following criteria and formula and as set forth in
section
11-4-7 of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-3-1: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING FIRE/RESCUE LAND DEDICATION:
   A.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The development of new subdivisions
and planned developments increases the demands upon the existing fire/rescue
protection service provided in a proportionate and ascertainable manner and
create the need for additional fire/rescue, firehouse and training sites.
Studies reveal the need to develop additional fire/rescue protection services.
Therefore, as a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a
final plat of a planned development, each developer or subdivider shall be
required to dedicate land for fire/rescue facilities to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the development or shall be required to make a
cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication.
The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly on the

development shall bear directly on the amount of land required for dedication.
New development and increased population create greater demands for adequate
and efficient library services to meet the educational, cultural and
recreational needs of the citizenry. They create the need for additional
library facilities. The village hereby finds that the total requirement shall
be 2.5 acres of land per ten thousand (10,000) of ultimate population.
These requirements are based upon a review of available data, studies and
literature on the subject, as well as the library district's own internal
examination of library utilization and needs. They shall be presumed as the
appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any cash in
lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided herein.

11-4-7-1: CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CASH CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF DEDICATION OF
SCHOOL, PARK, LIBRARY AND FIRE/RESCUE SITES:
   A.   Cash Contribution Required; Held In Trust: When the development is
small and the resulting site is too small to be practical, or when the
available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or school,
fire/rescue or library sites or is in conflict with the approved comprehensive
school plan, the village, with the concurrence of the affected district, shall
require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the
land dedication.
The cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be
held in trust by the village and shall be used solely for the acquisition of
park and recreation land as classified above, which will be available to serve
the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or
development or for the expansion of other existing local park and recreation
lands that already serve such needs or for any other lawful park purpose or for
any park purpose agreed to by the owner, subdivider or developer at the time of
platting.
The cash contribution in lieu of dedication of school sites shall be held in
trust by the village and shall be used solely for the acquisition of land for
school sites to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that
subdivision or development or for the expansion of any existing school site
that already serves such needs or for any other lawful school purpose or for
any school purpose agreed to by the owner, subdivider or developer at the time
of platting.
The cash contribution in lieu of fire/rescue sites shall be held in trust by
the village and shall be used for the acquisition of land for fire/rescue
facilities or training sites to serve the immediate and future needs of the
residents of that subdivision or development or for the expansion of any other
existing fire station or training site that already serves such needs or for
any other lawful fire/rescue purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer

unless determined otherwise pursuant to section
11-4-8 of this chapter, that the land is zoned in a one-family dwelling
residential zoning district subdivided with appropriate frontage on a dedicated
street or road, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved as set
forth in section
11-4-7-6 of this chapter, and is otherwise property capable of being used for
residential development. Based upon a study of comparable real estate
transactions, it has been determined that the present "fair market value" of
such improved land in and surrounding the village is, as of the effective date
hereof, as follows:
      1.   Ninety eight thousand dollars ($98,000.00) per acre for purposes of
locating a park.
      2.   One hundred ninety six thousand dollars ($196,000.00) per acre for
purposes of locating an elementary or junior high school within School
Districts 220 and 300 and locating a high school within School District 300.
      3.   Three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00) per acre for
purposes of adding on to the existing high school in School District 220.
      4.   One hundred ninety six thousand dollars ($196,000.00) per acre for
purposes of locating a fire station.
      5.   Three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00) per acre for
purposes of locating and/or adding on to the existing library.
These figures shall be adjusted by the village board from time to time with
appropriate study and documentation. The "fair market value" as defined above
shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land dedication herein unless
timely objected to as provided in section
11-4-8 of this chapter. Objections to the "fair market value" as defined above
shall be made in accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter to the plan commission. Failure to timely object to the
"fair market value" as defined above in accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
   D.   Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Contribution: There will be
situations in subdivisions or planned developments when a combination of land
dedication and a cash contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when: 1) only a portion of the land to be developed is
proposed as the location for a park, school site, fire/rescue, library (that
portion of the land within the subdivision falling within a park, school site,
fire/rescue, library; location shall be dedicated as a site as stated above,
and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional
land that would have been required to be dedicated); or 2) a major part of the
local park, school site, fire/rescue, library, has already been acquired by the
particular district or village and only a small portion of land is needed from
the development to complete the site (the remaining portion shall be required
by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof for the rest of the
required land shall be required). (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-7-2: CONSUMER PRICE INDEX:
The fair market value identified in section
11-4-7-1 of this chapter shall be subject to a "CPI adjustment" which shall be
calculated on January 1, 2003, as a base year adjusted on January 1 in each
year thereafter. Annually, the "fair market value" shall be adjusted to an
amount equal to the "fair market value" multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the "all items" "Consumer Price Index For Urban Consumers (1982-84
= 100)" for Chicago, Illinois, published by the United States department of
labor's bureau of labor statistics ("CPI") for the month of December preceding
the adjustment and the denominator of which is the CPI for the month of
December 2002. If any index is calculated from a base different from the base
period 1982-84 = 100, such index shall be converted to a base period of 1982-84
= 100 by use of a conversion factor supplied by said bureau of labor
statistics. If the CPI is discontinued or replaced, such other governmental
cost of living index or computation which replaces the CPI shall be used in
order to obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained if the CPI
had not been discontinued or replaced. (Ord. 0-2007-839, 12-13-2007)
11-4-7-3: DENSITY FORMULA:
The table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit, prepared by
Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc.,
Naperville, Illinois, and as updated from time to time by the consulting firm
shown in section
11-4-14 of this chapter, constitutes projections of anticipated population
density and is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends
in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount
of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu
thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or
developer pursuant to section
11-4-8 of this chapter.
A "bedroom" as used in this section shall include any room which may be used
for bedroom purposes, such as a den, study, loft or extra room located on any
floor in a dwelling unit which may be converted into a sleeping area and is not
clearly identified for some other specific purpose such as a kitchen (1 per
unit), dining room (1 per unit), living room (1 per unit), bathroom(s) and
family room (1 per unit).
The most recent version of the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land dedication
herein unless objected to as provided in section
11-4-8 of this chapter. Objections to the table of estimated ultimate
population per dwelling unit shall be made in accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter to the plan commission. Failure to object to the table
of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit in accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the table
of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit listed herein, he shall
submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to
be generated from the subdivision or planned development, and in that event
final determination of the density formula shall be made in accordance with
section
11-4-8 of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-7-4: RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND:
When the comprehensive plan or the standards of the village call for a larger
amount of park and recreational land, school sites, fire/rescue and library, or
in a particular subdivision or planned development than the developer is
required to dedicate pursuant to this section
11-4-7, the land needed beyond the developer's dedication shall be set aside
and reserved by the developer for subsequent purchase by the village (at a
price determined at the time of reservation) or other public body designated by
the village, provided that such acquisition is made within two (2) years from
the date of approval of the final plat. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-7-5: COMBINING WITH ADJOINING DEVELOPMENTS:
Where appropriate, a public open space or a school site that is to be dedicated
should, if possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments
in order to produce usable recreation areas and/or school sites without undue
hardship on a particular developer. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-7-6: REQUIREMENTS FOR DEDICATED LAND:
   A.   Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purpose. Wetlands and floodplains may be accepted for village ownership and
maintenance, but shall not serve as a credit toward the required park site
dedication. Stormwater detention areas shall not be accepted for village
ownership and maintenance, and the portion of a detention area designed to
function primarily as a component of the storm water control system shall not
serve as a credit toward the required park site dedication. A park site shall
be not less than one acre in area. The village board reserves the right,
however, in its sole discretion, to accept in whole or in part, certain areas
such as, but not limited to, tree massings, prairie remnants, high quality or
unique wetlands, or other natural features as all or part of the required park
site dedication in furtherance of open space preservation that may be unique to
a given parcel or development. Wetlands, floodplains, detention areas,
retention areas and areas of steep slope shall not be accepted as park, school,
fire/rescue or library sites and shall not serve as a credit toward the
required park, school, fire/rescue or library site cash contribution in lieu of
land dedication.
In addition, the following site conditions and preparation standards shall be
met:
      1.   Slope:
         a.   Should not vary greatly in appearance from existing and adjacent
slopes;
         b.   Optimum slopes range from two percent (2%) minimum to five
percent (5%) maximum. No less than two percent (2%) slope is acceptable under
any circumstances;
         c.   Maximum allowable slope is ten percent (10%), except under
special conditions where greater slopes are desirable to enhance the use of the
site; and
         d.   On site drainage patterns shall be designated and constructed to:
            (1)   Ensure flow toward swales; and
            (2)   Ensure drainage away from active areas.
      2.   Grading:
         a.   Rough grading shall be completed at time of rough grading of
adjacent contiguous area;
         b.   Grading shall comply with village approved plans;
         c.   Subgrade shall be graded and compacted so it will parallel
finished grade;
         d.   Subgrade material shall be loosened and fine graded to a depth of
two (2) to four inches (4"). All stones over four inches (4") in size, sticks,
debris, rubbish and other foreign substances shall be removed; and
         e.   Finished grades shall be uniform in slope between points for
which elevations have been established.
      3.   Soils:
         a.   Soils shall not differ from those naturally occurring;
         b.   Soils shall not offer any restriction to the ultimate use of the
property;
         c.   Topsoil shall be spread evenly and lightly compacted to a minimum
depth of six inches (6") over the entire site;
         d.   Topsoil must be good, friable soils with good tillage and shall
be without any admixture of subsoil, clay, gravel, stones, debris, refuse, sand
or other subsurface elements;
         e.   Topsoil shall not be placed in a muddy or frozen condition;
         f.   Topsoil shall contain no toxic substances which may be harmful to
plant growth; and
         g.   Topsoil shall be spread no later than the placement of topsoil on
the first lot adjacent to the site.
      4.   Seeding:
         a.   All proposed park and recreational, school sites, and library,
shall be seeded and an acceptable stand of grass or vegetation established
prior to dedication of the area to the village;
         b.   Village approved ground covers and grasses shall be used for all
park and recreational areas suitable for the nature of the activity planned to
occur thereon;
         c.   Seeding shall be completed during the fall or spring planting
times, depending upon the recommended seed planting specifications;
         d.   Seeding shall be on moderately dry soil on a seedbed which will
easily accept and nurture germination of seeds;
         e.   Seeding shall be watered sufficiently so that the vegetation
becomes reasonably established; and
         f.   The developer shall be responsible for making necessary
reparations to the site caused by erosion or other damage. Reparations shall be
completed prior to acceptance of the site.
   B.   Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for
full service of electricity, natural gas, telephone and cable television, and
streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter, where applicable), as
applicable to the location of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the
requirements of the village ordinances and codes. The landscaping normally
included within the definition of "improved" sites under said ordinances and
codes may be deleted due to the delay time between dedication of any such
school site and the construction of school facilities thereon, except for
ground cover as required in this section. The site shall have direct access to
a fully improved street across at least twenty percent (20%) of the distance of
its perimeter. Park, school and library sites should ideally be accessible by a
bicycle/pedestrian trail, and any such access route onto the property shall be
at least twenty five feet (25') wide. Such access routes should normally be
dedications and not easements, depending on which entity of government is to be
responsible for said routes. Any vehicular access route leading to or on the
site shall be of sufficient size and good geometry to properly accommodate
vehicles that will access and traverse the site, including, but not limited to,
good principles of traffic circulation, accommodation of one-way and/or two-way
drives for school buses, separation of bus traffic from passenger automobile
traffic, bus drop off areas separate from publicly dedicated streets, guest and
employee parking areas, and the like. Such off street access routes, drives,
drop offs and parking areas will not be dedicated rights of way and shall be
the responsibility of the owner of the site to maintain.
   C.   Environmental Risk Audit: Prior to the conveyance of any land to the
village, park district, school district, fire protection district or library
district, the intended grantee shall be furnished with an environmental risk
audit prepared by an environmental professional meeting the minimum
requirements of 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii), certified
to and acceptable to the grantee, assuring the grantee that there are no
"hazardous substance(s)" (as defined hereinafter) on, under, to or from the
land. Said environmental audit shall be what is commonly referred to as a phase
I environmental audit, which shall meet the minimum requirements for a
preacquisition audit as set forth in 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)
(6)(E)(iii)(v).
In the event the phase I environmental audit does not conclude there is no
presence or likely presence of a release of substantial threat of a release of
hazardous substance(s) or pesticide on, under, to or from the land, the grantee
shall furnish a phase II environmental audit as set forth in 415 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii)(vi), including a soil toxicity analysis
and recommendation from said environmental professional, meeting the minimum
requirements of 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii), which
concludes that there is no presence or likely presence of a release or
substantial threat of a release of hazardous substance(s) on, under, to or from
the land, and certifying that, in the judgment of said environmental
professional, there is no reasonable probability that the land contains any
hazardous substance(s) in violation of any federal or state environmental
standards.
In the event said phase II environmental audit and/or soil toxicity analysis
discloses the presence or likely presence of a release or a substantial threat
of a release of any hazardous substance(s) at, on, under, to or from the land
to the conveyed, the grantor shall first cause all such hazardous substance(s)
to be removed at its sole cost and expense in accordance with all federal,
state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations and furnish the
intended grantee with a "no further remediation letter" from the governmental
agencies having jurisdiction over the cleanup prior to conveyance of any of the
land to the intended grantee.
Prior to the conveyance of the land, the subdivider or developer, as the case
may be, and the owner of the land to be conveyed, shall execute and deliver to
the intended grantee an environmental indemnification agreement, which form has
been approved by the village attorney, agreeing to defend, indemnify and hold
the village, its corporate authorities, officers, officials, employees, agents,
successors and assigns, and the park, fire/rescue, school district, or library
as the case may be, and its respective officers, officials, employees, agents,
successors and assigns, harmless from and against any and all liability,
claims, damages, causes of action and expenses arising out of the presence of
any hazardous substance(s) in, under or upon said land to be conveyed prior to
the date of conveyance.
"Hazardous substance(s)" includes without limitation:
      1.   Those substances included in the definitions of hazardous
substances, extremely hazardous substances, hazardous materials, toxic
substances, toxic chemicals, toxic wastes, hazardous chemicals, hazardous
wastes, solid waste and pesticides in CERLA, SARA, RCRA, HSWA, TSCA, OSHA,
FWPCE, Illinois pesticides act 1 , Illinois responsible property transfer act 2
and the Illinois hazardous materials transportation act 3 , 49 USC section 1801
et seq., as amended, and as they may be amended in the future, and in the
regulations promulgated pursuant to said laws.
      2.   Those substances defined in section 1003 of the Illinois
environmental protection act and in the regulations promulgated pursuant to
said act or other Illinois laws pertaining thereto.
      3.   Those substances listed in the U.S. department of transportation
table (49 CFR 172.101 and amendments thereto) or by the environmental
protection agency (or any successor agency) as hazardous substances (40 CFR
part 302 and amendments thereto).
      4.   Such other substances, materials and wastes which are to become
regulated under applicable local, state or federal law, or which are classified
as hazardous or toxic under federal, state or local laws, ordinances or
regulations.
      5.   Any material waste or substance which is: a) asbestos, b)
polychlorinated biphenyls, c) designated as a hazardous substance pursuant to
section 311 of the clean water act, 33 USC section 1251 et seq., (33 USC
section 1321) or listed pursuant to section 307 of the clean water act (33 USC
section 1317), d) explosives, or e) radioactive materials.
      6.   For purposes of this subsection C, hazardous substances shall
include petroleum or its byproducts as regulated under RCRA and any applicable
state law or regulations.
   D.   Suitability Of Soils At Site: The subdivider or developer, at its own
cost or expense, shall provide to the village, park district, school district,
fire district or library district soil boring data, soil compaction test
results and such other engineering studies, data and information pertaining to
the proposed park and recreational, fire/rescue, school, library or site, which
the village, park district, school district, fire district or library district
may request to enable it to determine the suitability of the proposed land
dedication for park and recreation, school sites, fire/rescue, or library. The
village shall have the right to reject any site which the village, in
accordance with sound engineering practices, is not suitable for site purposes.
   E.   Title Insurance, Survey, Assessment Plats: Each deed or other
instrument conveying land to the village shall be accompanied by:
      1.   A written commitment issued by a title insurer licensed to do
business in the state to insure the grantee's title to such real estate in an
amount equal to the value computed pursuant to section
11-4-7-1 of this chapter, with extended coverage over the general exceptions to
title and subject only to:
         a.   Real estate taxes not yet due and payable,
         b.   Covenants, conditions and restrictions which do not prohibit the
use of the subject property for library, school or park and recreational use,
         c.   Utility easements located within twenty feet (20') of the
boundary lines of the subject real estate (except where approved on the final
engineering plans approved by the village engineer),
         d.   Drainage ditches, feeders and laterals,
         e.   Underground pipe or other conduit, and
         f.   Acts done or suffered by or judgments against the grantees;
      2.   A current ALTA boundary line survey, certified to the grantee by a

survey standards, showing no encroachments; and
      3.   Except in instances where the real estate is to be conveyed is a lot
in a recorded subdivision, an assessment plat and tax division petition in a
form acceptable to the appropriate village authorities so the land to be
conveyed can be assigned its own permanent real estate index number (PIN) for
exemption purposes.
In addition, monuments must be established and the land staked immediately
prior to dedication of the property. The subdivider or developer shall pay for
the cost of the owner's title insurance in said amount, the ALTA survey, the
assessment plat and any and all costs in connection with the tax division.
   F.   Real Estate Tax Escrow: The developer shall pay the general real estate
taxes on the land not yet due and payable as of the date of transfer, and shall
deposit a sum of money in escrow with the intended grantee's attorney or a
title company licensed to do business in the state of Illinois, which is
prorated as of the date of transfer on the basis of one hundred ten percent
(110%) of the tax assessor's latest assessed valuation, the latest known
equalization factors and the latest known tax rate on the land. In the event
the previous tax information or the previous tax bill includes other property,
then the amount to be deposited in escrow shall be adjusted ratably based on
the net acreage of the land compared to the net acreage of the other parcels
covered by said tax bills. After the land has been divided for real estate tax
purposes and has been conveyed to the intended grantee, the grantee shall
proceed with due diligence to apply for a real estate tax exemption on the
land. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)

that is expected to occur within each district or village during the succeeding
ten (10) year period. The district or village may obtain the information
necessary to make this projection from sources such as, but not limited to:
municipalities, other units of government, agencies and consultants.
         d.   An identification of the amount of lands that will be necessary
within the district and village in order to accommodate the demands of such
projected new development, and an estimate of the public grounds acquisition
costs that will be incurred or have been incurred by each district in acquiring
such lands.
         e.   A general description of each classification of capital
facilities (including construction, expansion or enhancement of any public
facilities and the land improvement, design, engineering and professional costs
related thereto) that will be necessary within each district in order to
provide adequate capacity for the projected new development, and an estimate of
the capital facilities' costs that will be incurred by each district in
constructing such capital facilities.
      2.   Based upon the needs assessment, the park district, the school
district, fire/rescue district or library district shall provide the village
with an acquisition plan for lands and capital facilities. This acquisition
plan shall:
         a.   Project for a planning period of at least five (5) years, the
need for lands and capital facilities within the district or village;
         b.   Set forth a schedule for the acquisition of such lands and
facilities to meet the projected needs (which schedule may be conditioned upon
the availability of financing);
         c.   Indicate the size and general location of the needed lands and
facilities;
         d.   Identify the estimated or incurred costs of acquiring such needed
lands and facilities;
         e.   Set forth the anticipated funding sources for the acquisition of
such needed lands and facilities;
         f.   Determine the feasibility of acquiring the needed lands and
facilities based upon the district's current financial condition;
         g.   Determine the feasibility of acquiring the needed lands and
facilities based upon the district's or village's estimate of the revenues
(including, without limitation, cash in lieu of land dedication as required by
section
11-4-7 of this chapter) pursuant to the plan.
         h.   The impact on property taxes in the village assuming the plan is
implemented.
      3.   If the village deems it necessary, it may require an updated needs
assessment and plan for acquisition of land and capital facilities from the
district annually. The failure to require said assessment update shall not
invalidate the requirements of this section. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-10: TIME OF PAYMENT:
   A.   All land dedications and cash contributions imposed by this chapter
shall be due and payable upon final plat approval, unless otherwise determined
as provided in subsections B, C and D of this section. In calculating the fee
at the time of platting, the village will assume the maximum density permitted
under the zoning classification approved pursuant to the table in section
11-4-14 of this chapter. For example, if the subdivision in question is zoned
single-family, the village will assume for purposes of calculating fees
payable, pursuant to this chapter, that all houses will have four (4) bedrooms.
The amount determined by such calculation shall be paid prior to the signing of
the final plat of subdivision for the lots contained within said final plat.
Such amount shall satisfy the obligation under this chapter for the lots within
that final plat. Objections to these calculations for any particular final plat
shall be made in accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements
in accordance with section
11-4-8 of this chapter shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection
at a later time.
   B.   For any lot in a plat that had final plat approval prior to January 1,
1979, or any lot for which no payments have been made under this chapter, all
fees imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable at the time a building
permit is issued.
   C.   The village may agree that payment of fees be made at the time of
building permit issuance in consideration of which the owner, subdivider or
developer shall execute an agreement, agreeing that the fees payable will be
paid in accordance with the requirements of this section and further agreeing
that the fees may be expended for the purposes described in said section.
Requests for a delayed payment shall be made to the plan commission when
applying for approval of the final plat and must be approved by the village
board as a part of the final plat approval process. Such agreement shall be
recorded with the plat of subdivision.
   D.   In the event the village and owner, subdivider or developer agree to
enter into an agreement substantially in conformity with that shown in section
11-4-13 of this chapter, the cash contributions owed shall be based upon this
chapter, or as provided in such future ordinances amending or replacing this
chapter, which is in effect at the time the building permit is issued. In
calculating any cash contributions in lieu of land dedication payable at time
of issuance of a building permit, the village shall use the fair market value
as set forth in section
11-4-7-1 of this chapter and the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit in section
11-4-14 of this chapter or any amendments thereto and in effect at the time of
the contribution and building permit issuance. (Ord. 2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-11: MISCELLANEOUS:
The village recognizes the fact that developments may differ in their impact
upon a community. Consequently, the village reserves the right to negotiate
dedications that are different from those contained in this chapter when
annexing property to the village pursuant to an annexation agreement. (Ord.
2004-708, 4-8-2004)
11-4-12: AGREEMENT REGARDING THE RECEIPT OF DEVELOPER SUBDIVISION CONTRIBUTIONS
AND INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT:
   A.   Execution Of Agreement: Prior to the distribution of any cash or land
to a benefiting district, the benefiting government shall enter into an
agreement with the village as set out in subsection B of this section. The
village president and village clerk are authorized to execute said agreement on
behalf of the village without additional authorization of the village board.
Said agreement shall be utilized by the parties unless the village board
authorizes the execution of an agreement in another format.
   B.   Agreement:
   WHEREAS, the Village of South Barrington, Illinois, on behalf of itself, its
officers, employees and independent contractors (the "Village"), through its
ordinances or through the provisions of its annexation agreements has required
that developers make contributions to the Village, that the Village, in turn,
may make available for other government bodies that are affected by the
subdivision improvements; and
   WHEREAS, such contributions may be in land or in money and, when transferred
or paid over to those government bodies, inure in part to the benefit of those
government bodies and not entirely to the direct benefit of the Village; and
   WHEREAS, from time to time within the Village, and within other
municipalities, disputes have arisen regarding the validity and amount of such
contributions; and
   WHEREAS, the Village is willing, at its discretion, to continue seeking the
contribution of land or money but wishes to procure a commitment from other
government bodies benefited by the receipt of such contributions that those
government bodies will (a) acknowledge that the requirement that such
subdivision contributions be made are totally within the discretion of the
Village as to their existence, manner and amount; (b) pay the cost of defending
any lawsuit or other legal action that is filed challenging the appropriate
amount of the contributions, the time at which they are to be made or any other
aspect of the contributions; and (c) comply with the terms of a final and
nonappealable judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction
rendered in connection with any lawsuit; and
   WHEREAS, the Village is willing, in its discretion, to pay over or require
contributions only to other government bodies that execute this agreement
annually.
   NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED in consideration for the payment of money or
the transfer of the land to the Benefiting District, which the Village from
time to time may within its discretion cause to be made by developers that are
subdividing property, it is agreed between the Village, on behalf of itself and
its officers, employees and independent contractors, and
                      , a government body within the State of Illinois (the
"Benefiting District") as follows:
1. The Benefiting District acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in
the Village's ordinances and/or annexation agreements, the Village is not
obligated to cause the payment of money or the transfer of land to the
Benefiting District. The Benefiting District recognizes that the Village may,
at its sole discretion, amend its ordinances or annexation agreements or its
practices to discontinue the payment of subdivision contributions to the
Benefiting District.
2. A. In the event an objection filed under Section
11-4-8 or a lawsuit is filed against the Village, the Benefiting District, and/
or others by a developer that is subdividing property or any other person,
corporation or entity that challenges the appropriateness, amount, timing or
any other aspect of a subdivision contribution that, pursuant to the terms of
the Village's ordinances or annexation agreements, has been paid or is due to
the Benefiting District, then the Benefiting District does agree to pay the
costs and litigation expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred
by the Village in defending such lawsuit or legal action. The Benefiting
District shall pay the costs and expenses when and as incurred by the Village
but in no event more than once a month. As a condition precedent to the payment
of these costs and expenses, the Village shall submit to the Benefiting
District copies of the original statements reflecting the costs and expenses,
together with the non-privileged supporting documentation that may be
reasonably requested by the Benefiting District. If more than one Benefiting
District is affected by the litigation, each shall pay a portion of the costs
and expenses based upon their each Benefiting District's proportion of the
benefit that is being challenged.
B. The Village covenants and agrees that it shall employ competent and skilled
legal counsel to represent the Benefiting District and the Village, and further
covenants and agrees that it shall keep the Benefiting District fully advised
as to the progress and status of the litigation. In particular, the Village
shall provide to the Benefiting District copies of all pleadings filed in the
litigation and shall consult regularly (and shall cause its attorneys to
consult regularly) with the Benefiting District or its attorneys, as
applicable, as to the strategy for defending the lawsuit. In no event may such
litigation be compromised or settled by the Village without at least 30 days'
prior written notice to the Benefiting District. In the event that the
Benefiting District decides that it would prefer to be represented in the
litigation by legal counsel of its own choosing, then the Benefiting District
shall be free to retain its own legal counsel for that purpose and to intervene
in the litigation. In the event the Benefiting District shall intervene in the
litigation its legal counsel may take the lead in the litigation, however the
Village's legal counsel will continue to monitor the litigation and the
Benefiting District shall be responsible for such costs as may be incurred by
the Village. The Benefiting District shall still be liable for all sums that
have accrued pursuant to the above subparagraph 2-A and that remain due and
owing from the Benefiting District to the Village relating to the defense of
any lawsuit filed in connection with dedications required for cash in lieu
thereof collected for or distributed to the Benefiting District.
3. The Benefiting District shall further indemnify and hold harmless the
Village from any and all liability arising from Chapter
11-4 of the Subdivision Code of the Village, including but not limited to, the
general administration and handling of funds required by the Village and the
Benefiting District.
4. In the event that a final and nonappealable judicial determination is made
by a court of competent jurisdiction that contributions of land or money
received by the Benefiting District are, in whole or in part, excessive, the
Benefiting District shall promptly repay those contributions to the person who
procures such a judgment, together with all other amounts judged by the court
to be owing from the Benefiting District. In the event a judicial determination
should require the payment of damages or payment of the attorneys' fees of the
plaintiff's attorneys, in addition to the return of contributions held to be
excessive, the Benefiting District shall pay all additional amounts in the same
manner as is provided in paragraph 2-A.
5. In further consideration of the continued distribution of payments by the
Village to the Benefiting District of the subject contributions of land or
money, the Benefiting District agrees that its obligations under this Agreement
shall extend to both past and future cash and land contributions. All
distributions of cash payments shall be made in accordance with Village Code
Section
11-4-9, and any interest accrued prior to distribution by the Village shall be
retained by the Village.
6. Within ninety (90) days of the end of each fiscal year, every Benefiting
District that receives payments from the Village under this Agreement shall
submit a report to the Village describing the manner in which the payments have
been used and provide any additional information the Village may require. This
report shall include information requested by the Village, including, but not
limited to: the balance of funds held at the close of the prior fiscal year,
the amount of payments received during the fiscal year, the amount expended
during the fiscal year, the purpose of the expenditures and to whom paid, as
well as the balance of funds held by the Benefiting District at the end of the
fiscal year. When this Agreement provides that money turned over to Benefiting
District is to be used for a specific purpose or within a specific time period,
the report shall address those issues. If the Benefiting District should fail
to file such a report with the Village, the Village may delay the payment of
any additional funds due the Benefiting District until such time as a full
report containing adequate information is transmitted to the Village. The
Benefiting District understands that it will be asked to execute an indemnity
agreement similar to this Agreement on an annual basis and that the Village
shall not pay any additional funds due to the Benefiting District until such
time as the Village is in receipt of such annually executed indemnity
agreement.
This Agreement shall be terminable by either party for any reason or no reason
at all upon 30 days' prior written notice to the other party evidencing the
intention to so terminate this Agreement. But the termination of this Agreement
shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Benefiting District or the
Village with regard to claims or damages allegedly arising out of the Village's
efforts prior to termination to impose, collect or distribute contributions, or
to the actual distribution of subdivision contributions.

11-4-13: AGREEMENT BETWEEN OWNER AND VILLAGE TO DELAY PAYMENT OF CASH
CONTRIBUTIONS:
   A.   Authorization Of Agreement: Any owner, subdivider or developer wishing
to delay the payment of the contribution required by this chapter, shall enter
into an agreement with the village in substantial conformance with the
agreement set forth in subsection B of this section. The village board must
authorize such agreement at the time of final plat.
   B.   Agreement For Delay Of Cash Contributions For Parks And Recreation,
Fire/Rescue, School Lands, And Library:
The Village of South Barrington (the "Village") and,
                                  ("Owner") agree as follows. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Owner" is defined as the subdivider, developer, individual,
firm, association, syndicate, co-partnership, corporation, trust, or any other
legal entity having a proprietary interest of record in the subject property,
except that in the case of a trust the Owner shall be deemed to include the
beneficiary or beneficiaries and the trustee thereof. The term "Owner" also
includes the Owner's authorized agent or any person authorized by such owner to
apply for Village approval in connection with a final plat of subdivision,
building permit, or other improvement or development upon real property.
The Village has approved a final plat of subdivision or a final plat of a
planned development at the request of Owner for the real estate legally
described in Exhibit 1 attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Land").
Accordingly, pursuant to the Village's Code of ordinances, Chapter
11-4, certain cash contributions in lieu of dedications for, park and
recreation, fire/rescue, school lands and library are immediately due from the
Owner.
1. Owner has, however, requested that the payment of the aforesaid cash
contributions be delayed and that the same become due and payable on a per
dwelling unit basis at the time the Village issues a building permit for the
particular dwelling unit.
2. In consideration for the Village agreeing to delay the required payment of
the cash contributions in accordance with Paragraph 1 above, Owner hereby
agrees as follows:
a. The amount of cash contributions owed shall be calculated based upon Title
11 Chapter 4 of the Village Code of South Barrington, or as provided for in
such other future ordinance amending or replacing such Chapter which is in
effect at the time of the issuance of a building permit; and
b. Notwithstanding any present or future law, regulation and/or legal precedent
to the contrary, the unit of local government or benefiting district that is
the ultimate recipient of the subject cash contributions may expend such
contributions for any of the following purposes intended to serve immediate or
future needs of the residents and children of the Owner's subdivision or
planned development: (1) for the acquisition of land; (2) for site improvements
such as, by way of example, streets, curbs, gutters, storm water control, and
utility extensions; (3) for construction of capital facilities, including, by
way of example, new buildings and structures, and the expansion or enhancement
of existing buildings and structures; and (4) for legal, architectural,
engineering and "soft" costs related to the foregoing items (1), (2) or (3)
above.
3. Developer has reviewed Title 11, Chapter 4 of the South Barrington Village
Code regarding the dedication of lands or cash contributions in lieu thereof,
as well as all of the methodology, formulae, calculations, projections,
assumptions, numbers and other factors used to arrive at the land dedication
requirements of cash contributions in lieu thereof that are the subject of this
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Ordinance and Attendant
Calculations") and hereby acknowledges and agrees that:
a. Pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance, Developer has been offered the
opportunity to raise in a hearing before the Village, any objections relating
to acreage requirements, presumptions as to fair market value, the Table of
Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, or any other application of
the Ordinance; Developer has not raised such objections; Developer has thereby
waived the right to assert those objections.
b. Developer hereby waives any future right to object to or to institute any
legal action regarding Ordinance and Attendant Calculations.
c. Developer hereby acknowledges that Ordinance and Attendant Calculations have
been properly passed, calculated and imposed.
4. This Agreement constitutes a covenant that is appurtenant to and runs with
the Land. Either this Agreement or a memorandum thereof may be recorded against
legal title to the Land by either party hereto; provided, however, it shall be
a condition of the Village's issuance of the first building permit for a
dwelling unit on the Land that Owner shall provide satisfactory evidence to the
Village that this Agreement or a memorandum thereof has been recorded against
legal title to the Land.
5. Owner represents and warrants to the Village that it is the sole holder of
record fee title to the Land and is authorized and empowered to enter into this
agreement.
6. Except as modified herein, all provisions of Title 11, Chapter 4 of the
Village Code of South Barrington shall apply to this subdivision (final plat)
and development.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
the Village and the Owner have caused this Agreement to be duly authorized,
executed and entered into as of the             day of
                         , 200    .

12-1-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this
village by 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-
30-8, and 5/11-31-2. The purpose of this chapter is to maintain this village's
eligibility in the national flood insurance program; to minimize potential
losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface
waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise
utilization of water and related land resources. This chapter is adopted in
order to accomplish the following specific purposes:
      1.   To meet the requirements of 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/18(g),
rivers, lakes and streams act;
      2.   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or
drainage hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to
erosion;
      3.   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
      4.   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
      5.   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
      6.   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property
in the village by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance
program;
      7.   To comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood
insurance program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended;
      8.   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land
and water resources; and
      9.   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of
watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water
impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and
riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits and enhance community and economic development. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-
2007)
      10.   If there are any conflicts between this chapter and chapter 2 of
this title, the most restrictive requirements shall apply. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-
19-2015)
12-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A nonhabitable structure which is on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
ACT: "An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of
the state of Illinois", 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and
will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are
as specified in subsection 12-1-7B of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in section
12-1-5 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: A walled and roofed structure, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, including manufactured homes,
prefabricated buildings, and gas or liquid storage tanks. This term also
includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more
than one hundred eighty (180) days per year.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,

vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOOD MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction approval
by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this chapter, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that FEMA
will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries
or floodway as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or flood
insurance rate map, once the as built plans are submitted and approved.

through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface
elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood
protection should be required include emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include sewage
treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on stream lakes, and that portion
of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally depicted on
the FEMA FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year
frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to
the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%)
increase in velocities.
   A.   The floodways are designated for on the countywide flood insurance rate
map of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008. When two (2)
floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more restrictive floodway limit shall
prevail.
   B.   The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village that may be annexed
into the village are designated for Poplar Creek and tributary A to Poplar
Creek on the countywide flood insurance rate map prepared by FEMA and dated
August 19, 2008.
   C.   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated
floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located
on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation
is needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary,
IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate, including:
   A.   Construction, reconstruction, repair, or placement of a building or any
addition to a building.
   B.   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a
site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days. If the travel trailer or
recreational vehicle is on site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days, it
must be fully licensed and ready for highway use.
   C.   Drilling, mining, installing utilities, construction of roads, bridges,
or similar projects.

flooding.
NAVD 88: National American vertical datum of 1988. NAVD 88 supersedes the
national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 (NGVD).
NATURAL: When used in reference to channels, means those channels formed by the
existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A
natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its floodplain is not
constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or
cultivated; the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the
area with no substantial alteration of the course or cross section of the

without a gravity release. A detention facility provides for storage of storm
water runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a flood or
storm.
RIVERINE SFHA: Any SFHA subject to flooding from a river, creek, intermittent
stream, ditch, on stream lake system or any other identified channel. This term
does not include areas subject to flooding from lakes, ponding areas, areas of
sheet flow, or other areas not subject to overbank flooding.

loss buildings (see definition of Repetitive Loss).
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a structure taking place during a ten (10) year period in which
the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%)
of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started.
   A.   "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building. This term includes structures which have incurred
repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done.
   B.   This term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
      2.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" listed on the national

12-1-3: ADMINISTRATION OF CHAPTER IN GENERAL:
   A.   The building officer shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the
duties listed in section
12-1-4 of this chapter.
   B.   To fulfill those duties, the building officer should first use the
criteria listed in section
12-1-5, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain.
   C.   Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain,
the building officer must determine whether the development site is within a
flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within an SFHA or floodplain for which
no floodway has been identified.
      1.   If the site is within a flood fringe, the building officer shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
12-1-6 of this chapter be met.
      2.   If the site is within a floodway, the building officer shall require
that the minimum requirements of section
12-1-7 of this chapter be met.
      3.   If the site is located within an SFHA or floodplain for which no
detailed study has been completed and approved, the building officer shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
12-1-8 of this chapter be met.
   D.   In addition, the general requirements of section
12-1-9 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of section
12-1-6,
12-1-7, or
12-1-8 of this chapter.
   E.   The building officer shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall
meet the requirements of section
12-1-10 of this chapter.
   F.   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the building officer
shall review the requirements of section
12-1-11 of this chapter to make sure they are met. In addition, the building
officer shall complete all notification requirements.
   G.   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in
this chapter, the building officer may take any and all actions as outlined in
section
12-1-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
12-1-4: DUTIES OF BUILDING OFFICER:
The building officer shall be responsible for the general administration and
enforcement of this chapter, which shall include the following:
   A.   Determining The Floodplain Designation:
      1.   Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a
special flood hazard area (SFHA).
      2.   If they are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway,
flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile.
      3.   Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA
(with a drainage area less than 1 square mile), indicating that the development
would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which
would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain
and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this chapter.
   B.   Professional Engineer (PE) Review:
      1.   If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one
square mile, the permit shall be referred to the village engineer for review to
ensure that the development meets section
12-1-7 or
12-1-8 of this chapter.
      2.   In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in writing
that the development meets the requirements of section
12-1-7 of this chapter.
   C.   Dam Safety Requirements:
      1.   Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage
potential in the event of failure.
      2.   The construction or major modification of all class I (high hazard)
and class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit.
      3.   Some class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety
permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and
the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off channel detention basins that
have an embankment are nonjurisdictional class III dams. It is not required
that IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all nonjurisdictional class III dams.
      4.   A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a
hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is
required.
      5.   A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the
construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams.
      6.   Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or
impoundment structures. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
   D.   Other Permit Requirements: Ensure any and all required federal, state
and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a watershed management
permit.
   E.   Plan Review And Permit Issuance:
      1.   Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the
jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of the WMO and the
requirements of this chapter; and
      2.   Issue a watershed management permit in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when the
development meets the conditions of this chapter. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
   F.   Inspection Review:
      1.   Inspect all development projects before, during and after
construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
      2.   Schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and
document the results of the inspection.
   G.   Damage Determinations: Make damage determinations of all damaged
buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged
structures which must comply with subsection 12-1-9C2b of this chapter.
   H.   Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates:
      1.   Maintain permit files including:
         a.   An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building subject
to section
12-1-9 of this chapter; and/or
         b.   The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been
floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to
section
12-1-9 of this chapter.
   I.   Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies
of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional
letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as
built" elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all
buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
   J.   State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to sections
12-1-7 and
12-1-8 of this chapter, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to
the village. Upon acceptance of this chapter by IDNR/OWR and FEMA,
responsibility is hereby delegated to the village as per 92 Illinois
administrative code 708 for construction in the designated floodway and
floodplain when floodways have not been defined in sections
12-1-7 and
12-1-8 of this chapter. However, the following review approvals are not
delegated to the village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      1.   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per Illinois
Compiled Statutes;
      2.   IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in
section
12-1-2 of this chapter and all other state, federal or local unit of government
projects, including projects of the village and county, except for those
projects meeting the requirements of subsection 12-1-7B1 of this chapter;
      3.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per subsection 12-1-7B3e of this chapter;
      4.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to subsection 12-1-
7B3d of this chapter;
      5.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent

improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve
the administration of this chapter;
      2.   Submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a
regulatory map within six (6) months whenever a modification of the floodplain
may change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain
map;
      3.   Submit reports as required for the national flood insurance program;
and
      4.   Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this chapter.
   L.   Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary
to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject, however, to
the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any chapter changes. (Ord.
2007-832, 9-5-2007)
12-1-5: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
   A.   This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance
study for the village.
      1.   If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is
not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other
sources.
      2.   When a party disagrees with the best available data, it shall submit
a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data
and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any
development of the site.
   B.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
Poplar Creek and tributary A to Poplar Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-
year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by
FEMA dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may
be prepared from time to time.
   C.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook
County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or
revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   D.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an "AH zone" or "AO zone" shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County. (Ord.
2008-859, 6-12-2008)
   E.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A zone" on the countywide flood insurance
rate map of Cook County shall be according to the best existing data available
from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an
engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood
elevations in accordance with WMO section 601.6. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
12-1-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of
this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of
section
12-1-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
   A.   Watershed Management Permit:
      1.   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by
law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
watershed management permit from the building officer.
      2.   Application for a watershed management permit shall be made on a
form provided by the building officer.
         a.   The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site,
drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the
property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor;
existing grade elevations, using the North American vertical datum of 1988, and
all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and other applicable
requirements of article 3 of the WMO. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
         b.   For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section
12-1-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
      3.   Upon receipt of a watershed management permit application, the
building officer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
         a.   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher
than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which
has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
         b.   The building officer shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate
map identification.
      4.   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall
be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
      5.   The building officer shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or
waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The building officer
shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits
have been obtained.
   B.   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
      1.   LOMR Based On Fill: If fill is being used to elevate the site above
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall
submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for
the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
      2.   Compensatory Storage:
         a.   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
         b.   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
         c.   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be
made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
         d.   All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All
floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
         e.   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
   C.   Construction Of The Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE):
A person, who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes
a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to
elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the village to
construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood
fringe. The building officer shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant
has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsections:
      1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection B2 of this
section.
      2.   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, accessways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE). (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
      3.   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the
FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet (10') beyond the outside face of the
structure.
      4.   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of twenty feet (20') from the structure, shall be above the BFE. (Ord.
2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
      5.   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet (5') thick under
the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F,
if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification
and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according
to ASTM standard D-2487, "Classification Of Soils For Engineering Purposes".
      6.   The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the
soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the
same direction.
      7.   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by an Illinois registered professional engineer, as warranted by the
site conditions.
      8.   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five feet (5') below the BFE.
      9.   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and
minimum of one-fourth (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4)
times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away
from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the
floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
      10.   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
      11.   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-
5-2007)
      12.   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth in the preceding subsections, the building officer may allow the
construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates
that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set
forth in the WMO and FEMA technical bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from
flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably
safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis
of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall
be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA technical bulletin
10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois registered
professional engineer. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
      13.   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in
no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously existing natural
grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation,
if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to
drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-
2007)

   B.   Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses:
      1.   Approved Appropriate Uses: The only development in a floodway which
will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base
flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or
aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate
mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses
listed in 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 will be allowed. The
approved appropriate uses are as follows:
         Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways
and any modification thereto.
         Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a watercourse.
         Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage.
         Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.
         Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure.
         Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including, but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building is improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before
the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will
be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
         Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
         a.   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will
not exceed 1.0 foot; or
         b.   The applicant of a short term recreational use facility parking
lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and
accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank
flooding events.
         Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any 1
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block flood
flows nor reduce floodway storage.
         Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls.
         Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access
to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and
facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses.
         The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building;
provided, that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building
was damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the
damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood
protection elevation.
         Underground and overhead utilities.
      2.   Uses Not Included: Appropriate uses do not include the construction
or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on
stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise
nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically
defined above as an appropriate use.
      3.   Engineering And Mitigation Criteria: Within the designated floodway,
the construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible;
provided, that the proposed project meets the following engineering and
mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans,
calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that
any structure meets the protection requirements of section
12-1-9 of this chapter:
         a.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood
Stages Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            (1)   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where
"n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, "Open Channel Hydraulics", McGraw-Hill, New York, 1959).
            (2)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing
and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover.
            (3)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer
can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more
abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
               (A)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
               (B)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length.
               (C)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet
(10') of stream length shall be used.
               (D)   Transition sections shall be provided between cross
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
               (E)   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
         b.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream
Flooding:
            (1)   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
            (2)   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to
at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
            (3)   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
            (4)   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the
location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall
demonstrate through a determination of flood discharges and water surface
elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
            (5)   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a
result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at existing structure.
         c.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream
Erosion Or Flood Heights:
            (1)   For all appropriate uses, the requirements of section 601.1.B
of the WMO must be met.
            (2)   For all appropriate uses, the requirements of section 601.1.C
of the WMO must be met. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
         d.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches:
            (1)   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
               (A)   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section
12-1-5 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any
commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models.
               (B)   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per
subsection B3b of this section.
               (C)   Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection B3c of
this section.
               (D)   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is
used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be
received.
               (E)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the
bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this
subsection B.
               (F)   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall
be designed per subsection B3h of this section. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
         e.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts, And
Approach Roads:
            (1)   The requirements of section 602.18 of the WMO must be met.
(Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
            (2)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
            (3)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 (floodway
construction in northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and
concurrence before a permit is issued. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
         f.   On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water:
            (1)   The requirements of section 602.18 of the WMO must be met.
(Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
            (2)   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must
be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
            (3)   All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section
12-1-2 of this chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Illinois
administrative code part 3702 (construction and maintenance of dams). If the
proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
               (A)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest
by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater
detention;
               (B)   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;
               (C)   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation
basin;
               (D)   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
               (E)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of
this section.
         g.   Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures:
            (1)   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of
the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no farther than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building.
            (2)   Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be
required for floodproofing activities.
         h.   Excavation In The Floodway:
            (1)   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and
culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
            (2)   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
               (A)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
and
               (B)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length; and
               (C)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet
(10') of stream length shall be used; and
               (D)   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
         i.   Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
            (1)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment
of a streamside buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable
if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat;
            (2)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
            (3)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
               (A)   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
               (B)   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at
both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they
will prevent erosion.
               (C)   One sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
               (D)   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to
that which is essential for construction of the channel.
               (E)   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or riprap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete,
gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
               (F)   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall
be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
               (G)   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such
features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and
flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established,
where appropriate.
               (H)   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end
of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
               (I)   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and
all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
               (J)   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
               (K)   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
            (4)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
         j.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
(Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
         k.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in
the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
            (1)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected.
            (2)   Stabilization of disturbed areas must, at a minimum, be
initiated within one working day whenever any clearing, grading, excavating, or
other earth disturbing activities have ceased on any portion of the site, or
temporarily ceased on any portion of the site and will not resume for a period
exceeding fourteen (14) calendar days. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
            (3)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
            (4)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25')
in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along
existing channels (see subsection B3p of this section). Construction vehicle
use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be
constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or
along channels shall be restabilized immediately.
            (5)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures And Standards For Urban
Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" (1988) also known as the
"green book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
         l.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements

            (1)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in section
12-1-5 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If
the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR
shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base
conditions data to use.
            (2)   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of
the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
               (A)   The requirements of this section for the 100-year
frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
               (B)   Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.
            (3)   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or
a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         m.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision:
            (1)   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
            (2)   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging,
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
            (3)   In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
            (4)   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.

            (1)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within
at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
            (2)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during
the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
         p.   Conditional Approval: After receipt of conditional approval of
the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional
letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway
designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction
that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated
floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The
designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by
IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as built" plans.
      4.   Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State
Review: For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the

structures on an existing single-family platted lot, may be constructed with
the lowest floor below the flood protection elevation in accordance with the
following:
            (1)   The building is not used for human habitation; and
            (2)   All areas below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be constructed with waterproof material. Structures located in
a designated floodway shall be constructed and placed on a building site so as
not to block the flow of floodwaters and shall also meet the appropriate use
criteria of section
12-1-7 of this chapter. In addition, all other requirements of sections
12-1-6,
12-1-7, and
12-1-8 of this chapter must be met; and
            (3)   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation; and

"designated floodway" as defined in section
12-1-2 of this chapter. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
      1.   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the MWRD or the
village for a variance. Only the MWRD can issue variances to the WMO
requirements, but the village may issue variances to standards that exceed the
WMO requirements. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
      2.   The building officer shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the village. The village may
attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to
further the flood protection intent of this chapter.
   B.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all
of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA; and
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted; and
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary; and
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety,
beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation
of a nuisance; and
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations,
policing, or repairs to streambeds and banks, roads, utilities, or other public
facilities; and
      6.   The provisions of subsections 12-1-6B and 12-1-8A2 of this chapter
shall still be met; and
      7.   The activity is not in a designated floodway; and
      8.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      9.   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the area involved including existing stream uses; and
      10.   All other required state and federal permits or waivers have been
obtained.
   C.   The building officer shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of section
12-1-9 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage; and
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant will acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   D.   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site
or historic structure as defined in definition of "historic structure", in
section
12-1-2 of this chapter, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of subsections A and B of this section, subject to the conditions
that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure; and
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
12-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
   A.   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study.
   B.   Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes.
   C.   This chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside
of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage.
   D.   This chapter does not create liability on the part of the village or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord.
2007-832, 9-5-2007)
12-1-13: PENALTY:
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   B.   The building officer shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      1.   The building officer is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing,
shall indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if
necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop
work order constitutes a suspension of the permit. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
      2.   No site watershed management permit shall be permanently suspended
or revoked until a hearing is held by the zoning board of appeals. Written
notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state: a) the
grounds for complaint or reasons for suspension or revocation; and b) the time
and place of the hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to present evidence on his/her behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the zoning board of appeals shall determine whether the permit shall
be suspended or revoked. (Ord. 2015-1061, 3-19-2015)
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
12-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
   B.   Where this chapter and other chapters, easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions, shall prevail.
   C.   This chapter is intended to repeal the original chapter or resolution
which was adopted to meet the national flood insurance program regulations, but
is not intended to repeal the resolution which the village passed in order to
establish initial eligibility for the program. (Ord. 2007-832, 9-5-2007)
CHAPTER 2
WATERSHED MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
SECTION:
12-2-1: Adoption Of The WMO
12-2-2: WMO And Amendments To The WMO
12-2-1: ADOPTION OF THE WMO:
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to promote the health, safety and
general welfare of the present and future residents of the village and
downstream drainage areas by providing for the protection, preservation, proper
maintenance and use of village watercourses, lakes, ponds, floodplain and
wetland areas. The watershed management ordinance (WMO) adopted by the
metropolitan reclamation district of Greater Chicago amended July 10, 2014, as
amended from time to time, is hereby adopted by reference as chapter 2 of this
title. This chapter is more specifically adopted. (Ord. 0-2015-1062, 3-19-2015)
12-2-2: WMO AND AMENDMENTS TO THE WMO:
The watershed management ordinance, commonly referred to as the WMO is hereby
amended and supplemented by the following provisions which correspond to the
articles as numbered in the code.
Article 1 see WMO
Article 2 see WMO
Article 3 see WMO
Add § 300.8 The co-permittee may be required by recommendation of the village
engineer and in accordance with subsection 11-2-2B9 of this code, to file with
the village a cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit, satisfactory to the
village attorney in an amount deemed sufficient by the village engineer to
cover all costs of the required improvements, landscaping, maintenance of
improvements and landscaping and soil erosion and sediment control measures for
such a period as specified by the village, and engineering and inspection costs
to cover the cost of failure or repair of improvements installed on the site.
Replace § 314.1 with "Construction activities authorized under a watershed
management permit must be initiated within 120 days following the date of the
permit issuance. Failure to commence construction activities within those 120
days renders the issued watershed management permit null and void."
Replace § 314.2 with "Construction activities authorized under a watershed
management permit must be completed within 180 days following the date of the
permit issuance."
Replace § 314.3 with "If construction activity has been started but is not
completed within 180 days of the date of issuance of a watershed management
permit and the co- permittee intends to pursue the permitted activity, then the
co-permittee shall submit a written request for an extension. Upon receipt of
such request, either the MWRD or the village may grant an extension for the
construction activities under the watershed management permit".
Article 4 see WMO
Replace § 401.6 with "Portions of the development site where construction
activities have temporarily or permanently ceased, must have stabilization
practices initiated within 1 working day and completed within 14 days except:
   A.   Where precluded by snow cover, erosion control practices shall be
completed as soon as possible; or
   B.   Where construction activity resumes on that portion of the site within
14 days from when the activity ceased."
Article 5 see WMO
Add § 500.8 "In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the co-
permittee shall evaluate and implement, where practicable, site design features
which minimize the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site. The co-
permittee's drainage plan shall adopt one or more of the following strategies
in order of preference. If the strategies with the highest preference are not
adopted, the drainage plan submitted shall include a rationale for not
selecting those strategies with a higher preference.
   A.   Preservation of the natural features of development sites, including
natural storage and infiltration characteristics.
   B.   Preservation of existing natural streams, channels and drainageways.
   C.   Minimization of new impervious surfaces.
   D.   Conveyance of stormwater in open vegetated channels.
   E.   Construction of best management practices (BMPs) that provide both
quantity and quality control with BMPs serving multiple sites being preferable
to those serving individual sites.
   F.   Construction of BMPs that provide only quantity control, with BMPs
serving multiple sites being preferable to those serving individual sites".
Add § 501.4 "Wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be protected
from damaging modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity
associated with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of
this ordinance, the following requirements shall be met for developments whose
drainage flows into wetlands and depressional storage areas as appropriate:
   A.   Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater
detention unless it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality
and the proposed modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability
to perform beneficial functions. Existing storage and release rate
characteristics of wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be
maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet requirements of
this section shall be in addition to this existing storage.
   B.   The existing wetland shall be protected during construction by
appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and shall not be filled.
   C.   Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially decrease
or increase the existing area tributary to the wetland.
   D.   A buffer strip of at least twenty-five feet (25') in width, preferably
vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the
periphery of the wetland."
Replace § 502.12 with "Maximum flow depths on roads for all development shall
not exceed curb heights by more than one (1) inch during the base flood
condition and shall not remain flooded for more than eight (8) hours during the
base flood condition."
Replace § 502.13 with "Maximum detention depths on new parking lots shall be
designed for protection against damages caused by stormwater detention
inundation, which shall not exceed six (6) inches for more than four (4) hours.
The inundation hazard below the 100-year high water elevation shall be clearly
posted."
Add § 503.4 "Infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous
pavement should be located on soils in hydrologic groups "A" or "B" as
designated by the U.S. soil conservation service. Infiltration basins and
trenches designed to recharge groundwater shall not be located within seventy
five feet (75') of a water supply well or a building foundation. A sediment
settling basin may be required to remove coarse sediment from stormwater flows
before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not be
allowed to stand more than seventy two (72) hours over eighty percent (80%) of
a dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated. The
bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet (4') above
the seasonal high water table and bedrock unless otherwise approved by the
enforcement officer"
Replace § 504.3.A with "0.15 cfs/acre of development for the storm event having
a one percent probability of being equaled or exceeded in a given year (100-
year storm event)."
Replace § 504.3.B with "0.04 cfs/acre of development for the storm event having
a fifty percent probability of being equaled or exceeded in a given year (2-
year storm event)."
Add § 504.11.H "Wet detention basins shall be designed so to remove stormwater
pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and, as much as feasible,
to be available for recreational use. Wet basins shall be at least three feet
(3') deep, excluding near shores, banks and safety ledges. If this habitat is
to be provided, it shall be at least ten feet (10') deep over twenty-five
percent (25%) of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out. The side slopes
at the normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than five to one (5:1)
horizontal to vertical. The permanent pool volume at normal depth shall be
equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for a 2-year event. To the extent
possible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized
and, if possible, should be at opposite ends of the basin."
Add § 504.11.I "The use of dry basins within the village is prohibited unless
the village engineer finds and the village board concurs that other detention
methods are inappropriate or ineffective. When so determined, such dry basins
shall be, in addition to the other requirements of this ordinance, designed to
remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and, as
much as feasible, to be available for multiple uses. All detention basin areas
shall be designed to have standing water no longer than seventy two (72) hours
for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Underdrains directed to the
outlet may be used to accomplish this requirement. Velocity dissipation
measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at
inlets and outlets and to minimize the occurrence of suspended solids.
Stilling/sedimentation basins should be constructed at each major inlet. The
volume of the basins should be at least 500 cubic feet per acre of impervious
surface in the drainage area. Side slopes of the basins shall be no steeper
than three to one (3:1) (horizontal to vertical) and basin depths should be at
least three feet (3') to minimize the suspension of accumulated sediment. To
the extent possible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be
maximized and, if possible, should be at opposite ends of the basin. There
should be no low flow bypass between the inlet and the outlet. Paved low flow
channels shall not be used."
Add § 504.11.J "Detention basins shall be designed to protect the safety of any
children or adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events. The
following design criteria in the design of these basins:
      1.   The side slopes of all detention basins at the 100 year capacity
shall be level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and
for stability and ease of maintenance and shall be no steeper than three to one
(3:1) (horizontal to vertical).
      2.   All wet detention basins shall have a safety ledge at least four
feet (4') in width located two and one- half feet (2.5') to three feet (3.0')
below the normal water depth.
      3.   Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be
controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow."
Add § 504.11.K "The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to minimize
and facilitate maintenance. Vegetated side slopes shall be designed to allow
lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins shall be provided
with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the pool for
sediment removal. Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not
feasible. Sedimentation basins shall be included where feasible for localizing
sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment shall be provided."
Replace § 504.12.E with "4 inches or larger in diameter and designed to be
self-cleaning and"
Article 6 see WMO
Replace § 602.9.A with "Equal to at least 1.5 times the volume of flood storage
lost below the BFE."
Replace § 603.9.A and B with "Fifty feet from the boundary of standard isolated
wetlands greater than or equal to one- half (0.50) of an acre in area."
Add § 604.20 "The following development activities may be permitted within
buffer areas only if, as a practical matter, they cannot be located outside the
buffer area. Such development activities will only be approved based upon a
report prepared by a qualified professional which demonstrates that they will
not adversely affect water quality; destroy, damage or disrupt significant
habitat areas; adversely affect drainage and stormwater retention capabilities;
adversely affect flood conveyance and storage; lead to unstable earth
conditions, create erosion hazards, or be materially detrimental to any other
property in the area of the subject property or to the village as a whole,
including the loss of open space or scenic vistas:
   A.   Minor improvements such as walkways, benches, comfort stations,
information displays, directional signs, foot bridges, observation decks and
docks;
   B.   The maintenance, repair, replacement and reconstruction of existing
highways and bridges, electrical transmission and telecommunication lines,
poles and towers;
   C.   The establishment and development of public and private parks and
recreational areas, outdoor education areas, historical natural and scientific
areas, game refuges, fish and wildlife improvement projects, game bird and
animal farms, wildlife preserves and boat launching ramps;
   D.   Limited filling and excavating necessary for the development of boat
launching ramps, swimming beaches, or the development of park shelters or
similar structures is allowed;
   E.   Limited development of roads, parking lots and other impervious
surfaces necessary for permitted uses where no alternate location outside the
buffer area is available;
   F.   Stormwater drainage swales between the developed area of the site
(including a stormwater detention facility on the site) and a stream, lake or
pond, or wetland. Detention basins within the buffer are generally discouraged
unless it can be shown that resultant modifications will not impair water
quality, habitat or flood storage functions;
   G.   Installation of piers for the limited development of walkways and
observation decks. Walkways and observation decks should avoid high quality
wetland areas and should not adversely affect natural areas designated in the
Illinois natural areas inventory or the habitat of rare or endangered species."
Add § 607.12 "Watercourse relocation or modification is not permitted as a
convenience for site design purposes. Under certain circumstances, relocation
and minor modification may be permitted where certain problems can be mitigated
by relocation and/or minor modification, specifically when:
   A.   Off-site hydrologic conditions are causing erosion, flooding and
related problems; or
   B.   On-site soil and geologic conditions are resulting in unstable
conditions that pose hazards to life, health and existing structures or
property; or
   C.   The quality of previously modified or relocated streams can be improved
through restoration; or
   D.   Officially adopted stormwater management plans call for placement of
detention or retention facilities in a stream; or
   E.   Public utilities, including sanitary sewers, pipelines and roadways
require stream crossing or relocation where there are not practical
alternatives."
Add § 607.13 "Stream modification, when permitted, is subject to the following
conditions and restrictions:
   A.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions must be
significantly improved by the modification; no significant habitat area may be
destroyed;
   B.   The amount of flow and velocity of a stream is not to be increased or
decreased as the stream enters or leaves a subject property, unless this
reflects an improvement over previous conditions in terms of reduced flooding,
reduced erosion, or enhanced low-flow conditions.
   C.   Stream channel enlargement or other modifications that would increase
conveyance, shall not be permitted if the intended purpose is to accommodate
development activities in the floodplain."
Add § 607.14 "Armoring in the form of bulkheads, riprap or other materials or
devices is not permitted except in accordance with the following:
   A.   Significant erosion cannot be prevented in any other way and the use of
vegetation and gradual bank slopes has not sufficiently stabilized the
shoreline or bank;
   B.   The bulkhead or other device is not placed within a wetland or between
a wetland and a lake or pond;
   C.   The bulkhead, riprap or other device will minimize the transmittal of
wave energy or currents to other properties; and
   D.   The change in the horizontal or vertical configuration of the land must
be kept to a minimum."
Add § 607.15 "Culverts are not permitted in streams except in accordance with
the following:
   A.   Where a culvert is necessary for creating access to a property. Use of
culverts as a convenience in order to facilitate general site design shall not
be permitted;
   B.   The culvert must allow passage of fish inhabiting the stream and
accommodate the 100 year flood event without increasing upstream flooding
except where a restricting culvert is desirable as part of an overall storm and
floodwater management plan;
   C.   The culvert must be maintained free of debris and sediment to allow
free passage of water and fish."
Add § 601.16 "Impoundments of streams is not permitted except in accordance
with the following:

welfare of the citizens of South Barrington through the regulation of
nonstormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent
practicable as required by federal and state law. This chapter establishes
methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the
national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit process. The
objectives of this chapter are:
   A.   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user;
   B.   To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system;
   C.   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. (Ord. 2011-945, 8-11-2011;
amd. Ord. 0-2015-1060, 3-19-2015)
12-3-7: DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges: No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than stormwater.
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm
drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
      1.   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
groundwater, foundation or footing drains, crawl space pumps, air conditioning
condensation, springs, storm sewer cleaning water, street wash water from
streets where spill or leaks of pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials has
not occurred (unless the pollutants or toxic or hazardous materials have been
removed), routine external building washing that does not use detergents,
noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if clean, nonchlorinated, and pH neutral), firefighting
activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
      2.   Discharges specified in writing by the appropriate jurisdictional
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      3.   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a notification
to the appropriate jurisdictional agency prior to the time of the test.
      4.   The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the federal environmental
protection agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   B.   Prohibition Of Illicit Connections:
      1.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      3.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue. (Ord. 2011-945, 8-11-2011; amd. Ord. 0-2015-1060, 3-19-2015)
12-3-8: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
village of South Barrington may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial
danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the
MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the appropriate jurisdictional agency
may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the
MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   B.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
appropriate jurisdictional agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the appropriate
jurisdictional agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
   C.   Offense Committed: A person commits an offense if the person reinstates
MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior
approval of the appropriate jurisdictional agency. (Ord. 2011-945, 8-11-2011;
amd. Ord. 0-2015-1060, 3-19-2015)
12-3-9: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the village
of South Barrington prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. (Ord. 2011-
945, 8-11-2011; amd. Ord. 0-2015-1060, 3-19-2015)
12-3-10: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.   Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   B.   Access To Facilities:
      1.   The village of South Barrington shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the appropriate
jurisdictional agency.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the village of South Barrington ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.
      3.   The village of South Barrington shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
appropriate jurisdictional agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.   The village of South Barrington has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe,
proper and accurate operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the village of South Barrington and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the village of South Barrington
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit
and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES
permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies the appropriate jurisdictional agency reasonable
access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity
authorized or required by this chapter.
      7.   If the village of South Barrington has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the appropriate jurisdictional agency may
seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2011-945, 8-11-2011; amd. Ord. 0-2015-1060, 3-19-2015)
12-3-11: REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
The village of South Barrington will adopt requirements identifying best
management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility which may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm
drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 2011-945, 8-11-2011; amd. Ord. 0-2015-1060, 3-19-
2015)
12-3-12: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 2011-945, 8-11-2011; amd. Ord. 0-2015-1060,
3-19-2015)
12-3-13: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the appropriate jurisdictional
agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the village of South Barrington within three (3)
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years. (Ord. 2011-945, 8-11-2011; amd. Ord.
0-2015-1060, 3-19-2015)
12-3-14: ENFORCEMENT:

      2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      3.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      4.   The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
      6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If abatement
of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice
shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be
completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to
remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work will be done by
a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall
be charged to the violator. (Ord. 2011-945, 8-11-2011; amd. Ord. 0-2015-1060,

units shall be located on a "lot" as herein defined and in no case shall there
be more than one lot. (Ord. 0-69-105, 5-8-1969)
2-8: HOME OCCUPATIONS:
It is the intent and purpose of this section to allow for those limited uses of
a dwelling unit so located or conducted so that neighboring properties, under
normal circumstances, would not be aware of its existence. The standards as
contained in this section are measured against each proposed home occupation in
order to provide peace, quiet, and domestic tranquility within all residential
neighborhoods within the village, and to guarantee freedom from excessive
noise, excessive traffic, nuisance, fire hazard, and other possible effects of
commercial uses being conducted in residential areas. No home occupation shall
unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring residential
properties or dwelling units. Except where indicated in this section, no
visible evidence of the home occupation shall be apparent from the street or
surrounding area. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit occupants of a
residential unit from enjoying or partaking in hobbies or other activities not
for gain. A home occupation is not deemed a substitute for activities
customarily conducted in commercial districts within the village. This section
seeks to balance the need for certain residents to use their primary place of
residence for limited nonresidential activities while protecting the
neighborhood's residential character and the quality of life for the
residential district's inhabitants.
   A.   Definition: A "home occupation" is a business, profession, occupation
or trade, which is conducted as an economic enterprise by a full time occupant
or occupants of a dwelling unit. The home occupation is incidental and
secondary to the primary use of such residential unit for dwelling purposes and
shall not change or alter the essential residential character of such dwelling
unit or of the neighborhood where the dwelling unit resides.
   B.   Permitted Accessory Use: A home occupation complying with all
requirements and standards of this section and with all other village and state
ordinances, laws and regulations is hereby permitted in the village of South
Barrington residential zoning districts.

   C.   Ground Source Heat Pump Systems (Geothermal System):
      1.   Definitions: The following definitions shall apply to this section:
    CLOSED HORIZONTAL LOOP GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM: A geothermal system that consists
of the following basic elements: underground loops of piping; heat transfer
fluid; a heat pump, and an air distribution system. An opening is made in the
earth. A series of pipes are installed into the opening and connected to a heat
exchange system in the building. The pipes form a "closed loop" and are filled
with a heat transfer fluid. The fluid is circulated through the piping from the
opening into the heat exchanger and back. The system functions in the same
manner as the open loop system except there is no pumping of groundwater. A
horizontal closed loop geothermal system shall be no more than twenty feet
(20') deep.
   CLOSED VERTICAL LOOP GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM: A geothermal system in which a
borehole extends beneath the surface. Pipes are installed with U-bends at the
bottom of the borehole. The pipes are connected to the heat exchanger and heat
transfer fluid is circulated through the pipes.
   GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM: A system for heating and/or cooling buildings using the
earth's thermal properties in conjunction with electricity.
   HEAT TRANSFER FLUID: Any nontoxic liquid, such as food grade antifreeze,
used especially for the purpose of transferring thermal energy from the heat
source to another location.
   OPEN LOOP GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM: A geothermal system in which groundwater is
pumped from a well into a heat exchanger located in a surface building. The
water drawn from the earth is then pumped back into the aquifer through a
different well or in some cases the same well (commonly referred to as
"reinjection"). Alternatively, the groundwater could be discharged to a surface
water body (also known as "pump and dump"). In the heating mode, cooler water
is returned to the earth, while in the cooling mode, warmer water is returned
to the surface water body.
      2.   Open Loop Systems: Open loop systems are prohibited.
      3.   Vertical Closed Loop Systems: Vertical closed loop systems are
limited to a depth no deeper than twenty feet (20') below grade.
      4.   System Testing: Pipes for geothermal systems permitted under this
section shall be tested hydrostatically at one and one-half (11/2) times the
maximum system design pressure, but not less than one hundred (100) psi (689
kPa), for a duration of not less than fifteen (15) minutes. All geothermal
systems must be pressure checked by a licensed geothermal system contractor
every five (5) years from the date of its initial successful test. Results
shall be filed with the Building Officer. If the test results show the system
fails to meet these requirements, system shutdown and repairs shall be made at
the direction of the Building Officer.
      5.   Drilling: Any and all drilling associated with the installation of a
ground source heat pump system shall be performed by a certified geothermal
drill operator.
   D.   Special Uses: Subject to the conditions and requirements of this
section and of section
11-5 of this ordinance other future alternative energy systems may be
considered. (Ord. 2012-973, 9-13-2012; amd. Ord. 2020-1225, 2-13-2020; Ord.

2-13: WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES:
2-13-1: PURPOSE:
The regulations of this section establish regulations for wireless
telecommunication facilities, including freestanding wireless
telecommunications towers and building-mounted and tower-mounted antennas. The
village recognizes the value of wireless telecommunications and the public need
for their safety, convenience and productivity. The village also recognizes the
need to comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No. 104-104
(codified as amended in sections of 2, 5, 15, 17, 18, 20, 28, 42 and 47
U.S.C.)), as amended from time to time, and recognizes that the village zoning
and other regulations may not prohibit or may have the effect of prohibiting
wireless telecommunication facilities within the village and may not
unreasonably discriminate among providers or functionally equivalent services.
However, the village must weigh the public benefit of wireless
telecommunications against the need of the village to protect land uses from
potential adverse impacts including, but not limited to, adverse visual impacts
of wireless telecommunication facilities. The village specifically desires to
keep the erection of new wireless telecommunications towers to a minimum and to
maximize the use of existing wireless telecommunications towers. To that end,
the village encourages new wireless telecommunications antennas to be located
on existing buildings, existing structures or existing wireless
telecommunications towers. Additionally, the village encourages the co-location
of wireless telecommunications antennas whenever possible. (Ord. 2024-1410, 9-

6A-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District in the village is to
encourage a better and more imaginative design of mixed use building forms and
site planning for tracts of land exceeding sixty (60) acres than is possible
under the more conventional zoning regulations. Designation of a Planned Unit
Development District pursuant to the home rule powers of the village of South
Barrington shall promote high quality buildings, architecture, design, and
landscaping that is adapted to the natural features of such sites. Such planned
unit developments shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses and
significant architectural features in the village. The plan commission may
recommend, and the corporate authorities may require, any reasonable condition
or design consideration which will promote proper development in this district.
The following objectives are sought through use of the planned unit development
process:
   A.   To permit maximum choice in the types of environment available to the
public by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the other sections of the village code and/or village zoning
ordinance;
   B.   To promote a creative approach to the use of land and related physical
facilities that results in better design and development, with the inclusion of
aesthetic amenities;
   C.   To combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and
building relationships, including, when appropriate, mixing different
relationships and uses in an innovative design;
   D.   To encourage a pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation,
topographical and geological features, and environmentally appropriate
features;
   E.   To create a method for the permanent preservation of common open space
for the continued use and enjoyment of the residents of the development;
   F.   To provide for more usable and suitably located recreation facilities,
schools, and other public and private facilities;
   G.   To promote the economical use of land and the installation and
maintenance of utilities, street improvements, structures and other facilities;
   H.   To encourage a land use which promotes the public health, safety,
comfort, morals, and welfare; and
   I.   To provide an environment of stable character compatible with
surrounding areas in the village.
The planned unit development is intended to provide for projects in excess of
sixty (60) acres that incorporate a variety of mixed but related uses which are
planned and developed or redeveloped as a unit. The planned unit development
should provide amenities not otherwise required by law and often establishes
facilities and open space greater than the minimum required by law. (Ord. 2000-
597, 3-23-2000; amd. Ord. 2022-1336, 8-11-2022)

administrator with an informal presentation of the proposed planned unit
development. At such presentation the applicant shall provide information as to
the location of the proposed planned unit development, the uses, and
approximate area of use categories, a list of any known exceptions to the
subdivision, zoning and/or other ordinances of the village, and any other
information the applicant deems necessary to clearly explain the proposed
planned unit development. The village administrator may request additional
information or documentation. The purpose of such preapplication presentation
is not intended to provide binding opinions or advice on behalf of the village
to the applicant but to make advice and assistance available to the applicant
before preparation of the preliminary plan, so that the applicant may
determine:
      1.   Whether the proposed planned unit development appears in general to
be in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance and other applicable
ordinances;
      2.   Whether any zoning amendment, special use or other relief is
required in connection with the proposed planned unit development;

goals and policies of the village for development.
The preapplication presentation does not require formal application, fee, or
filing of a planned unit development plat.
   B.   Preliminary Plan Procedures:

to obtain tentative approval and/or commitments from the village that the
plans, design, and program that the applicant intends to build and follow are
acceptable, and that the applicant can reasonably proceed into final detailed
architecture, engineering, surveying, and landscape architecture in
anticipation of final plan approval and subsequent construction. Approval of
the preliminary plan shall not constitute authority to proceed with
construction of any improvements, but rather constitutes an approval of the
general features of the plan as a basis for preparing the final plans. The
preliminary plan shall describe all uses and shall document all infrastructure,
buildings, landscaping, open space, and other improvements for the property.
The corporate authorities shall only approve final plans which substantially
conform to the approved preliminary plan and the ordinances rezoning the
property and authorizing the special uses within the Planned Unit Development
District.
      2.   Procedure:

the village, which shall contain or be accompanied by all required information.
Fifteen (15) copies of all required information shall be submitted. The
application and petition shall be in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter and ordinance. Upon receipt of such application and petition, the
village administrator shall forward same to the corporate authorities with the

corporate authorities should approve the preliminary plan and grant the zoning
requested. The corporate authorities shall refer the application and petition
to the plan commission at a regular or special meeting of the village board
within thirty (30) days of receiving them from the village administrator.
         b.   Fees: The application shall be accompanied by a fee which shall
be established by the corporate authorities from time to time and a signed
agreement that the applicant will pay all reasonable fees incurred by the
village for consulting planners, engineers, or legal review of the proposed
development 1 .
         c.   Public Hearing: Within sixty (60) days of receipt of the petition
and application, and after a determination that they comply with the
requirements of this chapter, the plan commission shall schedule and hold a
public hearing in the manner provided in this ordinance for hearings on the
rezoning of property and the granting of special uses. A record of the
testimony presented at the public hearing shall be made by a court reporter at
the applicant's expense, and maintained by the village as part of its permanent
record concerning the petition and application.
         d.   Findings Of Fact: Following the close of the public hearing on
the preliminary plan and supporting data, the plan commission shall, within
sixty (60) days, submit findings of fact and a written recommendation for
approval, modification, or disapproval, and the reasons therefor, or indicate
why a report cannot be rendered to the corporate authorities at that time. The
report shall set forth in what respects the proposed plan would or would not be
in the public interest and may include findings of fact on the following:
            (1)   In what respects the proposed plan is or is not consistent
with the stated purpose of these planned unit development regulations;
            (2)   The extent to which the proposed plan meets or fails to meet
the requirements and standards of the planned unit development regulations;

does or does not make adequate provision for public services, provide adequate
control over vehicular traffic, provide for and protect designated and common
open space, and further the amenities of light, air, recreation, and visual
enjoyment;
            (4)   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to
the adjacent properties and neighborhood;
            (5)   The desirability of the proposed plan with regard to the
physical development, tax base, and economic well-being of the village;
            (6)   The extent to which the proposed plan will affect property
values in the vicinity.
         e.   Conditions And Guarantees: In connection with the filed petition
and application, the plan commission may recommend, and the corporate
authorities of the village may stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon
the establishment, location, design, layout, height, density, construction,
maintenance, aesthetics, operation, and other elements of the planned unit
development as they deem necessary for the protection of the public interest,
improvement of the development, protection of adjacent areas, and compliance
with this ordinance, the village code, and all existing federal, state, and
local legislation and regulation. In all cases in which the approval of a
petition to rezone and application for approval of a preliminary plan are
subject to such conditions, the corporate authorities of the village may
require such evidence and guarantees as they may deem necessary that the
conditions stipulated in connection with the approval of the petition to rezone
and application for approval of a preliminary plan will be met.
         f.   Determination: After receipt of the aforesaid findings and
recommendations from the plan commission, the corporate authorities of the
village, shall, within sixty (60) days, unless the applicant consents in
writing to an extension of time, either approve the petition for rezoning and
application for approval of a preliminary plan with such modifications,
requirements, or conditions as it may deem necessary, or deny the petition and
application. Failure of the corporate authorities to act within sixty (60) days
without an approved extension of time shall be deemed a denial of the petition
and application. The corporate authorities may approve or deny a petition and
application notwithstanding any contrary recommendations or findings of fact of
the plan commission. A preliminary plan which fails to receive approval of the
plan commission shall not be approved by the corporate authorities except by a
majority of the trustees then holding office. In the case of approval, or
approval with modifications, the corporate authorities shall pass an ordinance
indicating approval of the preliminary plan, rezoning the property, waiving any
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance or the South Barrington Village Code that
are deemed overly burdensome by the Corporate Authorities and granting the
necessary special uses, if any, contingent upon approval of the final plan.
   C.   Final Plan Procedures:
      1.   Final Plan: The final plan shall designate with particularity the
land subdivided into conventional lots as well as the division of other lands,
not so subdivided, into common open space and building sites. The final plan is
intended as a document to be recorded. The final plan shows the exact location
of facilities, while the preliminary plan shows the general location of these
same facilities.
      2.   Procedures:
         a.   Application For Approval Of Final Plans: The final plan, or if
the planned unit development is to be phased, the final plan for the first
phase shall be filed with the village administrator, together with all
supporting data required in subsection 6A-5C of this article, within one year
of the approval of the preliminary plan or within the time frame(s) set forth
in the approved phasing schedule, if greater. Prior to the end of the one year
period or the time frame(s) set forth in the approved phasing schedule, if
greater, the corporate authorities of the village, at their discretion and for
good cause, may extend for up to twelve (12) months the period for filing of
the final plan(s) in whole or for any phase. If the applicant fails to file a
final plan within the aforementioned time period, or any extension thereof, the
corporate authorities of the village, on their motion, may initiate revocation
of the approval of the preliminary plan and/or rezoning of the subject
property. Prior to such revocation and/or rezoning, the village shall provide
written notice to the applicant and the corporate authorities shall conduct a
public hearing at which the applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to be
heard. After such public hearing, the corporate authorities may adopt an
ordinance revoking approval of the preliminary plan and/or rezoning the
property. The final plan and, if the planned unit development is to be phased,
all phased final plans shall substantially conform to the preliminary plan as
approved. The final plan and all phased final plans and supporting data shall
fully comply with the provisions in this ordinance and code, as those
provisions may be modified by ordinance.
         b.   Plan Commission Review: All documents of the final plan shall be
transmitted by the village to the plan commission for review within sixty (60)
days of receipt of the application and supporting materials, and a
determination that they comply with the requirements of this chapter. The plan
commission shall review the final plan for its conformance with the approved
planned unit development preliminary plan and other requirements of this
chapter. The plan commission shall recommend approval or disapproval, and
provide the reasons therefor, to the corporate authorities. The plan commission
shall not make a recommendation on the final plan until it has received written
notice of approval of the final engineering plans by the village engineer.
         c.   Final Engineering Plan Procedures: The final engineering plans
and accompanying documents shall be submitted to the village administrator with
the application for approval of final plan. The village administrator shall
forward the final engineering plans to the village engineer for review and
approval or revision based on all applicable ordinances. The village engineer
shall send written notice to the plan commission, corporate authorities and
village administrator within forty five (45) days of receipt of the final
engineering plans that they have been approved, approved with modifications, or
disapproved.
         d.   Final Action: Provided the final plan substantially complies with
the preliminary plan and satisfies all other requirements of this ordinance,
the corporate authorities of the village, within sixty (60) days of receipt of
the aforesaid findings and recommendations from the plan commission, shall
approve the final plan. If approved, the corporate authorities shall pass an
ordinance approving the final plan or phase thereof.
         e.   Final Plan Recorded: The approved final plan shall be filed with
the appropriate recorder of deeds and all recording costs shall be paid by the
applicant. No permit allowing construction of a building or any other
improvement shall be issued until the final plan is recorded. No final plan
shall be recorded until the final engineering plans have been approved by the
village engineer and the required security for the improvements has been posted
by the developer as set forth in this code. (Ord. 2000-597, 3-23-2000)
   D.   Changes In The Planned Unit Development: The planned unit development
shall be constructed only according to the final plan, approved engineering
plans and specifications, and all supporting data. The final plan and
supporting data, together with all amendments, shall be binding on the
applicants, their administrators, executors, successors, grantees and assigns
and shall limit and control the use of the property (including the internal use
of buildings and structures) and the location of all structures, other
improvements, and open space in the planned unit development as set forth
therein. All proposed changes to the planned unit development after approval of
the final plan must be approved by the corporate authorities of the village and
may be handled as follows:
      1.   Major Changes: Major changes include the following:
         a.   A change in the uses and/or character of the development.
         b.   A change of ten percent (10%) or more in the maximum floor area
ratio for a phase of the development.
         c.   Any increase in the units per acre, total number of units, or
total number of any type of units in the residential areas of a development.
         d.   An increase of ten percent (10%) or more in the units per acre,
total units or total number of any type of units of a phase of the development.
         e.   A reduction in the minimum approved distance between structures
or in periphery setbacks.
         f.   Any increase in the percent of land covered in an entire
development.
         g.   An increase of ten percent (10%) or more in the maximum percent
of land covered in a phase of a development.
         h.   Any change in the height of buildings, street location, open
space plan, subdivision structure, or changes in landscaping that alter the
overall character of the landscaping for the development, or any change in
structures and/or structure locations that increases the total square footage
of all structures approved in the final plan for the development.
         i.   Any material change in the construction phasing schedule or
association agreements, declarations, and other documents.
         j.   Other changes determined to be a major change by the corporate
authorities.
Such modifications may be approved only by submission and reconsideration of a
new preliminary plan and/or final plan and by following the preliminary plan
and/or final plan procedures. If the major change is inconsistent with data or
evidence submitted during the preliminary plan stage, then the resubmission
must begin at the preliminary plan stage unless the change is requested by the
plan commission, village staff, or corporate authorities of the village or the
corporate authorities waive this requirement. If the major change is consistent
with the data and evidence submitted during the preliminary plan stage, then
the resubmission shall begin at the final plan stage.
      2.   Minor Changes: The corporate authorities of the village may, without
public hearing, approve minor changes in the planned unit development. Further,
a minor change is any change not defined as a major change. A minor change
shall include the change of location of any structure in a nonresidential
portion of the development so long as such change of location does not affect
any of the other criteria which would be deemed a major change set forth
herein. Such change shall be reviewed by the village's architectural control
commission prior to its approval by the corporate authority.
      3.   Application: An application for a major change or a minor change may
be submitted by the owner(s) or duly authorized agent(s) of the owner(s) of the
property described in such application. In the event an application for a major
change or minor change is submitted to the corporate authorities for only a
portion of the property within the planned unit development, any notice which
is to be published or other procedure to be followed shall be based solely upon
the legal description of the property which is the subject of the application.
(Ord. 2007-828, 8-9-2007)
   E.   Submission Timing And Reversion Clause: The final plans must be
submitted for approval in accordance with agreed scheduling. The first phase
final plan must be submitted not later than one year from the date of approval
of the preliminary plan or within the time frame(s) set forth in the approved
phasing schedule, if greater. Construction, as authorized by the issuance of a
building permit, must begin within two (2) years of the date of the approval of
the final plan dealing with such construction, or within the time frame(s) set
forth in the approved phasing schedule, if greater. If the developer fails to
comply with these requirements, the corporate authorities may initiate a
revocation of the preliminary plan as hereinabove provided. (Ord. 2000-597, 3-
23-2000; amd. Ord. 2022-1336, 8-11-2022)

The off-street parking and loading provisions of this Ordinance shall apply as
follows:
   A.   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date hereof, accessory parking and loading
facilities shall be provided as required by this Chapter. However, where a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date hereof, and
provided that construction is begun within six (6) months of such effective
date and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities as
required hereinafter need not be provided.
   B.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises shall
be increased through additional dwelling units, gross floor area, seating
capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking or
loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be
provided for such increase in intensity of use. However, no building or
structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established prior to the effective
date hereof shall be required to provide such additional parking or loading
facilities unless and until the aggregate increase in units of measurement
shall equal not less than fifteen percent (15%) of the units of measurement
existing upon the effective date hereof, in which event parking or loading
facilities as required herein shall be provided for the total increase.
   C.   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure which has been
provided with the required number of off-street parking and loading spaces
shall hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
required as provided for such new use. However, if the building or structure
was erected prior to the effective date hereof, additional parking or loading
facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements of the
new use would exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to
the parking and loading provisions of this Ordinance. (Ord. 0-69-105, 5-8-69)

were provided voluntarily after such effective date, shall not hereafter be
reduced below the requirements of this Ordinance for a similar new building or
use.
   B.   Permissive Parking and Loading Facilities: Nothing in this Ordinance
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings; provided,
that all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and
operation of such facilities are adhered to.
   C.   Damage or Destruction: For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date hereof, which
subsequently thereto is damaged or partially destroyed to the extent of less
than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value by fire, collapse, explosion
or other cause, and which is reconstructed, re- established or repaired, off-
street parking or loading facilities need not be provided; except, that parking
or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage
or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in the
event the principal building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means
to more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value, it shall be
necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities as required by
this Ordinance for equivalent new uses or construction.
   D.   Control of Off-Site Parking Facilities: Where required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and shall remain
available for the use of the occupant of the zoning lot for as long as the use
is maintained on said zoning lot. No such off-site parking facilities shall be
authorized and no occupancy permitted where the plans call for parking
facilities other than on the same zoning lot until and unless the Zoning Board
has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and made findings that the
availability of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue and
that the off-street parking facilities will be maintained at all times during
the life of the proposed use or building on the zoning lot.

spaces required by this ordinance results in a requirement of a fractional
space, any fraction of one-half (1/2) or less may be disregarded, while a
fraction in excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one parking space.

the Subject Property cannot be used in a manner consistent with the existing
Zoning. An undue hardship must satisfy each of the following requirements:

property (house and lot).

uses of the neighborhood.

board of trustees which justify the grant.

shall be made in writing in triplicate, and shall contain all the facts
necessary to a consideration of the proposal including a written hardship
