Rules, set forth in divisions (B)(1) through (B)(6) below, that permits its
members to attend any meeting of the City Council (including committee
meetings), as defined in 5 ILCS 120/1.01 et seq., the Open Meetings Act, via
electronic means.
      (1)   Rules statement. It is the decision of the City Council that any
member of the City Council, including the Mayor, may attend any open or closed
meeting of the City Council (including committee meetings) via electronic means
(such as by telephone, video or internet connection); provided that, such
attendance is in compliance with these rules and any applicable laws.
      (2)   Prerequisites. A member of the City Council, including the Mayor,
may attend a meeting electronically if a quorum is physically present
throughout the meeting. In addition, the member should do the following.
         (a)   The member should notify the City Clerk, the City Clerk’s
designee or the City Administrator at least 24 hours before the meeting, unless
impractical, so that necessary communications equipment can be arranged.
Inability to make the necessary technical arrangements will result in denial of
a request for electronic attendance.
         (b)   The member must assert one of the following reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
            1.   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability;
            2.   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the city;
            3.   The member cannot attend because of a family or other
emergency; or
            4.   The member cannot attend because of being out of town.
         (c)   The City Clerk, the City Clerk’s designee or the City
Administrator, after receiving the electronic attendance request, shall inform
the City Council of the request for electronic attendance.
      (3)   Voting procedures. After a roll call establishing that a quorum is
physically present, the presiding officer shall advise the City Council that a
member is going to attend the meeting electronically after specifying the
reason entitling the absent member to attend electronically.
      (4)   Adequate equipment required. The member participating
electronically and other members of the City Council must be able to
communicate effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all
communications at the meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at
any meeting, the city shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish this
objective at the meeting site.
      (5)   Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting. Said
meeting minutes shall reflect and state specifically whether each member is
physically present or present by electronic means.
      (6)   Rights of remote member. A member permitted to attend
electronically will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting
and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present,
subject to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and
adhered to. The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered and
counted as to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending
electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote
counted and recorded by the City Clerk, or the meeting’s recording secretary,
and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member attending
electronically may leave a meeting and return, as in the case of any member;
provided, the member attending electronically shall announce his or her leaving
and returning.
   (C)   This section shall be in full force and effect following its passage
and publication in pamphlet form, as provided by law. These rules are effective

preparing the minutes from any meeting.

upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff

contractor may be declared ineligible for further government contracts or
federally assisted construction contracts.
d.   The contractor will conclude the provisions of this Equal Opportunity
Clause in every subcontract or purchase order, unless exempted by the rules,
regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor so that such provisions will
be binding upon each such subcontractor or vendor.”
      (4)   The city assures that it will actively provide nondiscriminatory
outreach, selection, and service to all individuals.
      (5)   Efforts will be made to hire minority individuals for all job
categories so that minority employment in all categories of the work force will

surrounding areas.
      (6)   The city will provide accommodations to the best of its ability for
employees with disabilities, contingent on budget and structural limitations.

   It shall be the public policy of the city to adopt the NIMS concept of
emergency planning and unified command. It shall further be the policy of the
city to train public officials responsible for emergency management.
(Res. passed 10-11-2005)
§ 32.02 CAPITALIZATION THRESHOLDS FOR CAPITAL ASSETS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish capitalization
thresholds for capital assets; to establish responsibility for tracking
controllable items that fall below the capitalization threshold; and, to
provide guidance for future issuance of capital assets policies and procedures.
   (B)   Background. The term capital assets is used to describe assets that
are used in operations and that have initial lives extending beyond a single
reporting period. Capital assets may be either intangible (e.g., easements,
water rights) or tangible (e.g., land, buildings, building improvements,
vehicles, machinery, equipment and infrastructure). It is incumbent upon
public-sector managers to maintain adequate control over all of a government's
resources, including capital assets, to minimize the risk of loss or misuse. As
a practical application of the materiality principle, not all tangible capital-
type items with useful lives extending beyond a single reporting period are
required to be reported in a government's statement of position. Items with
extremely short useful lives (e.g., less than two years) or of small monetary
value are properly reported as an “expense” or “expenditure” in the period in
which they are acquired. When outlays for capital-type items are, in fact,
reported on the statement of position, they are said to be capitalized. The
monetary criterion used to determine whether a given capital asset should be
reported on the balance sheet is known as the capitalization threshold. A
government may establish a single capitalization threshold for all of its
capital assets, or it may establish different capitalization thresholds for
different classes of capital assets. Capitalization is, of its nature,
primarily a financial reporting issue. That is, a government's principal
concern in establishing specific capitalization thresholds ought to be the
anticipated information needs of the users of the government's external
financial reports. While it is essential to maintain control over all
potentially capitalizable items, there exist much more efficient means than
capitalization for accomplishing this objective in the case of a government's
smaller tangible capital type items. Furthermore, practice has demonstrated
that capital asset management systems that attempt to incorporate data on
numerous smaller items are often costly and difficult to maintain and operate.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BUILDINGS. A capital asset class that includes all buildings that are
owned by the city. Components of a building, not normally replaced, are
considered part of the building. This class also includes building improvements
such as subsequent additions of a new wing or extension, and also structural
renovations and improvements.
      CAPITAL ASSET. Tangible or intangible assets that meet all three of the
following: (1) it must have an initial useful like that extends beyond a single
reporting period, i.e., one year; (2) it must be used in the operations of the
entity, (3) it must not be specifically excluded by policy, e.g.,
capitalization threshold.
      CAPITALIZATION THRESHOLD. The dollar value at which a government elects
to capitalize its capital assets for financial reporting.
      CAPITALIZE. To report capital outlays as capital assets in the statement
of net assets or balance sheets.
      CONTROLLABLE ITEMS. Items that may require tracking due to one or more of
the following: (1) ensure legal compliance, (2) to protect public safety and
avoid potential liability, e.g. weapons; or (3) to reduce risk of loss.
      FAIR (MARKET) VALUE. Estimated dollar amount at which an asset may
exchange between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under
compulsion, each having reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts, and with
equity to both. “Estimated fair value” at acquisition may be obtained from
manufacturers' catalogs or price quotes in periodicals, from objective
appraisals, or similar sources. Estimated fair values is used in valuing
donations.
      HISTORICAL COST. The original cost of an asset at the time of acquisition
including all ancillary charges (e.g., freight, installation, site preparation,
etc.) to bring the capital asset to its intended location and to get it ready
for its intended use.

and that
have useful lives that can be preserved over a longer period than most capital
assets.
      LAND and LAND RIGHTS. The capital asset class which includes all land and

simple or land rights may be purchased without the transfer of title. The
latter may include regular easements, road right-of-way, conservation
easements, development rights, etc.
      MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. The class of capital assets which generally
includes all movable personal property but also includes plant and other fixed
equipment.
      SYSTEM SOFTWARE. Includes purchased special application software. This
does not include general software applications that are needed for basic
computer applications or performing routine office tasks, the cost of which are
normally bundled with the hardware cost or expensed.
   (D)   Policies.
      (1)   (a)   Capitalization thresholds for applicable capital asset
classes are established as follows:
            1.   Machinery and equipment:         $ 2,500.
            2.   System software:            $ 2,500.
            3.   Buildings and building improvements:   $ 2,500.
            4.   Improvements other than buildings:      $ 2,500.
         (b)   The threshold amounts are to be applied to the historical cost
of capital assets at the time of acquisition. Acquisition includes direct
purchase, construction, donation or contribution, capital lease, or any other
means by which rights or title to property transfer to the city. Land and
governmental infrastructure are not subject to capitalization thresholds.
      (2)   The capitalization thresholds are generally applied to individual
items (per unit basis) and not to the total cost of grouped or combined
acquisitions.
      (3)   The change in capitalization threshold shall be applied to the
cities existing capital assets inventory retrospectively. All capital assets
having cost or assigned values that fall below the corresponding thresholds
shall be removed from the capital asset inventory and the general ledger. All
“controllable” equipment that falls below the threshold shall be moved to a
non-capital inventory for alternative tracking.
      (4)   Adequate controls must still be maintained for non-capitalized but
“controllable” items of personal property.
   (E)   Effective date. The effective date for capitalization thresholds for
capital assets is 7-21-2014.

   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not

local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application, but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local Tax
Administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local Tax
Administrator, whichever is longer.

reading.
   (B)   Billing. Water bills will be mailed to the customers the first of each
month.

that balance must be paid before any customer, whether renter or buying on
contract, can receive water service at any location. That customer, in addition
to paying the outstanding bill, will be required to pay an $80 deposit again to
have the bill placed in his, her or their name.

foundation may qualify for a sewer adjustment. The average usage for the past
six months will be charged.

      (2)   $950 for a five-eighths inch meter outside the city limits; and
      (3)   Any meter in excess of five-eighths inch shall be $750 or $950,
plus cost of meter.
      (4)   Service pipe installations. If the water service must cross a city

shall have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in
person and by counsel or any other person of his or her choosing and may
present orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the city
official in charge of utility billing. This official shall be authorized to
order that the customer's service not be discontinued and shall have the
authority to make a final determination of the customer's complaint.
      (2)   Requests for delays or waiver of payment will not be entertained;
only questions of proper and correct billing will be considered. In the absence
of payment of the bill rendered or resort to the hearing procedure provided
herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.

the rear of another building located on an interior lot, the house sewer from
the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one house sewer.
      (3)   Where a public sewer is accessible in a street or alley to a
building or premises abutting thereon the liquid wastes from any plumbing
system in said building shall discharge into the public sewer unless otherwise
authorized by the governing body.
      (4)   Before any connection is made to the public sewer, an approved
permit for such connection must be obtained from the governing body or its
designated representative. Each connection shall be made at the “Y” designated
for that property. The only exception shall be where the designator “Y” is not
located within three feet of the point of measurement furnished by the local
governing body. Any connection not made at the designated “Y” in the main sewer
shall be made under the direct supervision of the Sewer Inspector. A “Y” or “T”
fitting shall be installed near the building foundation to provide for cleaning
purposes.
   (C)   A Sewer Inspector shall be appointed pursuant to the laws of the city

WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 54.20 BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied
by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge
for operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge and a
surcharge, if applicable.
   (B)   The monthly debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the
annual debt service of all outstanding bonds by 12 and further dividing by the
number of gallons billed for that month arriving at a charge per gallon billed.
   (C)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
concentrations:
      (1)   A five-day 20°C BOD of 240 mg/l; and
      (2)   A SS content of 240 mg/l.
   (D)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs, plus replacement
and shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories;
      (2)   Proportion the estimated costs to the wastewater facility
categories by 40% of cost attributed to volume, 30% attributed to suspended
solids and 30% attributed to BOD;
      (3)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated;
      (4)   Proportion the estimated costs to non-industrial and industrial
users by volume, suspended solids and BOD;
      (5)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength; and
      (6)   Compute surcharge costs per 1,000 gallons per mg/l in excess of
normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
   (E)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal
concentrations for BOD (240 mg/l) and SS (240 mg/l). The surcharge will be
based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all
wastes which exceed the 240 mg/l and 240 mg/l concentration for BOD and SS
respectively. Division (F) below specifies the procedure to compute a
surcharge.
   (F)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed
annually by certified public accountants for the city in their annual audit
report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect
a change in debt service or a change in operation and maintenance costs,
including replacement costs.
(Ord. 5, Series 1981-1982, passed 8-24-1981)
§ 54.21 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of
100 gallons.
   (A)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a type
approved by the city for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
   (B)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the city if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
   (C)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled,
without the consent of the city.
(Ord. 5, Series 1981-1982, passed 8-24-1981)
§ 54.22 BASIC USER RATE.
   (A)    A basic user rate of $4.50 per 1,000 gallons shall be applied to all
users for sewer usage in excess of 1,000 per month. A minimum charge of $4.50
per month shall be applied to all users whose sewer usage does not exceed 1,000
gallons per month. All non-metered residential users of the wastewater
facilities shall pay a minimum flat rate charge per month adequate to cover the
costs of the minimum service charge and the basic user rate of $9.00. The flat
rate charge will allow a maximum of 4,500 gallons per month. In the event use
of the wastewater facilities is determined by the city to be in excess of 4,500
gallons per month, the city may require such flat rate user to install metering
devices on the water supply or sewer main to measure the amount of service
supplied.
   (B)   The rates and service changes established for user charges in § 54.20

   Examples:
      In 2023, a metered user using 3,500 gallons per month will be charged
$5.25/1,000 gallons x 3,500 gallons + $10 = $28.38 per month.
      In 2024, a non-metered user will be charged $24 + $15 = $39 per month.
      In 2026, a metered user using 4,930 gallons per month will be charged
$5.25/1,000 gallons x 4,930 gallons + $25 = $50.88 per month.

driving past the yield right-of-way sign, such collision or interference shall
be deemed prima facie evidence of the driver’s failure to yield right-of-way.

violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the return of the motor
vehicle and/or any cash bond posted and towing and storage fees paid.

be limited to, the costs associated with an administrative adjudication
proceeding or court proceeding, and reasonable attorney's fees.
   (C)   If a penalty is imposed pursuant to this chapter, such penalty shall
constitute a debt due and owing to the city. The owner of record's obligation
to pay such debt to the city shall be independent of the city's return of any
impounded motor vehicle. If a bond has been posted, the hearing officer shall
enter an order deducting any fines and fees imposed pursuant to this chapter
from the bond so posted.
   (D)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an impounded motor
vehicle shall be returned to the owner, or other person who is legally entitled
to possess the motor vehicle, upon his or her payment to the city of the
penalty or penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter, including the towing and
storage fees, unless the motor vehicle has been sold or otherwise disposed of
to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever a
person with a lien of record against a motor vehicle impounded under this
chapter has commenced foreclosure or repossession proceedings, possession of
the motor vehicle shall be given to that person, but only upon agreeing, in

We, the undersigned                                                                                    owners of the real estate shown and described herein, do hereby certify that we have laid off, platted
and subdivided, and do hereby lay off, plat and subdivide, said real estate in accordance with the attached plat.
 
This subdivision shall be known and designated as                                                                                . All streets and alleys shown and not heretofore dedicated, are hereby
dedicated to the public.
 
Front and side yard building setback lines are hereby established as shown on this plat, between which lines and the property lines of the street, there shall be erected or maintained no building or

There are strips of ground                       feet in width as shown on this plat and marked “Easement”, reserved for the use of public utilities for the installation of water and sewer mains, surface

at all times to the proper authorities and to the easements herein reserved. No permanent or other structures are to be erected or maintained upon said strips of land, but owners of lots in this subdivision

§ 154.05 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally. Where the subdivider can show that a provision of these
regulations would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to and where,
in the opinion of the City Council, because of topographical or other
conditions peculiar to the site, a departure may be made without destroying the
intent of such provision, the City Council may authorize a variance.
   (B)   Application and determination. In the event that the City Council
finds that extraordinary hardship or injustice will result from strict
compliance with these regulations, it may vary the terms thereof to the extent
necessary to grant relief provided:
      (1)   The special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the tract or tracts to be subdivided;
      (2)   The literal interpretation of the provisions of these regulations
would deprive the subdivider of rights commonly enjoyed by other subdividers
under the terms of these regulations;
      (3)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the subdivider;
      (4)   Granting the variance requested will not confer on the subdivider
any special privilege that is denied by these regulations to other subdividers;
and
      (5)   The City Council determines that the variance requested is:
         (a)   The least deviation from these regulations which will mitigate
the hardship;
         (b)   Not detrimental to the public interest, and is in keeping with
the general intent and purpose of these regulations; and
         (c)   Not applicable to other subdivisions, nor subdividers.
   (C)   Decision. The granting of any variance by the City Council shall be in
the form of a motion which has been presented, adopted, approved and recorded
in the same manner as other motions acted upon by the City Council.
