or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect

required to be competitively bid if the total purchase price is more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and less than twenty thousand dollars
($20,000.00), unless the purchasing agent recommends use of formal bidding
procedures due to project complexity, funding source requirement, or to ensure
that the village is receiving the best price or value.
         c.   Formal bidding procedures are specified in subsection G2 of this
section and shall be followed by the purchasing agent or his/her designee.
         d.   The purchasing agent may make cooperative purchases without
competitive bidding if the purchasing agent determines the purchase being made
after competitive bidding by the cooperative entity is at a price more
advantageous than the village would be likely to obtain by competitive bidding
on its own.
         e.   The purchasing agent may waive the requirements for competitive
bidding in cases of emergency or when the purchase is inappropriate for
competitive bidding due to the nature of the item, time constraints, or other
factors; provided, that the purchasing agent shall file a statement of the
reason(s) for waiving competitive bidding.
      2.   Formal Bidding; Over Twenty Thousand Dollars: The procedure for
formal bidding (over $20,000.00) shall be as follows:

subject to the conditions set forth in subsection H of this section.

underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which
case, the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax

chapter. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-5: ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY:
The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are
minimum standards; therefore this chapter does not intend nor imply that
compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination,
pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-6: DISCHARGE, CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges:
      1.   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the storm
drainage system or watercourses any materials, including, but not limited to,
pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a
violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater.
      2.   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to
the storm drainage system is prohibited except as described as follows:
         a.   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated, typically less than 1 ppm chlorine),
firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants.
         b.   Discharges specified in writing by the director as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
         c.   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the director prior to the time of the test.
         d.   The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the federal environmental
protection agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   B.   Prohibition Of Illicit Connections:
      1.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drainage system is prohibited.
      2.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      3.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the storm drainage system, or allows
such a connection to continue. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-7: SUSPENSION OF ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
village may, without prior notice, suspend discharge access to the storm
drainage system for a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the storm drainage system or waters of the United States. If the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized
enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the storm drainage system or waters of the United States, or
to minimize danger to persons.
   B.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the storm drainage system in violation of this chapter may have
their storm drainage system access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The director will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its storm drainage system access. The violator may
petition the village for a reconsideration and hearing.
   C.   Offense Of Unauthorized Reconnection: A person commits an offense if
the person reinstates storm drainage system access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the director. (Ord.
2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-8: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the village
prior to the allowing of discharges to the storm drainage system. (Ord. 2017-
1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-9: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.   Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   B.   Access To Facilities:
      1.   The director shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures
in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the village.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the director ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      3.   The director shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the director to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
      4.   The director has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the director and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A
person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person
denies the director reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      7.   If the director has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from any
court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-10: REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
The village will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for
any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.
The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 2017-
1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-11: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-12: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drainage system, or waters of the U.S.,
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to director within three (3) business days of the
phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least three (3) years. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-13: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Whenever the director finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the director may order compliance
by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may
require, without limitation:

contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; and
      5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
      6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   B.   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-14: APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the
director to the village board. The notice of appeal must be received within
fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the
appeal before the village board or a hearing officer appointed by the president
of the village shall take place within thirty (30) days from the date of
receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the village board shall be
final. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-15: ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL:
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth
in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within fifteen (15)
days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of the
authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or
restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or
person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency
or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth
above. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-16: COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION:
Within fifteen (15) days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the
property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative
costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of
the assessment within fifteen (15) days. If the amount due is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by
the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become
a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable
to the city by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not
more than twelve (12) equal payments. Interest at the rate of ten percent (10%)
per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the first day following
discovery of the violation. (Ord. 2017-1504, 4-4-2017)
5-7-17: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the authorized enforcement
agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the
person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the
person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation. (Ord. 2017-1504,
4-4-2017)
5-7-18: COMPENSATORY ACTION:

the next supervisor that is on duty of the seizure and impoundment and the

its release.
   C.   When practical, the officer shall allow the removal of personal
property from the vehicle prior to towing if the property is not needed for
evidence, subject to forfeiture or otherwise needed to be maintained by the
police. Officers generally will not wait at the scene of any seizure to allow

property. Persons under arrest will generally not be allowed to remove property
prior to their release.
   D.   Prepare a written police report, notice of seizure (when immediately
deliverable) and tow report, when practical, prior to ending his or her shift.
The preparation of the police report allows for the conduct of a preliminary

other reason. (Ord. 2008-1303, 10-7-2008)

fact of the vehicle's seizure and of the vehicle owner's right to request a
preliminary hearing as provided in this section
7-5-1. When no person is present to receive said notification, officers shall
make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner of record.
   B.   Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant
to this section
7-5-1, the village shall notify, by certified mail, return receipt requested,
the owner of record at his or her last known address, as indicated by the
vehicle's registration, of his or her right to request a final hearing before
the hearing officer that will be conducted to determine whether the subject
vehicle is eligible for impoundment pursuant to this section
7-5-1. However, no such notice need be sent to the owner of record if the owner
is personally served with the notice within ten (10) days after the vehicle is
impounded and the owner acknowledges receipt of the notice in writing.

that may be imposed if no hearing is requested, including that a vehicle not
released by payment of the penalty, fees and remaining towing/storage fees may

7-5-1 has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be
given to the person or agent for said entity with a valid lien, to refund to
the village the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts
necessary to pay all lienholders of record, up to the total amount of penalties
and fees imposed under this chapter.
   C.   If a person entitled to lawful possession does not redeem the impounded
vehicle within thirty (30) days after the vehicle is impounded or after the
hearing officer's written determination, whichever is later, then such vehicle
shall be disposed of in accordance with the procedure set forth for disposal of

   B.   Goals: The goals of this chapter are to: 1) protect residential areas
and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; 2)
encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas; 3) minimize the total
number of towers throughout the community; 4) strongly encourage the joint use
of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single use towers; 5) encourage users of towers and antennas to
locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal; 6) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure
them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative
camouflaging techniques; 7) enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly,
effectively, and efficiently; 8) consider the public health and safety of
communication towers; and 9) avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from
tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. (Ord.

shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and
landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
      3.   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
   E.   Lighting: Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by

for consideration of special use permit applications pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter, the village board of trustees shall consider the following
factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although said
board of trustees may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or
more of these criteria if said board of trustees concludes that the goals of
this chapter are better served thereby:
         a.   Height of the proposed tower;
         b.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
         c.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
         d.   Surrounding topography;
         e.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
         f.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
         g.   Proposed ingress and egress; and
         h.   Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or
alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in subsection B3 of this section.

Alternative Technology: No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant
demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the village board of trustees
that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not
require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's
proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by the
village board of trustees related to the availability of suitable existing
towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to
demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the
following:
         a.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
         b.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
         c.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.

interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
         e.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner
in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower
or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable.
         f.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
         g.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low powered transmitters/receivers attached to a
wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
      4.   Setbacks: The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a special use permit is required; provided, however, that the
village board of trustees may reduce the standard setback requirements if the
goals of this chapter would be better served thereby:

the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      2.   Completeness Of Application: Within thirty (30) days after receiving
an application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village.
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice of
incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      3.   Application Process: The Village shall process applications as
follows:
         a.   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same

of a completed application.
However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a
deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in writing of its
intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than one hundred five
(105) days after the submission of a completed application.
The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 120th day after
submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt of the
deemed approved notice by the Village. The receipt of the deemed approved
notice shall not preclude the Village's denial of the permit request within the
time limits as provided under this article.
         d.   The Village shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this article.
If the Village determines that applicable codes, ordinances or regulations that

replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of
the wireless provider.
The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific Code
provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the
documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Village denies an
application.
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village and resubmit
the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of denial is
sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The Village
shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days after the
applicant resubmits the application, or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit a revised application within thirty (30) days of the denial shall
require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the Village's review period.
The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to proceed
with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted
with the resubmitted application.
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited
in the denial. However, this revised application to cure defects, does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different

If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may
remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations
unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facility or the new
or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village codes or any
provision, condition or requirement contained in this article.
If the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of permits
shall be subject to the applicable Village Code provisions or regulations in
effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the Village by personal
delivery at 4901 North Prospect Road, Peoria Heights, Illinois, 61616, by
regular mail postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means,
including electronic mail.
   C.   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such
interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of
Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Location Of Collocation: The wireless provider shall not collocate
small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric
distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone
of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Complying With Codes Or Regulations: The wireless provider shall
comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that
concern public safety.
      6.   Complying With Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply
with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative
utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements
that are set forth in any Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the
Village, comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other
occupiers of the rights-of-way, including location on a historic landmark or in
a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure do not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a special use permit in conformance with procedures, terms and
conditions set forth in title 10, chapter 3 of this Code.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the rights-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses a
wireless provider's request for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on

and limit requirements required by the Village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage limits required by the Village.
As used in this section, "financial ability to self-insure" shall mean having
and maintaining net unrestricted assets of at least one hundred million dollars
($100,000,000.00), as determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting methods consistently applied, while maintaining appropriate loss
reserves for the amount of self-insurance obligations established in this
section and otherwise which are actuarially derived in accordance with accepted
standards of insurance industry and accrued or otherwise funded. (Ord. 2018-
1565, 7-17-2018)
9-5A-7: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this article or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is held or ruled to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this
article that can be given effect without the invalid application or provision,
and each invalid provision or invalid application of this article is severable.

   L.   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps, copies
of state and federal permits, and documentation of compliance for development
activities subject to this chapter;
   M.   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain;
and
   N.   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 2017-1495, 1-17-2017)
9-6-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the code enforcement officer. The code enforcement
officer shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development does
not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   A.   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to

   B.   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the code
enforcement officer shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that is shown by survey elevation to
be below the current base flood elevation is subject to the provisions of this
chapter. In addition, any development located on land shown to be below the
base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a flood source, but not
identified as floodplain on the current flood insurance rate map, is subject to
the provisions of this chapter. Any development located on land that can be
shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and
which has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance
rate map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the provisions
of this chapter.
The code enforcement officer shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate
map identification.
The code enforcement officer shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or
permit not required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The
code enforcement officer shall not issue a permit unless all other federal,
state, and local permits have been obtained. (Ord. 2017-1495, 1-17-2017)

addition to the requirements of sections
9-6-6 and
9-6-7 of this chapter the following standards apply:
      1.   No development in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection elevation unless
such materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and

In addition, the village of Peoria Heights shall notify adjacent communities in
writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration
or relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 2017-1495, 1-17-2017)
9-6-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Peoria Heights zoning
board of appeals for a variance. The Peoria Heights zoning board of appeals
shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its
recommendation to the Peoria Heights board of trustees. The Peoria Heights
board of trustees may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it
deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   A.   Standards For Variance Request: No variance shall be granted unless the
applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   Variances From Provisions: The Peoria Heights zoning board of appeals
shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of
the building protections standards of section 9-6-7 of this chapter that would
lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Historic Structures:
      1.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
 9-6-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
9-6-6 and
9-6-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
         a.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         b.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
   D.   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and
wet floodproofed:
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farmhouses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
section
9-6-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
9-6-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section
9-6-7 of this chapter.
      6.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with subsection
9-6-7B of this chapter.
      7.   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of section
9-6-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      8.   Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction. (Ord. 2017-1495, 1-17-2017)
9-6-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the village of Peoria Heights or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 2017-1495, 1-17-2017)
9-6-13: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the code enforcement officer
or village attorney may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of
this chapter exists. The code enforcement officer or village attorney shall
notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The village of Peoria Heights shall make application to the circuit
court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such
other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this
chapter;
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense;
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      4.   The village of Peoria Heights shall record a notice of violation on
the title of the property.
   B.   The code enforcement officer or village attorney shall inform the owner
that any such violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages
and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
The code enforcement officer or village attorney is authorized to issue an
order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order
shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work
order. The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the Peoria Heights zoning board of appeals. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Peoria Heights zoning
board of appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the village of Peoria Heights from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord.
2017-1495, 1-17-2017)
9-6-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the village of
Peoria Heights to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance
program including ordinance 2010-1329. However, this chapter does not repeal
the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the
program, nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2017-
1495, 1-17-2017)

grounds thereof. The building inspector shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was

   B.   Stay Of Proceedings: An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of

opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.
   C.   Hearing And Determination: The Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable
time for hearing of the appeal and give due written notice thereof to the
parties and decide the same within a reasonable time. The Board may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the use, requirement, decision or
determination as, in its opinion, ought to be made in the premises, but any
decision to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of an
administrative official or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon
which it is required to pass under this title or to effect any variation in
this title, or to recommend any variation or modification to this title to the

of the Board.
   D.   Final Determination Filed; Appeals To Board Of Trustees: A final
determination shall be submitted to the Village Administrator, in writing, not

10-3A-3: JURISDICTION:
   A.   General Requirements: The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide
appeals from any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
building inspector. It shall also hear and decide all matters referred thereto
or upon which it is required to pass under this title. The Board may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify or amend the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed from to the extent and in the manner that
the Board may decide to be fitting and proper in the premises, and to that end,
the Board shall also have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is
taken.
   B.   Variances:
      1.   When a property owner shows that a strict application of the terms
of this title relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or
structures or to the use of land imposes upon him practical difficulties or
particular hardship, then the Board may make such variations of the strict
application of the terms of this title as are in harmony with its general
purpose and intent, when the Board is satisfied, under the evidence heard
before it, that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable
hardship so great as to warrant a variation in the following instances:
         a.   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary of a
district divides a lot in single ownership as shown of record.
         b.   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which
has been destroyed or damaged to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of
its value by fire or act of God or the public enemy, where the Board shall find
some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming
use, and in no case shall such a permit be issued if its primary function is to
continue a monopoly.
         c.   To make a variance, by reason of an exceptional situation,
surroundings or condition of a specific piece of property or by the reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property of
record or by reason of exception topographical conditions, where the strict
application of any provision of this title would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties or particular hardship upon the owner of
such property and amount to a particular confiscation of property, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience to such owner, provided such relief can
be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without
substantially impairing the general purpose and intent of the Comprehensive
Plan, as established by the regulations and provisions contained in this title.
         d.   To interpret the provisions of this title where the street layout
actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the district
map fixing the several districts.
         e.   To waive the parking requirements in the Neighborhood Commercial,
Commercial Business or Industrial Districts whenever the character or use of
the building is such as to make unnecessary the full provisions of parking
facilities or where such regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon
the use of the lot, as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or
convenience.
         f.   To permit a building to be erected, reconstructed, altered or
enlarged so that the building lines will extend beyond the distances specified
in this title into side yards or into front yards; provided, that such
variances may not be granted: 1) unless there is a building in the block which
extends beyond the distance from the front street line specified in this title,
in which case, the building line may be permitted to extend as near to the
front street line as such nonconforming building; or 2) unless the lot is
irregular in shape, topography or size; or 3) unless the street line of the lot
is directly opposite the street line of a lot which is irregular in shape,
topography or size.
         g.   To permit in any district such modifications of the requirements
or the regulations of this title as the Board may deem necessary to secure an
appropriate development of a lot where, adjacent to such lot on two (2) or more
sides, there are buildings that do not conform to the regulations of the
district.
         h.   To allow the following variances in the standards applicable to
fences constructed pursuant to subsection
10-4-7D of this title:
            (1)   The construction of front yard fences.
            (2)   Front yard fences higher than four feet (4') but not greater
than six feet (6').
            (3)   Front yard fences with less than forty percent (40%) open
design.
            (4)   Front yard fences situated between the front lot line and the
nearest line of a structure located on the lot.
            (5)   A reduction in the minimum setback or an increase in height
not to exceed six feet (6') for fences located on corner lots.
            (6)   When considering applications for the foregoing variances
regarding fences, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the standards set
forth at subsections
10-4-7D2c(2) through D2c(5) of this title.
      2.   Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the
Board the power or authority to alter or change the zoning ordinance or the
district map, such power and authority being reserved to the Village Board of
Trustees. The Board of Appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon
the use of the premises benefited by a variance as it may deem necessary. The
Board shall make no such variation, except in a specified case, after an
application for a permit has been made and after duly advertised public hearing
held by the Board as prescribed by statute. The notice of hearing shall contain
the address or location of the property for which the variation or other ruling
by the Board is sought, as well as a brief description of the nature of the
appeal. In order to partially defray the expenses of the public hearing
involving variance, the applicant shall pay the sum of thirty five dollars
($35.00) at the time of the filing of the application for the variance.
 
3. Any applicant for a variation who is dissatisfied with the decision of the
Board of Appeals on his or her application may appeal the decision of the Board
of Appeals to the Village Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees may at any
time within sixty (60) days after receipt of such appeal affirm, reverse or
partially affirm or reverse any decision of the Board of Appeals. Should the
Board of Trustees fail to act on any such appeal within sixty (60) days after
filing of the appeal, the decision of the Board of Appeals shall be deemed to
have been affirmed in its entirety.
 
C. Special Uses: The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear applications for
special uses in accordance with section
10-3-4 of this chapter.
 
D. Planning Commission: The Zoning Board of Appeals shall function as the
Planning Commission of the Village. Any duties assigned under this Code or
other ordinances of the Village to the Planning Commission shall be performed
by the Zoning Board of Appeals. (Ord. 2017-1520, 9-5-2017)

ARTICLE E. I-1 INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
SECTION:
10-8E-1: Purpose
10-8E-2: Permitted Uses
10-8E-3: Special Uses
10-8E-4: Restrictions On Sexually Oriented Adult Uses
10-8E-5: Site Plan Approval
10-8E-6: Conditional Uses
10-8E-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   Generally: It is the purpose of the I-1 industrial district
regulations:
      1.   To protect established residential areas from nearby industrial,
retail and commercial activities which may create offensive noise, vibration,
smoke, dust, odors, heat, glare, fire hazards and other objectionable
influences;
      2.   To protect established residential areas from nearby industrial,
commercial and retail activities which may cause deleterious secondary effects
as more fully set forth in subsection B of this section;
      3.   To protect established residential areas, recognizing the rising
incidence in the abuse of controlled substances, from the resultant damage to
the peace, health and welfare of the citizens of the village; and
      4.   To protect the limited amount of suitable industrial land from
preemption by other uses and thereby to protect and enhance the tax base of the
village. Limiting the location of sexually oriented adult uses and of
facilities established to treat the abuse of, or the psychological or
physiological dependence on, alcohol or controlled substances to the I-
1 industrial district will produce relatively small or fewer adverse secondary
effects on and will promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of
the citizens of the village. (Ord. 2008-1301, 9-2-2008)
   B.   Sexually Oriented Adult Businesses:
      1.   Purpose And Exemptions: It is a purpose of the sexually oriented
adult business regulations set out in this article to regulate sexually
oriented adult businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and
general welfare of the citizens of the village, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult
businesses within the village. The provisions of sexually oriented adult
business regulations have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it
is neither the intent nor the effect of sexually oriented adult business
regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and
exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.
Sexually oriented adult business regulations do not apply to theaters,
performing arts centers, civic centers, and dinner theaters where live dance,
ballet, music, and dramatic performances of serious artistic merit are offered
on a regular basis and in which the predominant business or attraction is not
the offering of entertainment which is intended for the sexual interests or
titillation of customers, and where the establishment is not distinguished by
an emphasis on or the advertising or promotion of nude or seminude
performances. Neither is it the intent nor effect of sexually oriented adult
business regulations to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
      2.   Findings: Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of
sexually oriented adult uses, presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the village, and on findings incorporated in the cases of Village
Of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); Pap's A.M. v.

from the Report Of The Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of
Adult Uses (June 6, 1989, state of Minnesota), the village finds:
         a.   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses,
are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but
not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, illicit sex acts,
potential spread of sexually transmitted diseases, lewdness, public indecency,
illegal drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values,
urban blight, pornographic litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
         b.   The consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of
sexually oriented businesses exacerbates the deleterious secondary effects of
such businesses.
         c.   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm, which the village has a substantial government interest in preventing
and/or abating. (Ord. 2008-1302, 9-2-2008)

knowingly enter or remain present in an adult booth at any time the adult booth
is occupied by another person, unless two (2) or more persons are necessary for
repair or maintenance of the booth.
      3.   It shall be a violation of this subsection for any person to create,
maintain, or permit holes or openings of any kind to exist between adult
booths.

possess, use or distribute any illegal controlled substance on the premises of
a sexually oriented adult use.
      5.   It shall be a violation of this subsection for any person to engage
in any act of sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, lewdness, assignation
or prostitution on the premises of a sexually oriented adult use.
   D.   Inspections: Sexually oriented adult uses shall permit officers or
agents of the Village to inspect, from time to time and at least twice a year,
the portions of the sexually oriented adult use premises where patrons are
permitted for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the specific regulations
of this section, during those times when the sexually oriented business is
occupied by patrons or is open for business. Such inspections shall be made in
a reasonable manner, and shall not include areas of an adult motel which are
currently being rented by a customer for use as a permanent or temporary
habitation.
   E.   Penalties: Any person or entity which shall violate any of the

Zoning Board of Appeals. "Substantial improvement" is defined as any repair,
reconstruction, or addition of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds
ten percent (10%) of the market value of the structure before the improvement
is started. The term should not, however, include such actions taken to comply

listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of
Historic Places. Such site plans shall include all other requirements of
section

The off street parking and loading requirements of this chapter shall apply as
follows:
   A.   All buildings and structures erected and land uses initiated after the

facilities if construction is begun thereon within six (6) months of the
effective date hereof and diligently prosecuted to completion.
   B.   When a building or structure erected prior to or after the effective
date hereof shall undergo any decrease in number of dwelling units, gross floor
area, seating capacity, number of employees, or other unit of measurement
specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities, and further,
when said decrease would result in a requirement for fewer total parking or
loading spaces through application of the provisions of this title thereto,
parking and loading facilities may be reduced accordingly; provided, that
existing parking or loading facilities shall be so decreased only when the
facilities remaining would at least equal or exceed the parking or loading
requirements resulting from application of the provisions of this title to the
entire building or structure as modified.
   C.   When a building or structure shall undergo any increase in the number
of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or other unit of
measurement specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities
and when said increase would result in a requirement for additional total
parking or loading spaces through application of the provisions of this title
thereto, parking and loading facilities shall be increased accordingly so that
the total shall at least equal the parking or loading requirements resulting
from application of the provisions of this title to the entire building or
structure as modified. (Ord. 740, 4-7-1970)

equivalent new construction. (Ord. 740, 4-7-1970)
10-9-5: ADDITIONAL PARKING AND LOADING SPACES:
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the establishment of off street
automobile parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or

partially destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause, shall not be
reconstructed, reestablished or repaired unless off street parking or loading
facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or
destruction shall be restored and continued in operation. However, it shall not
be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of
those required by this chapter for equivalent new construction. (Ord. 740, 4-7-
1970)
10-9-7: LOCATION OF PARKING AND LOADING SPACES:
All required off street parking and loading shall be on the same lot with the
establishment or on an adjacent lot or one across a street therefrom. (Ord.

   A.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied by such use at the effective
date hereof.
   B.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portions of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
hereof.
   C.   If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of one year or more, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified in this title for the district in which such land is
located.

has been delivered as authorized by section 8 of this chapter shall be
terminated in accordance with the terms of such notice. (Ord. 740, 4-7-1970;

10-10-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
Where a lawful structure, other than a sign or billboard, exists at the
effective date hereof that could not be built under the terms of this title by

be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
   A.   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its nonconformity.
   B.   Should such a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more

reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, except in changing the use of
the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a building
which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the effective date
hereof or of an amendment hereto, but no such use shall be extended to occupy
any land outside such building.
   C.   If a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of one year
or more, it shall not be reestablished, unless the nonconforming use was in a
building designed, arranged and intended for such use.
   D.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, on which or in
which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located,
and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   E.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for twelve (12) consecutive months,
the structure, or structures and premises in combination, shall not thereafter
be used, except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it
is located.
   F.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.

plumbing to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the current
replacement value of the building; provided, that the cubical content of the
building as it existed at the effective date hereof or an amendment hereto
shall not be increased.
   B.   Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any village official charged with protecting the public safety, upon
the order of such official. (Ord. 740, 4-7-1970)
10-10-7: DISCONTINUATION AND/OR REMOVAL OF CERTAIN NONCONFORMING USES AND

conducted wholly within and fully enclosed by the structure.
         b.   Any structure formerly utilized in conjunction with a
discontinued automotive use but thereafter devoted to an alternate use as

nonconforming structure as defined by this title shall be subject to the
limitations on enlargement, modification or reconstruction of nonconforming
structures otherwise set forth in this title.
   B.   The Village Board may at any time after identification of a
nonconforming use or nonconforming structure eligible for discontinuation under
the provisions of this section 10-10-7 direct the Village Administrator or such
other person as the Village Board may identify to deliver a notice of
discontinuation to the owner(s) of record of the lot or lots upon which a
nonconforming structure and/or use is located. Any such notice shall identify
the lot or lots subject to the notice, the use to be discontinued, any
structure directed to be removed, the deadline for discontinuation of the use
or removal of the structure and such other information deemed necessary or
useful by the Village Board. The notice of discontinuation shall be served

least one year, the deadline for discontinuation of the nonconforming use shall
be six months after delivery of the notice of discontinuation.
   E.   It shall be unlawful for any person to continue a nonconforming use
identified in a notice of discontinuation after the deadline established in

structure identified in a notice of discontinuation to fail to remove such
nonconforming structure by the deadline established in such notice. (Ord. 2022-

10-11-8: Modification Of Overlay District Plan
10-11-9: Modification Of Boundaries
10-11-10: Termination Of Overlay District
10-11-1: PURPOSE:
An overlay district is intended to provide a regulatory framework that will
facilitate innovative approaches to the development or redevelopment of land.
Adopted overlay district plans applicable within an overlay district may allow
within its boundaries the mixing of uses not ordinarily authorized within
traditional zoning districts, unusual bulk or coverage characteristics, shared
or unusual parking facilities, modified front, side and rear yard regulations,
nontraditional lot sizes and configurations and nontraditional layouts of
public infrastructure including, without limitation, streets, utilities and
parks. (Ord. 2018-1570, 10-16-2018)
10-11-2: MANNER OF CREATION:
The Village Board may in the manner provided by this chapter designate an
overlay district within any one or more of the traditional zoning districts
authorized elsewhere in this title. The boundaries of any overlay district
designated as provided in this chapter shall be shown on the official zoning
map as an overlay with respect to the existing underlying district or districts
with the additional designation of "OD" followed by the number of the ordinance
which designated the overlay district. No overlay district may be designated
without the simultaneous approval of a plan for the overlay district. (Ord.
2018-1570, 10-16-2018)
10-11-3: APPLICATION FOR DESIGNATION:
The Village of Peoria Heights or any other person or entity may apply to the
Zoning Officer for the designation of an overlay district. Any such application
must include:
   A.   The name, address, telephone number and email address of the applicant;
   B.   A legal description of the proposed overlay district;
   C.   The property identification numbers of all parcels located within the
proposed overlay district;
   D.   A proposed overlay district plan having the content hereinafter
specified;
Any application submitted by any person or entity other than the Village must
include the written consent to the proposed designation and plan of at least
one owner of record of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the parcels proposed to be
located within the overlay district and at least two-thirds (2/3) of the total
area of the proposed district. (Ord. 2018-1570, 10-16-2018)
10-11-4: CONTENT OF OVERLAY DISTRICT PLAN:
An overlay district plan may provide for uses, housing types, minimum lot and
yard requirements and setbacks, standards for building height and bulk,
accessory uses, accessory buildings, parking facilities, standards for signs,
and public or private infrastructure within the overlay district which
supersede regulations otherwise applicable within the underlying zoning
district and, where applicable, any standards for the subdivision of land
within the overlay district which are inconsistent with the standards found at
title 11, chapter 1 of this Code. An overlay district plan must include at
least the following components:
   A.   A description of the overall theme or purpose of the proposed overlay
district;
   B.   A detailed recitation of any modifications to zoning regulations or
subdivision standards which would be applicable within the proposed overlay
district;
   C.   A map drawn at a scale of one inch equals one hundred feet or such
other scale as the Zoning Officer may approve showing the following
information:
      1.   The boundary of the proposed overlay district;
      2.   All streets and zoning districts lying outside of but within two
hundred feet (200') of the boundaries of the proposed overlay district;
      3.   All existing or proposed streets located within the boundaries of
the proposed overlay district;
      4.   Major improvements which the applicant proposes to construct within
the proposed overlay district;
      5.   The underlying use districts applicable within the proposed overlay
district.
Except where specifically superseded or modified in the overlay district plan
approved upon the designation of the overlay district, all regulations
applicable within the underlying use district or districts over which the
overlay district is superimposed shall continue to apply as if the overlay
district did not exist. (Ord. 2018-1570, 10-16-2018)
10-11-5: MINIMUM AREA:
An overlay district must have an area of not less than three (3) acres and must
be compact and contiguous. (Ord. 2018-1570, 10-16-2018)
10-11-6: PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF APPLICATION:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an application for designation of
an overlay district shall be considered in accordance with the procedure
established for the amendment of this title found at section
10-3-3 of this title. For purposes of considering an application for
designation of an overlay district, any references in section
10-3-3 of this title to an application or proposal for an amendment shall be
construed as a reference to an application or proposal for designation of an
overlay district. (Ord. 2018-1570, 10-16-2018)
10-11-7: NOTIFICATION OF PROPOSED DESIGNATION OF OVERLAY DISTRICT:
Notice of a public hearing on an application for designation of an overlay
district shall be published in the same manner and on the same schedule as
notices of proposed amendments to this title are published. In addition to the
published notice of hearing on the proposed designation of an overlay district,
if an application for the designation of an overlay district includes one or
more parcels owned by someone other than persons whose written consent to
designation of the overlay district have been submitted with the application
for designation, the applicant must give written notice of the hearing to the
person or persons in whose name general Real Estate Taxes for each such parcel
were or are to be billed as shown on the most recent records maintained by the
Peoria County Clerk. Such written notice shall contain the same information as
the notice published by the Zoning Officer with respect to the proposed overlay
district and shall either be personally served or sent by certified mail/return
receipt requested at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing on the
designation of the district. The applicant shall provide evidence in a form
satisfactory to the Zoning Officer that such notice has been given. (Ord. 2018-
1570, 10-16-2018)
10-11-8: MODIFICATION OF OVERLAY DISTRICT PLAN:
After submission of an application for designation of an overlay district, but
prior to such designation, the Village Board may in its discretion modify the
plan proposed by any applicant. After the designation of an overlay district
