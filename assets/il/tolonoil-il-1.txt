CUSTOMER SERVICE
§ 35.020 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the goal of the village to provide quality, reliable, and
affordable services, while fostering a small-town atmosphere of friendliness
and caring in our community. To these ends, the village’s employees must
embrace the timeless spirit of public service, while constantly seeking new
ways to increase the efficiency of operations. Customer service supports and
enhances the relationships employees have with those they serve. Even brief
interactions are opportunities for good service.
   (B)   The hallmark of a great small village is the knowledge people have of
one another, and the willingness to use that knowledge to make each other’s
lives a little easier. Employees of the village operate a nonprofit service
organization that is vitally important to those who reside, do business, or
visit the village. Each employee has a responsibility to do his or her part to
keep the village a special place.

§ 35.021 FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
   (A)   The following customer service standards have been established as a
guide for employees and as a reminder that the spirit in which employees
discharge their duties is just as important as the work itself.
   (B)   Employees should make every first impression a positive one.
      (1)   First impressions impact every subsequent interaction. Employees
should be aware of their body language and tone of voice from the first moment
of customer contact.
      (2)   Employees should use appropriate phone etiquette and state their
department and name every time they answer the phone.
      (3)   Employees should keep in mind that from the customer’s perspective,
the employee is the village.
      (4)   Employees should always be aware that some customers may have
multiple relationships with various departments and that those relationships
don’t end even though the interaction is complete.
      (5)   Employees should create a welcoming atmosphere through their
actions and words; even when they must bear bad news, they should do so in a
professional, courteous manner.
      (6)   Employees should never lose sight of the fact that they are here to
serve and attend to the needs of their customers, whoever they may be.

§ 35.022 HELP AND INITIATIVE.
   (A)   Every employee is empowered to help.
      (1)   Employees should resolve to fully listen to all concerns when
approached with a question or issue. If the employee is unable to help, he or
she should ensure that the appropriate person provides help. There is very
little employees do that cannot be paused to take the time to help someone or
steer them in the right direction.
      (2)   Employees should know their scope of authority and feel comfortable
operating within it.
   (B)   In order to serve the public well, employees must be prepared to do
so.
      (1)   Current information should be maintained on the phone system,
internet, and in printed materials.
      (2)   Common questions should be anticipated and appropriate materials
should be made readily available.
      (3)   It is the responsibility of every employee to understand their
department’s procedures so that every customer can be assisted promptly.

§ 35.023 PRIDE.
   (A)   Employees should always display a high level of professionalism to
fulfill their roles in the maintenance of the village’s good reputation.
   (B)   Negativity is contagious; employees should strive to remain positive
in all situations.
   (C)   Employees should ensure that their words and actions are supportive of
all village departments in every interaction, whether internal or external.
Employees are all on the same team.
   (D)   Employees should be open to give and receive constructive feedback as
a means to continually improve the organization.

require additional services due to language differences or physical
limitations.

§ 35.026 EMPATHY.
   Empathy is always the best policy.
   (A)   Employees should always try to put themselves in the place of the
person the employee is working with and make their best effort to fully
understand the request or comment.
   (B)   Employees should seek to understand the needs of the person before
seeking to be understood.
   (C)   While employees cannot always do what every customer wants, they can
always treat them with fairness and respect.
(Ord. 17-O-06, passed 3-7-2017; Ord. 2020-O-15, passed 8-18-2020; Ord. 2021-O-

§ 35.027 TIMELINESS.
   People deserve a timely response to their inquiries.
   (A)   As long as it can be done safely and practically, an immediate
response to people’s inquiries is always the ideal.
   (B)   As a service organization, the village must strive to always be aware
of other peoples’ schedules and be willing to accommodate them whenever
possible.
   (C)   When an immediate response is not possible, employees should always
provide a realistic expectation of when a follow-up response from a person
knowledgeable of their situation can be expected.
   (D)   Voicemails and emails should be responded to on the same day they were
received whenever possible. If an employee can’t provide an answer immediately,
she or he should at least tell the person quickly that the employee is working
on a solution to his or her question.

§ 35.028 FOLLOW-UP.
   (A)   Employees should always follow up to make sure the customer’s
situation is resolved.
      (1)   When appropriate, employees should send follow-up letters (or
emails, if that was the format of their request) to customers, with questions
about how their experience with the village could have been better.
      (2)   Before ending any interaction, employees should always be sure that
all of a customer’s needs have been discussed and ensure that all avenues that
the village can realistically provide to resolve the situation at hand have
been addressed.
   (B)   When appropriate, employees should offer suggestions to their
supervisors as to how similar problems could be avoided in the future.

determined as appropriate by the Chief. For all other non-emergency situations,
employees are not authorized to travel beyond the village limits without prior
supervisor approval.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT
§ 35.065 POLICY.
   Language in the village ordinances notwithstanding, all prior existing
sexual harassment policies and/or provisions shall be superseded by this
subchapter.
(Ord. 18-O-1, passed 1-2-2018; Ord. 2020-O-15, passed 8-18-2020; Ord. 2021-O-5,
passed 5-4-2021)
§ 35.066 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The
courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under
Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons
have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations.
   (B)   It is a policy of the village to prohibit harassment of any person by
any municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees, and municipal
agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person,
regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. 18-O-1, passed 1-2-2018; Ord. 2020-O-15, passed 8-18-2020; Ord. 2021-O-5,
passed 5-4-2021)
§ 35.067 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in
the state’s Human Rights Act, being 775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq., which currently
defines SEXUAL HARASSMENT as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy, or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature;
         (b)   Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, catcalls, or smacking or
kissing noises;
         (c)   Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups, or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
         (d)   Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault; and
         (e)   Textual/electronic. Sexting (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking, and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email, text/picture/video messages, internet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages, and social network websites like Facebook
and Twitter).
   (B)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a reasonable person.
(Ord. 18-O-1, passed 1-2-2018; Ord. 2020-O-15, passed 8-18-2020; Ord. 2021-O-5,
passed 5-4-2021)
§ 35.068 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING.
   (A)   (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
himself or herself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating his or
her position to the offending employee, and his or her immediate supervisor.
      (2)   It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the
person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following.
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express his or her objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
         (a)   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a Director of Human Resources, an Ethics
Officer, the Village Manager or Administrator, or the Chief Executive Officer
of the municipality.
         (b)   The employee experiencing what she or he believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality.
         (a)   The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and
effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that
problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all
municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human
Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for
information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities.
         (b)   An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time, and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos, and telephone
messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges, the difficulties associated with their investigation, and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.

§ 35.069 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee, or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation
of this subchapter; or
      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of this subchapter, RETALIATORY ACTION means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
state’s Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state agency, or
other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency, or other state
employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the state’s Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation.
   (F)   According to the state’s Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people, to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that which he or she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the state’s
Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the
alleged retaliation.

§ 35.070 CONSEQUENCES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks,
and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this chapter or
the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65 may be
subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline, or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law, or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.

§ 35.071 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   (A)   A FALSE REPORT is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks, and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
   (B)   (1)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act, being 5 ILCS 430/1-1 et seq. to an ethics commission, an inspector
general, the state police, a State Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other
law enforcement official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
      (2)   An Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine of up to
$5,000 against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous, or bad
faith allegation.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
§ 35.085 COMPENSATION PLAN.
   (A)   The Board is committed to paying competitive wages to its employees
based on the skill required for the position, the experience, and/or longevity
of the individual employee with regard to the position, and ongoing performance
of the employee in the assigned position.
   (B)   (1)   Over the course of employment with the village, an employee may
receive periodic increases in wages based on merit (i.e., performance equal to
or exceeding expectations) and based on seniority.
      (2)   All raises must be approved by the Village Board.
   (C)   Under unusual circumstances, an employee may have her or his wages
reduced. This reduction can occur because of a reassignment to the employee, a
restructuring of the position, or exceedingly poor performance during an
individual evaluation period.
   (D)   It is anticipated that employee evaluations will be completed every
March. Performance bonuses or adjustments to wages may take place following
their evaluation. Raises will take effect on May 1, the beginning of the
village’s fiscal year.

§ 35.087 PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS.
   (A)   There are two categories of payroll deductions:
      (1)   Those required by state and federal law; and
      (2)   Those authorized by the employee.
   (B)   Payroll deductions required by state and federal law include federal
withholding, income tax, social security tax, and wage garnishments as required
by law (e.g., child support payments, court-ordered payments, IRS
garnishments).
   (C)   If authorized in writing by an eligible employee, the village will
also make additional deductions for health insurance and other purposes that
are for his or her benefit. These include payments into savings funds;
retirement contributions; union dues; and voluntary contributions to charities.
Arrangement for these voluntary deductions may be made with the administrative
staff.

§ 35.088 SOCIAL SECURITY (FICA).
   Social security is a payroll deduction representing an employee’s
contribution to the federal government’s social security program. The village
also contributes money on behalf of the employee to the program (with the

§ 35.089 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION INSURANCE.
   The village pays a premium for workers’ compensation insurance for all
employees. This insurance protects employees from a loss of income and pays
medical expenses, resulting from a workplace accident or injury. Employees are
required to report all work-related injuries to their supervisors immediately.

§ 35.091 HEALTH COVERAGE.
   Village provides for full time employees on an annual basis based on funding
available for the village. No additional compensation will be paid to any

§ 35.092 CONTINUATION OF GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE.
   (A)   (1)   The continuation coverage mandated by the federal law commonly
known as COBRA does not apply because the village does not have 20 or more
employees. However, the state currently has what is known as a Mini-COBRA Law,
which allows health insurance benefits to be continued for up to 12 months
after the termination of employment or after an employee suffers a reduction in
hours resulting in a loss of coverage under the group health plan. The premium
for continuation coverage must be paid by the employee, but it may not exceed
the group rate.
      (2)   To be eligible, the employee must have been continuously covered
under the group health plan for three months. Continuation coverage is also
available for spouses and dependents who have been continuously covered under
the group health plan for three months.
   (B)   In addition, the state has a Spousal Law and a Dependent Child Law,
which allow health insurance benefits to be continued for spouses and/or
dependent children following a qualifying event, which may be the retirement,
death, or divorce of an employee, or which may be the age at which coverage is
no longer provided for a dependent under the group health plan. In these
situations, written notice of the qualifying event and a request for
continuation coverage should be given to the village within 30 days of the
event. The village will forward the written notice to the group health
insurance company.

§ 35.093 RETIREMENT IMRF.
   All full-time employees participate in the Illinois Municipal Retirement
Fund (IMRF). Employees’ mandatory contribution of 4.5% from their gross pay
will be deducted from their paychecks. Employees do have the option to take an
additional deduction up to 7%, in addition to the 4.5%. To be fully vested,
employees must be employed with the village for eight years. This is not an
optional deduction.

§ 35.106 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   Eligible employees who record more than 40 hours of hours worked in a
work week may be compensated for the overtime in one of two ways:
      (1)   Overtime pay; or
      (2)   Compensatory time off.
   (B)   It is the expectation that employees will be paid for time worked more
than 40 hours per week unless management decides to allow compensatory time off
based upon budgetary constraints and/or operational needs of the department. As
of the effective date of this chapter, employees may elect to receive
compensatory time off as described in this chapter.

§ 35.107 ELIGIBILITY.
   All permanent employees employed on a full-time basis by the village are
eligible. Part-time employees, seasonal employees, and temporary employees
shall not be covered under this policy.

§ 35.108 COVERAGE.
   (A)   (1)   Employees earn time-and-one-half for all hours worked in excess
of 40 hours in a work week. An employee must actually work over 40 hours to
earn overtime compensation or compensatory time off.
      (2)   Paid time that is not considered work time (i.e., leave or paid
time off) does not count as time worked for the purpose of determining employee
eligibility for overtime or compensatory time off.
   (B)   Working more than eight hours in a work day does not constitute
overtime or require compensatory time off. The additional accrual occurs only
after working more than 40 hours in a work week.
(Ord. 2017-O-15, passed 8-1-2017; Ord. 2020-O-15, passed 8-18-2020; Ord. 2021-

§ 35.109 OVERVIEW.
   (A)   Management reserves the right to determine whether compensatory time
off may be earned in lieu of overtime pay based upon the operational needs of
the department or the village.
   (B)   Compensatory time off is paid time off equal to one and one-half times
the amount of time worked in excess of 40 hours in a work week. For example: an
employee who works 44 hours in a work week would receive the 40 hours of pay
and accrue six hours of compensatory time off (four hours per one and one-
half).
   (C)   (1)   When an employee plans to take compensatory time off, such
compensatory time of must be scheduled in advance and approved by the
supervisor. Every effort should be made to accommodate the preference of the
employee when scheduling compensatory time off unless the requested
compensatory time off will unduly disrupt the department’s operations.
      (2)   Compensatory time off may be used for any purpose, but must be used
prior to the use of vacation leave.

§ 35.110 AMOUNTS.
   The maximum amount of compensatory time off an employee may carry at any
time is 40 hours. Any overtime in excess of the 40-hour maximum cannot be
considered compensatory time off; instead, the overtime must be paid in the
employee’s next paycheck.

be required to complete time sheets and may be required to punch a time clock.
If a time clock is in use, employees may not punch in more than seven minutes
prior to their start time or seven minutes after their end time. Employees who
violate this provision are subject to discipline. No one is authorized to punch
a time clock for another employee. The employee is responsible for the accuracy
of the time records. Falsification of time records could lead to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination from employment. If an employee find
errors in the records, the employee is required to notify his or her
supervisor.

§ 35.129 OVERTIME COMPENSATION.
   (A)   From time to time, it may be necessary for an employee to perform
overtime work. When possible, the President must approve all overtime in
advance. Except in the event of an emergency, the village will attempt to
provide you with advance notice of the necessity for overtime work. Police
Department employees should refer to their collective bargaining unit agreement
to determine their overtime policies.
   (B)   Most non-exempt employees are entitled to be paid one and one-half
times their regular rate of pay for all time worked in excess of 40 hours per
week. Sick days, holidays, vacation time, and other time off benefits are not
counted as time worked for purposes of overtime.

§ 35.130 ATTENDANCE AND TARDINESS.
   (A)   Absence or tardiness places an extra burden on coworkers and
undermines the efficient operations of the village. Good attendance is expected
of every employee. It is each employee’s responsibility to be on the job, on
time each day, and fully able and ready for work. Employees are expected to
arrive at work on time, to return from rest breaks and lunch breaks on time,
and to work until the shift is complete.
   (B)   With the exception of emergency situations, absences from work due to
illness or injury must be reported to the employee’s supervisor within a
minimum of three hours prior to the employee’s assigned work shift. In the
absence of an employee’s supervisor, notice should be given to his or her
designee or the Police Chief. Employees are required to notify their supervisor
at least three hours before each day of a continuing absence, unless the
requested leave is established by a medical professional. Failure to follow
these policies will result in discipline. For non-Police Department employees,
an absence of three consecutive days without notification is considered a
resignation.
   (C)   Absence of more than three consecutive days due to illness or injury
requires a written statement from a medical professional explaining the
absence. The village may also require a statement from a medical professional
whenever absences are excessive. In addition, the village may require the
employee to submit to a physical examination by a medical professional selected
by the village at the village’s expense at anytime illness or injury is
interfering with the employee’s productivity. Note, the collective bargaining
agreement for the Police Department may contain different provisions.

§ 35.131 SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   Sick leave is a benefit and not a right for the employee to use at her
or his discretion. Accumulated sick leave is an employee’s assurance of a
regular continuing income in the event of their personal illness or physical
incapacity, exposure to a contagious disease that would endanger the health of
other employees or our customers, personal illness within his or her immediate
family, disability resulting from pregnancy, childbirth, or other medical
conditions, enforced quarantine in accordance with community health
regulations, or appointment with a licensed medical doctor, dentist, or other
health practitioner.
   (B)   Full-time employees accrue sick leave at the rate of two and one-half
hours per pay period. Part-time employees accrue sick leave based on prorating
the percentage of a full-time work schedule. Leave may be accrued up to 360
hours. Accrued leave may not be used or paid to the employee upon separation of
employment.
   (C)   Employees accruing more than 360 hours may have the excess hours
recorded in a bank which may be used to extend service time for purpose of IMRF
retirement.

§ 35.133 VACATION LEAVE.
   (A)   Full-time employees are entitled to vacation leave based upon length
of service and anniversary date. If there is a break in service, eligibility
for vacation will be based on the employee’s current hire date.
   (B)   Vacations must be schedule with, and approved by, the employee’s
supervisor at least two weeks prior to the commencement of the leave time.
While his or her supervisor will make every effort to accommodate his or her
leave request, work priorities and conflicting leave schedules may prevent
approval of his or her request.
   (C)   (1)   The purpose of vacation leave is to provide employees with a
time to rest and relax. Employees therefore are expected to take vacation leave
during the year the leave was earned. Vacation time shall be accrued monthly
rather than a lump sum on the employee’s anniversary. For example: if an

cause. However, if an employee’s termination is related to employee misconduct,
the village will adhere to the Progressive Discipline Policy in determining if
the employee will be terminated immediately. Either the President may make a
recommendation to the Board, or the Board may, by a majority vote, recommend
that an employee be terminated. If the recommendation is from the President,
the Board must approve the termination. If the termination is recommended by

her discretion.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 36.001 DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE.
   (A)   Post-probationary employees shall be disciplined and/or discharged for
just cause consistent with this agreement. The village agrees that any
disciplinary action shall be taken in a timely fashion. However, with respect
to the scheduling of suspensions, the Police Chief may consider the
availability of other officers to cover the shifts during a disciplinary
suspension of an individual officer, and schedule the suspension so as not to
impede police operations.
   (B)   The village agrees with the tenets of progressive and corrective
discipline. However, serious infractions of departmental rules and regulations,
village ordinances, or state or federal laws may result in more serious
discipline up to and including immediate discharge. Once the measure of
discipline is determined and imposed, the village shall not increase it for the
particular incident of misconduct unless new facts or circumstances become
known.
   (C)   Disciplinary action will include the following:
      (1)   Oral warning or reprimand;
      (2)   Written reprimand;
      (3)   Suspension without pay up to three days;
      (4)   Suspension without pay for more than three days; and
      (5)   Suspension pending ultimate discharge.
   (D)   The village shall comply with the provisions of the state’s Uniform
Peace Officers’ Disciplinary Act, being 50 ILCS 725/1 et seq. in conducting any
formal investigation as defined in the Act.
   (E)   Oral warnings or reprimands may not be grieved. However, notice of the
oral reprimand will be provided to the union and should further disciplinary
action be taken based, in part, on the previous oral reprimand or warning, the
union may dispute the just cause for the oral reprimand or warning in the
process of grieving another level of disciplinary action taken against that
employee. All other forms of discipline may be grieved.
   (F)   All discipline may be grieved. Any oral reprimand shall be removed
from the employee’s record, if, from the date of the last reprimand, 12 months
have passed without the employee receiving an additional oral reprimand or
other discipline for the same or substantially similar offenses. Written
reprimands will remain a part of the officer’s permanent personnel file.
However, when an officer has completed two years without any additional written
reprimand, previous written reprimands will not be considered for purposes of
progressive discipline.

   (E)   The eight hours shall not be considered hours worked for purposes of
calculating overtime.
   (F)   All holiday pay and any overtime resulting from the holiday hours
being considered as hours worked shall be paid in the regular payroll cycle. No
holiday hours can be accumulated or exchanged for any other time off of work.
   (G)   If non-union village employees are granted holidays other than those
listed above, those extra holidays shall be granted to members of the
bargaining unit.

   (B)   Any officer desiring such assistance should submit a written request
to the Police Chief two months prior to the start of the course or training
program. The request must include an explanation of the nature of the course
and a statement indicating what benefits the village will derive from the
employee participation.
   (C)   If assistance is approved, the village may commit to reimburse the
entire or partial tuition costs and/or the cost of books and material as
determined by the Board prior to the employee’s enrollment in the course.
Officers will be reimbursed upon satisfactory completion of the course provided
that the officer receives a grade of C or better if the course is graded and
attends 80% of scheduled classes in any event. Failure to achieve these minimum
standards will result in no reimbursement by the village. Should the officer
leave the employment of the village voluntarily prior to the expiration of two
years following the completion of a course or program funded in whole or in
part by the village, the employee shall repay the village 100% of the
reimbursement within 30 days of separation.

must personally arrange her or his own return transportation.
   (B)   The village will continue to pay Nextel services to full-time police
officers who have Nextel cell phone service in the same amount that is provided

(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.051 NORMAL WORK HOURS.
   (A)   (1)   Regular full-time officers may be assigned to work either four
ten-hour workdays or five eight-hour workdays per work week with two
consecutive days off, with at least one officer scheduled off both Saturday and
Sunday unless work hours are shortened due to budgetary constraints. The senior
officer shall be allowed to retain the current shift and days off assignment
throughout the contract as long as ten-hour shifts are maintained. Other full-
time officers are assigned shifts in advance by the Police Chief for two-month
periods, which assignments can be modified by mutual agreement.
      (2)   Whenever a change in hours is planned, a seniority shift selection
will be used to fill the schedule. However, if work hours are reduced due to
budgetary constraints, a full-time employee may be offered part-time work. In
that instance, the affected employee will be given as many work opportunities
as are available with one day off per week, before hours are offered to other
part-time officers. If the formerly full-time employee regularly works 30 or
more hours per week, the employee will still be considered full- time for
purposes of benefits granted under this agreement.
      (3)   Paid meal periods of 30 minutes and two break periods of 15 minutes
may be taken as time allows per shift. However, these breaks may not be taken
consecutively and the Chief may prohibit two on duty officers from taking lunch
and breaks together. Officers shall be available for duty during any lunch and
break periods. The village retains the ability to initiate a time clock system
under management rights.
   (B)   If work hours are reduced due to budgetary constraints, full-time
officer hours will not be reduced below 40 hours per week if any hours are
being worked by part-time officers, unless a full-time officer requests time
off.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.052 OVERTIME.
   (A)   (1)   Every officer covered by this agreement shall be paid at the
rate of one and one-half of his or her regular hourly rate of pay for all hours
worked in excess of 40 hours within a work week (Thursday through Wednesday).
Any full-time officer who wishes to be considered for extra work assignments
for a given month must provide the dates and hours of availability to the Chief
prior to the twentieth day of the preceding month. Extra work assignments will
then be offered to full-time officers when no bargaining unit part-time
officers are available to work on a rotating basis if/when more than one full-
time officer is available for a given work assignment. In instances of two
officers requesting the same overtime assignment, seniority will prevail on
rotating basis. (Note: The term “extra work” does not include hours worked by
any part-time officers working less than 40 hours in a given week.)
      (2)   The Chief may schedule part-time officers to work any hours which
do not constitute an overtime assignment.
   (B)   For unplanned overtime, i.e., overtime which is not known to be
available until three days prior to the assignment, every attempt will be made
to distribute the overtime fairly and equitably to bargaining unit members.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.053 CALL BACK.
   Any officer covered by this chapter who is called back to work an assignment

shall be compensated a minimum of two hours for each call back or the actual
time worked, whichever amount is greater. Calculation of actual time worked
will begin when an officer reports ready for duty.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.054 HOURS WORKED.
   HOURS WORKED as used herein shall include all hours actually worked and

a minimum of two hours or the actual time worked, whichever is greater.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.056 SHIFT EXCHANGES.
   Upon no less than 48 hours’ written notice to the Police Chief of an
exchange of work shifts, between any officers, and if and only if the exchange
of working hours does not create additional overtime payment, the exchange of
work shifts shall be allowed.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.057 COMPENSATORY TIME.
   All overtime shall be paid in the officer’s next paycheck. There shall be no
provision for compensatory time, i.e., time granted off during a subsequent pay
period in lieu of overtime, either at the village’s request or the employee’s
request. Work time exchanges within a pay period are only allowed if the
village and affected officers all agree.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.058 NO GUARANTEE.
   Full-time employees are guaranteed 40 hours per week for the term of this
agreement, except as provided in § 36.051. However, any reduction in work hours
shall be made with as much reasonable notice as possible.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.059 GROUP INSURANCE.
   (A)   Provision of insurance. The village shall provide bargaining unit
employees with individual group comprehensive medical coverage. No additional
compensation shall be paid to any employee who refuses health insurance
coverage.
   (B)   Benefits and cost sharing. The village shall provide, for the term of
this chapter, the foregoing coverage at substantially the same level of
benefits and effect on the execution of this agreement.
   (C)   Group life insurance. If the village provides group life insurance for
the general non-bargaining unit employees of the village, it shall provide
bargaining unit employees with group life insurance at the same level of
benefits and with the same premium contribution requirements as provided for
the general non-bargaining unit employees of the village.

the officer is entitled to seniority or not. The village shall post a similar
list without officers’ addresses.

notify the village of any alleged errors in the list or it will be considered
binding on the officer and the union. When changes or additions to those lists
become necessary, the village will provide notification to the union of such
changes or additions and a revised seniority list will be posted.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
§ 36.085 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition applies unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   GRIEVANCE. Any disagreement between the union or an employee and the village
over the interpretation or application of any provisions of this agreement.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.086 GRIEVANCE STEPS.
   (A)   The parties acknowledge that it is usually most desirable for an
officer and his or her immediate supervisor to resolve problems through free
and informal communications. If, however, the informal process does not resolve
the matter, the grievance will be processed as follows.
      (1)   Step 1: Chief of Police. If the grievance is not settled in the
informal process and the employee wishes to appeal the grievance, it shall be
submitted in writing to the Police Chief within five business days after
receipt of the answer of the informal process. A grievance relating to all or a
substantial number of employees or the union’s own interests or rights with the
employer may be initiated at Step 1 by a union representative. The Police
Chief, or his or her designee, shall investigate the grievance and, in the
course of such investigation, shall offer to discuss the grievance within five
business days with the grievant and an authorized representative of the union
at a time mutually agreeable to the parties. The Police Chief or his or her
designee shall provide a written answer to the grievant and the union within
five business days following their meeting.
      (2)   Step 2: Mayor. If the grievance is not settled at Step 1, and the
employee or the union wishes to appeal the grievance to Step 2, it shall be
submitted in writing to the Village Clerk within five business days after
receipt of the Chief’s answer to Step 1. Thereafter, the Mayor or her or his
designee shall meet with the grievant and a union representative within 15
business days of receipt of the appeal. The Mayor or her or his designee shall
submit a written answer to the grievant and the union within ten business days
following the meeting.
      (3)   Step 3: Arbitration. If the grievance is not settled in Step 2 and
the union wishes to appeal the grievance, the union may refer the grievance to
arbitration as described below, within 15 business days of receipt of the
village’s answer provided to the union at Step 2.
   (B)   In the absence of agreement on the selection of a neutral arbitrator,
the parties shall file a joint request with the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service (FMCS) for a panel of seven arbitrators from which the
parties shall select a neutral arbitrator. The parties shall agree to request
the FMCS to limit the panel to members of the National Academy of Arbitrators
and to those residing within 100 miles of the village. Both the village and the
union shall have the right to reject one panel in its entirety within seven
business days of its receipt and request that a new panel be submitted. The
village and union shall alternately strike names from the panel. The order of
striking names shall be determined by a coin toss with the losing party
striking the first, third, and fifth names. The remaining person shall be the
arbitrator.
   (C)   The arbitrator shall be notified of her or his selection and shall be
requested to set a date for the hearing, subject to the availability of union
and village representatives. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the
cost of a written transcript for the arbitrator shall be divided equally
between the village and the union; provided, however, that each party shall be
responsible for compensating its own representative and witnesses.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.087 LIMITATIONS ON AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATORS.
   (A)   The power of the arbitrator shall be limited to the interpretation and
application of the written provisions of this agreement. In no event may the
terms and provisions of the agreement be deleted, modified, or amended by the
arbitrator. He or she shall consider and decide only the specific issue(s)
raised by the grievance as submitted to the village at Step 1 or Step 2, and
shall have no authority to make his or her decision on any issue not so
submitted to him or her. The arbitrator shall submit his or her written
decision within 30 calendar days following the close of the hearing or
submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties
agree to an extension. In the event the arbitrator finds a violation of the
agreement, he or she shall determine an appropriate remedy.
   (B)   The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the
parties.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.088 MISCELLANEOUS.
   (A)   A BUSINESS DAY is a calendar day exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, or
holidays observed by the village.
   (B)   No grievance may be filed more than 20 business days from the day of
the original occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance, except that
for errors in pay, the time period shall be 25 business days. No grievance
filed after said time limit shall be processed. The failure of an employee to
act within the time limits will act as a bar to any further appeal.
   (C)   If a decision is not appealed by the union or the grievant within the
time limit specified in each step, the grievance shall be considered settled on
the basis of the latest decision and not be subject to further appeal. Any
grievance not answered within the time limits specified in each step shall be
automatically appealed to the next step. Time limits at each step may be
extended only by mutual written agreement of the grievant and the village.
   (D)   No matter or action shall be treated as a grievance unless a grievance
is filed in accordance with this subchapter.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.089 COMPENSATION DURING GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   The grievant and Union Steward shall be paid to participate in the Step 1
and Step 2 meetings, if the meetings are conducted on work time. The grievant
and one employee representative shall be given paid time off to attend any
arbitration hearing conducted on working time when their presence is necessary
to a disposition of the grievance.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
LEAVES
§ 36.100 SICK LEAVE.
   (A)   Absence from work. With the exception of emergency situations,
absences from work due to illness or injury must be reported to the Police
Chief or her or his designee a minimum of three hours prior to the employee’s
assigned work shift. Scheduled appointments for examination or treatment by
medical professionals must be reported to the Police Chief with as much advance
notice as possible. Absences from work which do not meet these requirements
will be regarded as an unpaid absence without leave and may lead to
disciplinary action. If an officer becomes ill, or otherwise desires to use
sick leave during working hours, she or he must notify her or his supervisor
before leaving work.
   (B)   Sick leave usage. Sick leave may be used for illness of the employee
or for the illness of family members who are dependent upon the employee and
including: spouse; children (natural, step, or adopted) who reside with the
employee; and parents of the employee or parents of the employee’s spouse who
reside with the employee. If the duration of the illness lasts longer than one
day, the employee must notify the Chief of Police as soon as it is known that
further absences will result, but in no event later than three hours to the
next regularly scheduled work shift. After two consecutive days’ absence or
three events of sick leave usage in a three-month period, an employee may be
required to furnish a certificate from a physician to support the sick leave
claim or for any further sick leave usage. The employee may be required to be
examined by a physician designated by the village at the expense of the
village. Sick leave may only be used in increments of one hour. Failure to
follow the foregoing procedures or providing false or misleading information
may result in the absence being considered an unexcused absence for which no
pay will be received and may result in disciplinary action.
   (C)   Sick leave accrual. Full-time employees shall accrue sick leave at the
rate of six ten-hour days per year commencing on their first day of employment
and on their seniority date each year thereafter. Sick leave may be accrued to
a maximum of 360 hours. Should an officer reach the maximum accrual, no further
sick leave shall be accrued. There shall be no payment for any unused sick
leave to any officer at any time, including upon separation from the village.
   (D)   Sick leave pay. If the requirements for sick leave pay are met, an
officer shall receive straight time pay for those scheduled hours missed. Sick
leave pay shall not be considered hours worked for purposes of calculating
overtime. Therefore, if physically able, an officer may be called in to work
during a payroll week in which sick leave was taken and overtime may not
necessarily be paid, that is, the employee may receive more than 40 hours
straight time pay during that payroll week.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.101 PERSONAL LEAVE.
   (A)   Full-time officers will be given two personal days off with pay to be
used within the calendar year that commences on their seniority date and must
be used before the next anniversary date. Those officers working four ten-hour
shifts per week shall receive two ten-hour personal leave days. If an officer
is regularly scheduled to work five eight-hour shifts, she or he will receive
two eight-hour personal days off with pay.
   (B)   Personal leave with pay will be considered hours worked for purposes
of calculating overtime. Requests for personal days must be approved at least
72 hours in advance, except in emergency situations or situations where the
officer’s need for time out could not have been planned more than 72 hours in
advance. In those circumstances, requests must be made as soon as practical
and, to the extent possible, must not conflict with the manpower requirements
of the department. Personal leave must be taken in full shift increments for
one of the days, but may be taken in one-hour increments for the other. Any
personal days not used within the calendar year will be lost.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.102 MILITARY LEAVE.
   Military leave, without pay, will be granted as required by state or federal
law.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.103 JURY DUTY LEAVE.
   Full-time officers shall receive their regular base pay for the time spent
on jury duty upon signing and returning their jury duty checks to the village.
Officers called for jury duty will be scheduled for day shifts on the weeks
affected.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.104 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   Full-time employees shall be granted paid bereavement leave for the
scheduled work hours on three consecutive working days following a death of an
immediate family member (father, mother, children [including step or adopted],
brother, sister, father-in- law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law,
grandparents, grandchildren, and spouse). Barring an emergency scheduling
situation, the village will allow time off to attend the funeral of an aunt or
uncle. This leave will be without pay; however, the officer may use vacation or
personal leave time for the time off needed. Additional time off with pay
through the use of vacation or personal leave or without pay may be granted if
the time off does not conflict with the manpower requirements of the
department. The bereavement leave shall not be counted as hours worked for
purposes of calculating overtime.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.105 TRAINING TIME.
   (A)   All officers shall receive pay for all hours worked with a minimum of
two hours for attending approved training. The scheduling of the training and
the approval for the content of the training class must be received from the
Police Chief at least two weeks in advance of the training. Travel time for
training outside of the county will be considered hours worked, however, travel
time within the county will not be considered.
   (B)   For purposes of calculating overtime, training time will be considered
as hours worked. If the training was scheduled for eight hours, the officer
will receive a full eight hours’ pay. If an officer is ordinarily scheduled to
work ten hours and misses a full shift due to an eight-hour training day, the
officer will be paid for eight hour if the training was requested by the
officer and ten hours if requested by the village.
(Ord. 2014-07, passed 5-20-2014)
§ 36.106 VACATION USE.
   (A)   (1)   Paid vacations are provided to full-time employees in accordance
with length of continuous service. Annual vacation is earned according to the
following accrual schedule:
         (a)   One week after completing 12 months of continuous service;
         (b)   Two weeks after completing 24 months of continuous service;
         (c)   Three weeks after completing five years of continuous service;
and
         (d)   Four weeks after completing 12 years of continuous service.
      (2)   A week’s vacation shall mean 40 hours’ work time in a seven
consecutive day period.
   (B)   The vacation time becomes available for use on the anniversary date of
employment for the employee and must be used before the next anniversary date.
No vacation time is accrued for use in subsequent years and vacation time will
not be compensated by additional pay at the end of the employee’s anniversary
date unless the village requires cancellation of a scheduled week or day
vacation due to manpower requirements of the department. SCHEDULED in this
context means vacation time previously approved by the Chief as described in
division (C) below.
   (C)   (1)   Sign up for annual vacations will begin on December 1. The
Police Chief will post a calendar for vacation selection on or before December
1 blocking out those dates which the Chief has selected for his or her
vacation. Employees may then sign up for vacation dates (full work weeks only)
during the following calendar years. If there is a disagreement, the employee
with more seniority will be given first preference for the selection of
vacation dates during the sign-up period. No two full-time officers may select
vacation weeks at the same time. After December 31, vacation will be scheduled
on a first come, first serve basis. Officers may request individual days off
when another officer is using vacation time, subject to manpower requirements.
      (2)   Adjustments, cancellations, and rescheduling of vacation periods
including single days may occur during the calendar year, provided a minimum of
21 days’ written notice for multiple day changes and 14 days’ written notice
for single days is given to the Chief and that the changes do not create
conflicts with previously scheduled employee vacation periods. Any such
adjustment or scheduling shall be granted based on a first-come basis.

EMAIL REGULATIONS
§ 37.001 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for the proper use
and application of email by employees of the village. For purposes of this
chapter, the term EMPLOYEES OF THE VILLAGE and/or EMPLOYEES shall not be deemed
to include police officers who are employed by the Police Department. They
shall instead be regulated by Police Department procedures adopted/implemented
by the Police Chief. Email is a communication tool available to employees to
enhance efficiency in the performance of job duties and is to be used in
accordance with generally accepted business practices and current laws (e.g.,
the state’s Freedom of Information Act) Messages transmitted over the email
system must only be those that involve official business activities or contain
information essential to employees for the accomplishment of business-related
tasks and/or communication directly related to the business, administration, or
practices of the village.
(Ord. 2012-O-5, passed 4-17-2012; Ord. 2020-O-16, passed 8-18-2020)
§ 37.002 RIGHT OF PRIVACY.
   (A)   All email messages, including any attachments, that are transmitted
over village networks are considered village records and therefore are village
property. The village reserves the right to access, audit, and/or disclose, for
whatever reason, all messages, including attachments, that have been
transmitted, stored, accessed or received through any department system,
storage area or device.
   (B)   The email system is not a confidential system and therefore is not
appropriate for confidential communications. If a communication must be
confidential, an alternative method to communicate the message should be used.
Employees using the village email system shall have no expectation of privacy
concerning communications transmitted over the system.
   (C)   Employees should not use personal accounts to exchange email or other
information that is related to the official business of the village.

§ 37.003 PROHIBITED USE.
   (A)   Sending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, disrespectful, sexually
suggestive, harassing, unlawful, or any other inappropriate messages on the
email system is prohibited, will not be tolerated, and may result in
disciplinary action.
   (B)   Email messages addressed to the village are only to be used for
official business related uses. Personal advertisements or other commercial use
is not be acceptable.
   (C)   It is a violation of this policy to transmit a message under another

§ 37.057 POLICY.
   Public employees occupy a trusted position in the community, and thus, their
statements have the potential to contravene the policies and performance of the
village. Due to the nature of the work and influence associated with the
community-wide visibility of public employees, it is necessary that employees
of the village be subject to certain reasonable limitations on their speech and
expression. To achieve its mission and efficiently provide service to the
public, the village will carefully balance the individual employee’s rights
against the village’s needs and interests when exercising a reasonable degree
of control over its employees’ speech and expression.
(Ord. 2012-O-5, passed 4-17-2012; Ord. 2020-O-16, passed 8-18-2020)

   (C)   Employees should therefore not disseminate or post any information on
any forum or medium that could reasonably be anticipated to compromise the
safety or privacy of any employee, an employee’s family, or associates.

professionalism of the village or its employees. Speech or expression of any
form that could reasonably be foreseen as creating a negative impact on the
safety of the employees of the village.

audio recordings, likenesses or images of village logos, emblems, uniforms,
patches, marked vehicles, equipment, or other material that specifically

authorized purposes, or use of any personal communication device, game device,
or media device, whether personally or village-owned, for personal purposes
except in the following circumstances: when brief personal communication may be
warranted by circumstances (e.g., inform family of extended hours), during

GENERALLY
§ 38.01 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   Mass notification systems allow large numbers of people to be
contacted simultaneously via multiple methods including land-line phones, cell
phones, text messages and email. A new mass notification system has been
implemented in the village. The system, RAVE Alerts is capable of quickly
disseminating information to the population of the village, including village
RAVE employees, in less than ten minutes.
   (B)   (1)   RAVE Alerts will have the following capabilities:
         (a)   Ability to notify employees in an emergency;
         (b)   Ability to notify the community in an emergency; and
         (c)   Ability for the community to add additional methods of
notification including cell phone, email, text messaging for emergency and non-
emergency notifications.
      (2)   Community is defined as residents, businesses and frequent visitors
to the village. This chapter is not intended to replace personnel recall
policies and procedures for police employees.
(Ord. 2019-O-13, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 38.02 SYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The Village Board President and/or his or her designee will oversee
the overall use of the system. The Police Department will have the primary
responsibility for the dissemination of emergency information regarding
imminent police and fire incidents. The Information Systems Department is
responsible for the technical maintenance, data upload and the overall
technical operation of the system.
   (B)   Non-emergency communications will be facilitated by designated village
departments and personnel under the direction on the Village Board President.
All public safety nonemergency communications will be directed and facilitated
by designated public safety personnel.
(Ord. 2019-O-13, passed 10-1-2019)
SYSTEM OVERVIEW
§ 38.15 DATA SOURCES.
   There are four distinct data sources populating this system: employee data,
911 data, white and yellow page data, and opt-in data.
(Ord. 2019-O-13, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 38.16 EMPLOYEE DATA.
   (A)   The ability to contact employees is dependent in employees providing
accurate and current contact information to the village. It is responsible for
each village department to ensure their personnel’s information is updated,
including changes in contact information and identification of special skills.
Employee data will be maintained by the Office of Emergency Management. The
Information Systems Department will upload employee data into the system
quarterly to ensure the most recent data is readily available in a time of an
emergency.
   (B)   Each department will be responsible for collecting and submitting
current employee contact information on a quarterly basis.
   (C)   All village employees are required to prove contact information to be
used in the event of an emergency. Both state law and the village municipal
code state that all village employees may be designated as disaster service
workers in the event of a declared emergency.
   (D)   As designated disaster workers, employees are required to provide the
village with basic contact information. If information is found to be incorrect
during the testing phase, department heads will ask employees to update their
data. Employees will only be called in an emergency and the data will not be
used for non-emergency use/calls.
(Ord. 2019-O-13, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 38.17 911 DATA.
   The village is able to request 911 data from certain providers for uploads
to the RAVE Alerts. The data includes all published and unpublished landline
telephone numbers and their corresponding physical address. The data is
intended to be utilized for emergency notifications only and is considered
confidential. Upon receipt of the data from such providers, it is securely
transferred to the RAVE vendor for geocoding. During the geocoding process, the
vendor will attempt to remove as many duplicate records as possible in an
effort to prevent one residence or business from receiving multiple
notifications. The RAVE vendor is contracted to refresh the data.
(Ord. 2019-O-13, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 38.18 WHITE AND YELLOW PAGE DATA.
   This data is uploaded from the current white and yellow pages and includes
all business and resident numbers currently listed.
(Ord. 2019-O-13, passed 10-1-2019)
§ 38.19 OPT-IN AND OPT-OUT PAGES.
   (A)   RAVE Alerts allows those who live, work or spend time in the village
to select the type of information they wish the receive (such as public safety,
community events, traffic issues, construction and the like) and the way in
which they are contacted. The opt-in page allows people to add additional
contact information including cell phone numbers, email addresses, text
messages and business numbers. The community will have the ability to opt into
the system via the village’s website. Hard copy forms will be made available to
those who do not have computer access.
   (B)   Anyone who chooses to opt into the system will automatically be
registered into the village’s emergency alert category.
(Ord. 2019-O-13, passed 10-1-2019)
PUBLIC NOTIFICATION USAGES
§ 38.35 EMERGENCY VERSUS NON-EMERGENCY USAGE.
   (A)   Usage of the system has been divided between emergency and non-
emergency. Emergency use generally refers to a serious property or life-
threatening event or condition and non-emergency use generally refers to
community outreach, advertising, and information dissemination.
   (B)   RAVE Alerts should be used carefully, with the understanding that
numerous messages will dilute the effectiveness of life-threatening
notifications and can erode confidence in the system.
   (C)   Non-emergency uses will be coordinated through the Village President
and/or his or her designee. Public safety usage of the non-emergency category
shall be coordinated through the appropriate public safety authority.
(Ord. 2019-O-13, passed 10-1-2019)

DUAL WATER METERS FOR RESIDENCES
§ 51.20 GENERAL.
   Owners of single-family residences located within the village limits shall
be entitled to separately metered water purchased from the village and used
solely for purposes outside of the dwelling limited to the watering of laws
and/or gardens and use in swimming pools, hereinafter “sewer-exempt purposes.”
Said metering shall be separate and apart from all other water usage located on
the premises with the general main water meter remaining connected to same. The
additional water meter reserved for exclusively for said purpose and
hereinafter referred to as “second water meter” shall be connected to separated
pipes and plumbing limited strictly to sewer-exempt purposes.
(Ord. 98-1, passed 3-17-1998)
§ 51.21 METHODS.
   Residents desiring to utilize the second water meter shall have the
following options.
   (A)   Temporary meter. Residents may utilize a temporary second water meter
provided by the village and connected under the supervision of the village for
service running from the months of no earlier than April 1 and no later than
November 1 of each year. To secure a meter, the resident shall tender a deposit
of $75 with her or his permit application which shall be returned upon the
return of said second water meter in good condition on or before November 1 of
each year.
   (B)   Permits and fees. To install a temporary second water meter, a
resident must submit a completed application attached to the ordinance codified
herein and identified as Form 2 together with an annual fee in the amount of
$40 in addition to the deposit, if required. Such application shall be
completed for each year a temporary second water meter is used. Only one
initial application shall be submitted for a permanent second water meter. An
annual fee of $20 for the permanent second water meter shall be paid when
billed by the village. Failure to make timely payment shall constitute the
election and waiver of the applicant to receive the audit provided for in §
51.22.
   (C)   Permanent meter. At said resident’s expense, the resident may
alternatively elect to install a permanent second water meter for the purposes
identified under this subchapter to be installed by a licensed plumber. In such
instance, the resident must first secure a permit to do so from the village and
further submit an affidavit substantially similar to Form 1 attached to the
ordinance codified herein from said licensed plumber confirming that said
second water meter has been connected consistent with the requirements of this
subchapter. In the event that a resident elects to install a permanent second
water meter, said resident shall further consent to inspection by the village
upon 24 hours’ written notice for the purposes of confirming that plumbing is
appropriately connected to said second water meter consistent with the
requirements of this chapter. In the event that access is either denied by the
resident or, in the alternative, that the village determines that the resident
has illegally connected said second water meter, then as a condition of
accepting a permanent second water meter, the credit provided resident in §
51.22 will discontinue until such time as the violation has been corrected
where the inspection has taken place confirming that no violation exists. This
remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy provided for under this
ordinance or otherwise by law.
   (D)   Back flow. All meters, whether permanent or temporary, shall contain
certified “back flow” prevention devises sufficient to prevent the back flow of
any water into the village’s water system.
(Ord. 98-1, passed 3-17-1998)
§ 51.22 PURPOSE.
   For those residents who legally utilize either a temporary second water
meter or a permanent second water meter, in calculating the sewer use tax
charged to water bills, the village shall exclude the gallons of water
accounted for on the second water meter for the period extending from April 1
to November 1 of each year. Gallons accrued in any other month shall be
included in the sewer use tax charged to water bills. All such meters shall be
available for reading between the 15 and 20 days of each month. Failure to make
meters available shall waive any credits for that month.
(Ord. 98-1, passed 3-17-1998)
§ 51.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter, except
§ 51.03, shall be served by the village with written notice stating the nature
of the violation and providing a reasonable time limitation for the
satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time
stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
   (B)   Any person who continues any violations beyond the time limit provided
for in this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be fined in an amount not exceeding $150 for each violation. Each day in
which any such violation continues is a separate offense.
   (C)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall become liable
to the village for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the village by reason
of such violation.
(Prior Code, § 13.16.060)
   (D)   In the event that any individual owns property which has a second
water meter or other water meter connected in violation of this subchapter or
any individual engages in activity to connect a water meter in violation of
this subchapter, such a violation shall constitute a violation of this
subchapter and shall result in a fine of not less than $75 and not more than
$750. In such event, the village, at its election, may seek injunctive relief
to correct the illegal hookup. In the event that any such violation, the
resident shall permanently be prohibited from having a second water meter
either permanent or temporary.

reconstruction and expansion in obligations of the U.S. Government, or
obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government or
any agency thereof; or shall deposit such amounts in accounts fully
collateralized by obligations of the U.S. Government or by obligations fully

nuisance exists or the person causing, permitting, or maintaining such nuisance
to abate or remove such nuisance within 24 hours of service or posting of the

chapter, transportation to and from the property, title searches or
certifications, preparation of lien documents, foreclosure, and other related
reasonable attorney’s expenses.
   (C)   A copy of the notice of lien shall be mailed by the Clerk to the owner
of the property, or to the occupant, or to the person or persons in whose name
such real estate was last billed for property tax purposes.
   (D)   The real estate subject to a lien for such an unpaid assessment of
such costs and expenses may be sold for non-payment thereof, and the proceeds
of the sale applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs.
   (E)   The Village Attorney may institute proceedings in the name of the
village of any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property
for which such costs and expenses have remained unpaid 30 days after a
statement of such costs and expenses have been mailed to the property owner, to
the occupant, or to the person or persons in whose name the property was last
billed for property tax purposes.
   (F)   Upon payment of the costs and expenses, plus interest from the date 30

TREE STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF- WAY
§ 92.15 PROHIBITION OF TREE REMOVAL.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to remove any tree located on village
property, without written permission of the Village Board.
(Ord. 84-2, passed 4-3-1984) Penalty, see § 92.99
§ 92.16 POLICY.
   (A)   These standards are to be considered as the Standards (And
Establishing a Shade Tree Committee) and (An Ordinance Requiring Owners to
Maintain Parkways).
   (B)   These standards apply to the planting of trees by the Department of
Street and Alley individuals, business, or other organizations on rights-of-way
owned and maintained by the village.
   (C)   Exceptions to these standards can only be made with the advance
approval of the Board. Anyone seeking an exception must seek a hearing before
the Village Shade Tree Committee.
   (D)   These standards take effect when approved by the Board.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996)
§ 92.17 PLANTING LOCATIONS.
   (A)   Species and cultivars that exceed a trunk diameter of 15 inches at
breast height within 40 years are not to be planted, where the parkway is less
than five feet wide.
   (B)   Trees must be planted at least ten feet from driveways and alleys, ten
feet from fire hydrants, ten feet from utility poles, 35 feet from
intersections, 35 feet from traffic signals, and five feet from a property
line.
   (C)   Trees planted under utility lines must be of species and cultivars
whose height at maturity will not interfere with the lines.
   (D)   Trees planted along existing village streets are to be spaced at 30-
to 40-inch intervals for medium to large tree species and 20 to 35 inches for
small tree species.
   (E)   There should be adequate space allowed for a sidewalk when trees are
planted along unpaved streets or along streets without curbing.
   (F)   When sufficient space is not available for a public right-of-way as a
result of street widening or buried utilities, trees may be planted on private
property not more than ten feet from the public right-of-way if the property
owner gives permission by signing a memorandum of understanding with the
village. This subchapter provides that it is the responsibility of the property
owner to provide for all maintenance, including pruning, watering, and removal,
during the existence of such trees.
   (G)   Trees may be planted by the village along publicly owned sidewalks
that go through subdivisions, not following streets, when the Village Board
Shade Tree Committee deems the planting beneficial to the community as a whole.
The trees may be planted either on public rights-of-way or on private property
subject to the provisions of division (F) above.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996)
§ 92.18 KINDS OF TREES.
   (A)   
Appendix A gives a list of trees approved for planting along public rights-of-
way in the village. Only trees on this list may be used.
   (B)   
Appendix B gives a list of trees prohibited. These may not be used except when
a specific exception has been granted under §
92.02(C).
   (C)   Any tree species not listed on either the approved or on the
prohibited list for which consent has been given by the Building Inspector.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996)
§ 92.19 QUALITY OF TREES.
   (A)   All trees must be true to species, variety, and/or cultivar, and each
plant must be labeled when delivered.
   (B)   All trees must have normal trunks, leaders, tops, and branches typical
of the species, variety, or cultivar, and exhibit evidence of proper nursery
pruning practices.
   (C)   All trees must be certified free of insect pests and diseases by the
State Department of Agriculture, Division of Entomology.
   (D)   All trees must be free of mechanical injuries and not show evidence of
recent or previous wounds on the trunk.
   (E)   All trees must be nursery grown and must have received proper
fertilizing, watering, top, and root pruning as is normally needed for that
particular kind of tree. Plants must have been grown in nursery conditions for
the past two years under soil and climate conditions similar to that of the
village.
   (F)   All plants must be balled and burlapped. The twine used to tie the
burlap must not be plastic. The balls should be of firm earth from the original
soil in which the tree grew in the nursery. No trees with broken, loose, or
manufactured balls are acceptable.
   (G)   Plants on the list of approved medium to large trees must have trunks
at least one and one-half inches in diameter measured six inches above the
ground and a soil ball of at least 24 inches in diameter. Plants on the list of
small trees must be at least one inch in diameter measured six inches above the
ground and have a soil ball of at least 18 inches in diameter.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996)
§ 92.20 PLANTING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   The planting hold should be four times larger in diameter than the
diameter of the root ball and the same depth as the height of the root ball.
   (B)   The root ball should be placed in the hole so that the plants are
planted with the top of the ball flush with not more than one inch higher than
the top of the hole.
   (C)   After placing the plant in the hole, the hole should be filled with
backfill so that no air pockets are left beneath or around the ball. The
backfill should be tamped so that it is packed firmly.
   (D)   The twine holding the burlap around the ball must be cut and the
burlap loosened from around the top of the ball. Do not attempt to remove the
burlap from beneath the ball. Any plastic or treated burlap used to protect the
ball during shipment must be removed before planting.
   (E)   The trunks should be vertical after planting.
   (F)   Excess soil should be removed from the site and a layer of mulch
placed around the tree.
   (G)   Plants should be watered at the time of planting.
   (H)   A lawn-mower guard of the type approved by the Shade Tree Committee
should be placed around the base of the trunk.
   (I)   Staking is not typically recommended; however, when necessary, follow
current recommendations.
   (J)   Plants should be judiciously pruned after planting to remove broken,
weak, and interfering branches and multiple leaders.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996)
§ 92.21 EARLY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Newly planted trees, shrubs, and other plants require special
maintenance for one or two growing seasons following planting. All maintenance
practices shall follow approved arboricultural standards.
   (B)   Watering. Ample soil moisture shall be maintained following planting.
A thorough watering once in five to ten days, depending on soil type and
drainage provisions, is usually adequate during the growing season. A soil
augur can be used to check the adequacy of moisture in the soil ball and/or
backfill.
   (C)   Fertilization. Adequate quantities of the essential nutrient elements
should be available after new root growth starts. However, provision of good
drainage and adequate moisture of the backfill, or the soil ball on balled
plants, is more important than fertilization immediately following planting.
   (D)   Insect and disease control. Frequent and thorough inspections shall be
made to determine with measures for the control of insects and diseases shall
be taken. Plants are in a weakened condition following transplanting and they
are more susceptible to insects, especially borers, and disease than are
vigorously growing trees. Where it is necessary to spray, insecticides or
fungicides shall be used that are labeled for the purpose intended.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996)
§ 92.22 PRUNING.
   (A)   (1)   Pruning newly planted trees shall consist of removing dead,
broken, or injured branches and the suppression of rank, uneven growth that
affects form. Water sprouts shall be removed when they reach the diameter of a
pencil.
      (2)   Pruning shall be practiced as often thereafter as needed to assure
sturdy crotch development.
      (3)   Tree crowns should be elevated as growth characteristics and
location dictate. Newly planted trees need not have lower branches removed
until they are well established.
   (B)   (1)   No topping or dehorning of trees shall be permitted, except by
written permission of the Village Maintenance Supervisor. Proper cabling and
bracing shall be substituted for this practice wherever possible.
      (2)   All large, established trees shall be pruned to the following
height to allow free passage of pedestrians and vehicular traffic: at least
seven feet over sidewalks and a minimum clearance of 14 feet over all streets.
      (3)   It shall be the policy of the Village Maintenance Supervisor to
cooperate with the municipal or utility lighting engineer, and vice versa, in
the placement and selection of lighting standards and the development of a
system of tree pruning that will give effective street illumination.
      (4)   All cuts shall be made with a saw or pruner and only at the nodes
or crotches. No stubs shall be left. No spurs or climbing irons shall be used
in the trees, except when trees are to be removed.
      (5)   All dead branches shall be removed; branches that cross or rub
should be pruned to eliminate the problem.
      (6)   All wounds over three inches in diameter shall be treated with a
suitable tree wound dressing.
      (7)   To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, all pruning tools
must be disinfected before being used on a new tree.
      (8)   Whenever streets are to be blocked off to public service, all
police and fire departments shall be notified of the location and length of
time the street will be blocked. Notifications shall be given these departments
upon the removal of such barriers or if such barriers are to remain longer than
originally expected.
      (9)   To protect the public from danger, suitable street and sidewalk
barriers, highway cones, or signs shall be used when pruning a tree. Signals,
flares, or flasher lights shall be placed on all barriers or obstructions
remaining in the street after dark.
      (10)   The stumps of all removed trees shall be cut to at least six
inches below the ground level and the soil cavity shall be filled with soil and
be leveled.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.23 OTHER MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Spraying.
      (1)   Suitable precautions shall be taken to protect and warn the public
that spraying is being done.
      (2)   Spraying shall be done only for the control of specific diseases or
insects, with the proper materials in the necessary strength, and applied at
the proper time to obtain the desired control. All spraying practices shall
conform to federal and state regulations.
      (3)   Dormant oil sprays shall not be applied to sugar maple, Japanese
maple, beech, flowering dogwood, hickory, walnut, and most crabapple trees.
Dormant oil sprays shall be applied only when the air temperature is at least
40° F. for a period of 24 hours after spraying.
   (B)   Fertilization.
      (1)   Fertilization of public trees shall follow the recommendations of
the Natural History Survey or other accepted arboricultural standards.
      (2)   Methods of application of fertilizers shall be specified by the
Village Maintenance Supervisor.
   (C)   Cavities. Extensive cavity work should be performed on trees only if
they are of sufficiently high value to justify the cost. All cavity work shall
conform to the National Arborist Association or other acceptable arboricultural
standards.
   (D)   Cabling and bracing.
      (1)   As a general rule, cables should be located above the crotch at a
point approximately two-thirds of the distance between the crotch and tops of
the branch ends. Rust-resistant cables, thimbles, and lags should be used. The
ends of a cable should be attached to hooks or eyes of lags or bolts inserted
near the ends of the branches; thimbles must be used in the eye splice in each
end of the cable. In no instance shall cable be wrapped around a branch.
      (2)   All cabling and bracing practices with screw rods shall follow
National Arborist Association or other accepted arboricultural standards.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.24 TREE PROTECTION.
   (A)   Construction zone.
      (1)   It is the responsibility of the permit holder, as a condition of
permit, to protect all public trees located on the adjacent public right-of-way
that may reasonably be expected to be affected or damaged by construction
activities. Existing trees subject to construction damage shall be boxed,
fenced, or otherwise protected before any work is started. The trees to be
protected, the method of protection, and the dimensions involved shall be
determined by the Village Maintenance Supervisor conjunctly with the permit
holder or his or her agent. Once assembled, no boxing, fencing, or other
protection device shall be removed without prior approval of the Village
Maintenance Supervisor, and there will be no construction activity or material
within the enclosure.
      (2)   (a)   Small trees, as determined by the Village Maintenance
Supervisor, shall be boxed or fenced in such a manner as to encompass the
entire drip line area of the tree (Appendix C). In no case shall the enclosure
be less than two feet from the centerline of the tree.
         (b)   Medium to large trees shall be boxed or fenced in a manner
determined by the Village Maintenance Supervisor based on sound arboricultural
practices. In no case shall the protective device be closer than ten feet from
the centerline of the tree except in those portions bordered by the public
sidewalk or curb, in which case the protective device shall be offset one
wherever possible (
Appendix C).
   (B)   Utility installations (underground). All installations of the
underground utilities upon the public right-of-way are subject to approval by
the village. Any and all installations that impact on public trees due to
underground conflicts (roots) are specifically subject to the review and
approval of the Village Maintenance Supervisor before the project starts.
(Ord. 96-2, passed 4-2-1996)
§ 92.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is provided shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   Any party who violates §
92.15 shall be subject to a fine of $500. In the event said fine is not paid
upon demand, then proceedings may be instituted in the name of the village in
any court having jurisdiction over such matters, against said party requesting
judgment to be entered in the amount of $500 plus court costs and reasonable
attorney fees to be affixed by the court.
   (C)   (1)   In the event any of the provisions of §§
92.16 through
92.24 are violated, the village shall have the authority to seek any one or any
combination of the following remedies:
         (a)   Injunctive relief;
         (b)   A fine for each violation in an amount not to exceed $100; and
         (c)   Entitlement to have any tree removed which is in violation with
the cost of said removal as a lien against the abutting property and judgment
against the party responsible for the violation.
      (2)   The foregoing remedies shall be available to the village following
a determination by a Village Building Inspector that §§
92.16 through
92.24 have been violated, and a ten-day notice to abate has been served upon
the owner of the adjacent property and/or violator, personally or by certified
mail addressed to the owner or resident at the abutting property, and/or
violator’s address with a copy by first class mail. Notwithstanding any notice

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   These regulations are designed to provide standards and rules related
to the making, reviewing, filing, and recording of subdivision and development
plans and plats, and to provide for preliminary and final approval or rejection
of such plans or plats, or portions thereof, by the village and as set forth in
this chapter.
   (B)   SUBDIVISION OF LAND shall mean the division of land as defined in the
ILCS and as further defined in this chapter.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 1)
§ 153.002 OBJECTIVES.
   Pursuant to the authority conferred by state statutes, the objectives of
these regulations are to provide for the orderly growth and harmonious
development of the village; to secure adequate traffic circulation by means of
coordinated street systems with relation to major thoroughfares and street
adjoining subdivision, public walkways, public facilities, and other land uses;
to achieve individual lots of reasonable utility and livability; to facilitate
adequate provisions for transportation, water supply, stormwater drainage,
sanitary sewerage, and health requirements; to establish standards for the
construction of public improvements; to encourage the installation of street
lights and street trees; to encourage adequate provisions for recreations
areas, open space, school sites, and other public ways and facilities; to
encourage adequate provisions for the control of erosion and sediment during
development and construction; to encourage the installation of underground
utilities; to provide for the further subdivision of tracts into smaller or
larger parcels of land; and to provide administrative and review procedures for
the attainment of these objectives.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 1)
§ 153.003 RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AND OTHER ORDINANCES.
   This chapter is one of several documents in effect and force in the village
that govern the use and development of land. Other applicable relevant
documents include the Comprehensive Plan, which includes the Major Street Plan
and Land Use Plan;
Chapter 154; §§
92.16 through
92.24; and Chapters
51 and
52. Where and if the provisions of these documents conflict, the stricter of
the regulations shall apply. For contiguous areas outside of the corporate
limits of the village, the County Zoning Ordinance may be applicable.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 1)
§ 153.004 SUBDIVISION CONTROL.
   (A)   For the purpose of the present and future development of the village
and for the promotion of public health and safety, morals, comfort, and welfare
of persons living within the territory governed, the provisions and regulations
hereinafter contained which shall govern the subdivision and platting of land
lying within the corporate limits of the village as now or hereafter existing,
or within the area of jurisdiction of the village as now or hereafter
established under the provision of the state statutes, are hereby adopted as
part of the Official Plan of the village.
   (B)   These regulations are further for the purpose of controlling the
future development of the village and for the promotion of the public health
and safety, comfort, morals, and welfare of persons living within the territory
governed by the village. The provisions and regulations in this chapter shall
govern the subdivision and platting of lands and civil engineering improvements
within planned unit developments and condominiums lying within the corporate
limits of the village as now or hereafter existing and, to the extent that such
provisions and regulations may be applicable, shall also govern the subdivision
and platting of lands, and the civil engineering improvements within planned
unit developments, condominiums, or subdivision lying within contiguous
territory which is not more than one and one-half miles beyond the corporate
limits of the village.
   (C)   There are three types of requirements on which subdivision approval is
conditioned.
      (1)   First, a prohibition against any subdivision activity in areas
where street access, soil, subsoil, or flooding conditions would create dangers
to health and safety if development were allowed.
      (2)   Second, the proposed subdivision should be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan for the village. This includes requirements for reservation
of space within the subdivision for planned parks, schools, public roads, and
other improvements.
      (3)   Third, the subdivision should be designed in a manner that avoids
overburdening area facilities which often are located outside the subdivision
itself.

§ 153.026 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
   The purpose and objectives regarding land subdivision can best be understood
by considering the various duties and responsibilities associated with land
subdividing. The specific duties and responsibilities of the individuals or
groups listed below are clearly identified in these regulations.
   (A)   Subdivider. The subdivider is responsible for initiating discussions
with the village before thoroughly preparing any subdivision drawings or plats
in order to become familiar with these regulations and the public policies and
objectives applicable to the territory in which the proposed subdivision lies.
   (B)   Engineer and surveyor. The Engineer and surveyor acting on behalf of
the subdivider are responsible for preparing the necessary subdivision
drawings, surveys, and plats and the engineering drawings and specifications as
required by these regulations.
   (C)   Reviewing authority. The reviewing authority is the Board of Trustees
which is responsible for reviewing the subdivision plan or plat, or portions
thereof, and approving those that fully meet the provisions and requirements of
these regulations.
   (D)   Plat Officer. The Chairperson of the Plan Commission shall serve as
the Plat Officer and shall receive drawings, plats, and other documents as
herein provided and furnish them to the various parties involved as provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 4.2)
§ 153.027 ZONING.
   (A)   If the proposed subdivision lies within the corporate limits of the
village, the developer must first satisfy the zoning requirements in
Chapter 154, as adopted and as amended.
   (B)   If the proposed subdivision lies outside the village limits but within
the jurisdictional area of said village, then the developer must first satisfy
the zoning requirements in the County Zoning Ordinance, as adopted and as
amended.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 4.3)
§ 153.028 INFORMAL DISCUSSION PHASE.
   The purpose of the informal discussion phase, insofar as possible, is to
guide and assist the subdivider in his or her future decisions with a view to
avoiding later difficulties and delays. This is the basic policy stage, during
which the subdivider meets with the Board of Trustees. In the course of the
discussions the subdivider should make known his or her tentative drawings for
subdividing and development, and may exhibit sketches and drawings and shall be
apprised by the Board concerning specific public policies and objectives which
the Board may have for the area in question. Discussion at this phase shall
involve the entire area of ownership and anticipated development.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 4.5)
§ 153.029 PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW.
   (A)   Submission. A pre-application conference may be requested by all
subdividers prior to initial plat applications. Subdividers may contact the
Plat Officer to arrange a pre-application conference. Subdividers may submit
sketches or drawings at this stage with material sufficient to identify the
tract and establish the relationship of the proposed development with
surrounding area.
   (B)   Processing.
      (1)   Upon a request for a pre-application conference, the Plat Officer
shall schedule the pre-application conference for the next meeting of the Plan
Commission. All materials will be considered as submitted for informal
discussion. Discussions will involve the proposals in compliance with these
regulations, determination of the scope of the proposed subdivision, an outline
of the procedures for the recording of plats, and general information
exchanges.
      (2)   No approvals will result from this conference; however, the Plan
Commission may make recommendations on the scope of the initial Plat
application by the subdivider, continuity of the proposed street pattern with
existing or proposed streets adjacent to the proposed subdivision, and other
factors based on peculiarities of the area in which the subdivision is
proposed.
   (C)   Review. Review of any material submitted by the subdivider during the
informal discussion phase shall be made by the Plan Commission. Any sketch or
drawing submitted shall be studied with regard to the best principles of land
subdividing and development; to lot sizes and proportions; to existing and
planned land uses; to topography and drainage; to provisions for recreation
areas, public open space, schools, parks, and other public facilities; to
design and location of streets; and to conformity with the continuity of
existing street systems, walkways, and related matters.
   (D)   Inspection. The Plan Commission may make an inspection of the site to
determine its relationship to and effect upon major thoroughfares, utility
systems, and adjacent land uses (existing and planned) and ascertain the
existence of any unusual problems; and shall determine:
      (1)   The conformity of the proposed development to existing zoning
regulations, official road maps, and municipal development plans and policies;
      (2)   The effect of the proposed development upon schools, public open
spaces, and other nearby community facilities; and

official preliminary plat, provided that this portion is clearly designated and
provided that this portion of the area general plan submitted as the official
preliminary plat conforms to the regulations for preliminary plats.
      (6)   The approval of the area general plan by the Plan Commission shall
be in effect for a period of at least one year from the approval date, but the
approval is subject thereafter to withdrawal by the Plan Commission upon notice
to the developer after that date.
      (7)   The approval of the area general plan shall confer upon the

plat or parts thereof, as provided by these regulations. Applications for re-
subdividing or replatting shall be accompanied by a fee as determined from
time-to-time by resolution of the Board of Trustees.
   (A)   Procedure for re-subdivision. For any change in a map of an approved
or recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved thereon for public use, or any lot line, or if it
affects any map or plan legally reached prior to the adoption of any
regulations controlling subdivision, such parcel shall be approved by the Plan
Commission and Board of Trustees by the same procedure, rules, and regulations
as for review and approval of a subdivision, or if said subdivision is
classified as a minor subdivision, under the procedures as set forth for review
and approval of a minor subdivision.
   (B)   Procedure for subdivisions where future re-subdivision is indicated.
Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or
more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be re-subdivided into small building sites, the Plan
Commission and Board of Trustees may require that such parcel of land allow for
the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets.
Easements providing for the future opening and extension of such streets may be
made a requirement of the plat.
   (C)   Vacation of plats.
      (1)   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written
instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same
to be vacated. Such an instrument shall be approved by the Plan Commission and
the Board of Trustees in like manner as plats of subdivisions. The governing
body may reject any such instrument which abridges or destroys any public
rights in any of its public uses, improvements, streets, or alleys.
      (2)   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged, or approved,
and recorded and filed in like manner as plats of subdivision; and being duly
recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, alley, and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described
in such plat.
      (3)   When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in the manner
herein provided by all the owners of lots in such plat joining in the execution
of such writing.

to the state’s Standard Specification for Water and Sewer Main Construction;
      (6)   (a)   Performance guarantee and surety shall be on file. This
surety shall be one of the following:
            1.   Corporate surety bond (as approved by the State Insurance
Services Office), as approved by Village Attorney;
            2.   Certification of deposit as approved by Village Attorney; or
            3.   Irrevocable letter of credit from an insured bank, as approved
by Village Attorney.
         (b)   All publicly and privately owned public type improvements,
facilities, and development required by this chapter shall be guaranteed in a
form approved by the Village Attorney, and shall be delivered to guarantee
construction of the required improvements. The amount of the performance
guarantee and surety shall be based on the estimated value of the improvements
at the time of approval of the subdivision, insuring the village adequate
coverage to secure the satisfactory construction, installation, and dedication
of the uncompleted portions of the required improvements. The Village Attorney
shall approve such performance guarantee only after a recommendation of
approval of the amount of the guarantee is received from the Village Engineer;
         (c)   The amount of the performance guarantee shall be at a rate of
150% of the estimated cost of public facilities construction as determined by
the developer’s engineer, after review and comment by the Village Engineer;
         (d)   Upon substantial completion of major segments of public
improvements with appropriate documentation submitted by the developer’s
engineer, and after initial tentative acceptance of the completed improvements
by the village, the amount of the performance guarantee may be reduced in
stages to reflect the segments completed, but in no case shall the remaining
bond be less than 15% of the cost of completing the entire improvements, all
upon recommendations by the Village Engineer and the Village Attorney, and
approval granted by the Board of Trustees; and
         (e)   Any guarantee shall only be released upon the certification by
the developer’s engineer (with the approval of the Village Engineer) that the
public type improvements and facilities have been constructed in compliance
with the drawings and specifications for such public type facilities and
improvements. If construction of the improvements was commenced prior to
approval of the subdivision, the developer shall pay a penalty fee as
determined by resolution from tune to time by the Board of Trustees.
      (7)   After inspection and acceptance of the facilities and improvements,
but before release of the construction performance bond for all of the
facilities and improvements, a deposit shall be made to the village by a
maintenance bond equal to 50% of the construction cost of the public facilities
and improvements. This deposit shall be a guarantee of satisfactory performance
of the facilities constructed for and within the planned unit development and
satisfactory maintenance operation of such publicly and privately owned
facilities necessary to the health, safety, and convenience of the tenants or
successors to the applicant.
         (a)   Such bond for the publicly owned facilities shall be held by the
village for a period of 12 months after acceptance by the village of such
publicly owned facilities.
         (b)   The bond is to remain in effect as long as the public facilities
remain in private ownership. Nothing in the above maintenance guarantee clause
should be construed to prevent the filing of two maintenance guarantees, one
for publicly owned public facilities and one for privately owned public
facilities. After such 12 months, the bond covering the maintenance of publicly
owned public facilities shall be returned if no defects have developed, or if
any defects have developed, then the balance of such bonding shall be refunded
after reimbursement for amounts expended in correcting defective facilities.
The guarantee maintenance deposit under this division (D)(7) shall be made
immediately upon inspection and approval by the Village Engineer of the
construction of all facilities, but prior to release of the construction
guarantee.
   (E)   (1)   The submittal or resubmittal of a planned unit development (be
it within the corporate limits of the village or within the one and one-half
mile extraterritorial jurisdictional area of the village) which includes a
mobile home or trailer court (as such term is defined in Chapter 154, as
supplemented and amended) shall be accompanied by an application fee as
determined from time-to-time by resolution of the Board of Trustees.
      (2)   Checks shall be made payable to the Village of Tolono. The payment
of this fee shall be in addition to any other fees required by this chapter or
any other ordinance.

§ 153.037 CONSTRUCTION AND REVIEW OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Improvements required and/or regulated by this chapter shall be
constructed in accordance with adopted engineering drawings and specifications,
the standards, requirements, and regulations set forth in this chapter, and
other applicable ordinances of the village.
   (B)   If, in the course of construction, the subdivider wishes to
significantly modify (as determined by the Village Engineer) the size, type,
quality, quantity, and/or location of any or all of the improvements required
or regulated by these regulations, the subdivider’s engineer shall submit a
written change request to the Village Engineer for review and written approval
prior to proceeding with installation of the modified improvement.
   (C)   The developer’s engineer shall conduct an inspection of the
constructed improvements, and shall identify any incomplete work or
deficiencies in the construction work. A copy of the list which identifies
incomplete, deficient, or defective work shall be provided to the village. Upon
completion of the construction work needed to address and correct items on said
list, the developer’s engineer shall notify the Village Engineer and village
that the improvements are substantially complete, and ready for final
observation by the village. The notification shall be accompanied by pre-final
“record” drawings which depict the constructed improvements, and any other
testing results and documents required to verify compliance with requirements
during construction.
   (D)   Within approximately two weeks of receipt of the pre-final record
drawings and the notification of substantial completion, the Village Engineer
shall conduct a final observation of the constructed improvements. The
developer’s engineer shall attend the final observation. At that time, the
Village Engineer will identify any additional defects, deficiencies, or
incomplete work. The developer shall correct the additional defects,
deficiencies, or incomplete work identified within a reasonable time
thereafter.
   (E)   In the event that the final inspection identifies a significant number
(i.e., more than 20) of additional detects, deficiencies, or incomplete work
items, the final inspection shall be repeated to verify completion of the
corrective construction activities. In the event that a second final inspection
is required, the Village Clerk shall bill the subdivider for the village’s cost
for the second inspection and any subsequent inspections necessitated by the
subdivider’s failure to construct improvements in accordance with approved
engineering drawings and specifications and this chapter. Such costs shall be
based on the actual out-of-pocket costs incurred by the village. The
subdivider’s construction performance bond shall not be released until the
village has been reimbursed for these costs.
   (F)   After all corrective work has been completed, the developer’s engineer
shall certify that all improvements have been fully completed and that there
are no known defects or deficiencies in the constructed improvements.

to expedite and to minimize public and private costs for the review of
subdivisions which have little or no required public improvements, which have
little or no effect on existing public improvements, which will not likely
negatively impact surrounding property in a manner significantly different than
if the property had not been subdivided, and thus which do not require the Plan
Commission and the Board of Trustees to make policy decisions.
   (B)   Eligibility criteria. A minor subdivision is a subdivision of land
into four or fewer lots which meets the following eligibility criteria:
      (1)   Does not require, under these subdivision regulations, the design

regulations, unless previously waived by the entity with jurisdiction;
      (5)   Is located within the village or is otherwise the subject of an
annexation agreement which requires and sets forth the condition of its future
annexation to the village; and
      (6)   Contains lots all of which front on an existing street or roadway,
and not involving extension of any new street, roadway, or easement of access.
   (C)   Application for minor subdivision approval. The owner shall submit an
application for minor subdivision approval to the Village Plat Officer on forms
provided by the village. The application shall be accompanied by the following
documents:

mailed to each of the utility companies, and all public or quasi-public
agencies affected by the proposed subdivision. The mailing documents must
indicate that written comments be submitted to the village not later than 14
days thereafter, and that no comment in the time specified shall be deemed no
adverse comment;
      (11)   Six copies of a sketch drawing depicting the location of any
existing buildings, structures, or human-made features on the proposed minor
subdivision at a scale not less than one inch equals 100 feet. The sketch
drawing shall be of sufficient detail to verify compliance with applicable
zoning requirements. Lettering shall be not smaller than one-twelfth of an inch
in height, and drawing shall be readily legible without magnification; and
      (12)   List of waivers or deferrals requested, if any.
   (D)   Approval procedure.

EXCAVATION AND BACKFILL FOR UNDERGROUND PIPING
§ 153.140 GENERAL.
   (A)   (1)   For the purpose of this subchapter, UNDERGROUND PIPING shall be
considered pressure pipe, drainpipe, plumbing pipe, storm sewers, wastewater
sewers, or any other pipe conduit indicated on the drawings (including piping
referred to in §§
153.170 through
153.174,
153.185 through
153.190, and
153.205 through
153.216).
      (2)   (a)   Whenever the term “pipe” or “pipeline” is used, it shall mean
UNDERGROUND PIPING. It is intended that piping be installed by constructing
open trenches, unless specifically shown otherwise on the drawings.
         (b)   Piping shall not be installed by methods which do not allow the
pipe to be bedded in granular material, such as installation with a trenching
machine. Piping may be installed by the boring and jacking method, with or
without casing piping, as required by the condition of the installation.
   (B)   Excavation and backfill for underground piping shall include all
excavation, backfilling, compacting, disposal of surplus material, and all
other work incidental to the construction of trenches, including any additional
excavation which may be required for manholes or other structures forming a
part of the pipeline.
   (C)   Along the route of the new piping, the surface materials shall be
removed only to such widths as will permit a trench to be excavated which will
afford sufficient room for proper efficiency and proper construction. Where
sidewalks, driveways, pavements, and curb and gutter are encountered, care
shall be taken to protect against fracture or disturbance beyond reasonable
working limits. Topsoil suitable for final grading and landscaping shall be
piled separately, in locations authorized by the Village Maintenance
Superintendent or the developer’s engineer, and preserved so that it may be
restored after the remainder of the backfill is so placed.
   (D)   The subdivider may conduct exploratory excavation to determine if an
elevation conflict exists between a new pipeline and an existing utility. These
exploratory excavations shall be performed far enough in advance of the work
so, after consultation with the developer’s engineer, any necessary adjustments
to the line and grade of the new pipeline can be made.
   (E)   The subdivider may make any exploratory excavation necessary to
confirm the correct size, type, and number of fittings or valves required at a
particular location.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.141 HAND OR MACHINE EXCAVATION.
   (A)   Where working space will permit, trenches may be excavated by machine,
provided that by so doing, public and private improvements will not be
subjected to an unreasonable amount of damage.
   (B)   If, however, excavation by machine methods cannot be made without
material damage being done to public and private improvements, hand excavation
shall be employed.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.142 WIDTH OF EXCAVATION.
   (A)   The trench shall be excavated to an elevation four inches below the
bottom of the pipe and so that the flow line of the finished pipeline will be
at the depth and grade specified or established by the developer’s engineer.
For trench depths of five feet or less and when sheeting and shoring is not
required, the trench shall be excavated to a minimum width of two feet wider
than the external diameter of the pipe, to permit thorough tamping of the
material under the haunches and around the pipe. For trench depths of more than
five feet and when sheeting or shoring is required, the trench width shall be a
minimum of three feet wider than the external diameter of the pipe. The trench
shall generally be excavated so that vertical faces are maintained, except that
when authorized by the developer’s engineer and when physical conditions and
safety will permit, the sides of the trench may be sloped or benched in
accordance with OSHA’s 29 C.F.R. part 1926, subpart P, Excavation Standards.
   (B)   If these trench widths are exceeded without the written authorization
of the developer’s engineer, the pipe shall be installed with a concrete cradle
or with concrete encasement or a stronger pipe than originally specified shall
be used as authorized by the developer’s engineer.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.143 EXCAVATION BELOW GRADE.
   In cases where the excavation is carried beyond or below the lines and
grades given by the developer’s engineer, all such excavated space shall be
refilled with suitable granular material.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.144 TRENCH EXCAVATION PROTECTION.
   (A)   Open-cut trenches shall be protected in accordance with applicable
rules, laws, and regulations of federal, state, and municipal ordinances, but
shall not be less than the standards and regulations established by the
Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 C.F.R.
part 1926, Occupational Safety and Health Standards: Excavations; Final Rule,
hereinafter called OSHA.
   (B)   (1)   Protective systems may include two types:
         (a)   Structural support systems; and
         (b)   Sloping and benching excavation systems.
      (2)   No protective system shall be required for excavations occurring in
other than stable rock up to five feet in depth unless the soil has been
determined to be subject to potential cave-in based on tests and evaluations,
or unless it has been found to experience cave-in during construction. If the
excavation walls for trenches less than five feet in depth are subject to cave-
in, a protective system shall be used in conformance with §§ 20-2.08 and 20-
2.09 of the state’s Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main
Construction.
   (C)   (1)   Any trench excavation which exceeds 20 feet in depth and occurs
in other than stable rock shall make use of a protective system which is
designed and approved by a state-licensed structural engineer for a structural
support system or a state- licensed professional engineer for a sloped and
benched excavation system.
      (2)   For trench excavations occurring in other than stable rock of a
depth of 20 feet or less, the protection system provided shall conform to the
requirements of §§ 20-2.08 and 20-2.09 of the state’s Standard Specifications
for Water and Sewer Main Construction.
   (D)   Surface encumbrances that are located so as to create a hazard to
workers in the trench excavation shall be removed or supported by the
contractor.
   (E)   Ramps, runways, or ladders shall be provided for ingress and egress of
workers from trenches which exceed four feet in depth in accordance with OSHA
Standards.
   (F)   Water in trenches shall be controlled by the use of water removal
equipment. If the trench excavation interrupts the natural flow of surface
water, diversion ditches or dikes shall be used.
   (G)   When the stability of adjoining buildings, walls, sidewalks,
pavements, bridges, or other structures is endangered by excavation operations,
structural support systems such as shoring, bracing, or underpinning shall be
used to ensure the stability of the structure. Excavation below the foundation
of an adjacent structure which is not located in stable rock shall require
either of the following:
      (1)   A state-licensed professional engineer has determined that the
structure is sufficiently removed from the excavation so as to be unaffected;
or
      (2)   A state-licensed structural engineer has designed and approved a
structural support system to provide adequate protection to the structure.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.145 TRENCHES WITH SLOPING SIDES, LIMITED.
   (A)   The subdivider may, at her or his option and expense, where working
conditions and right-of-way permit, and with the approval of the developer’s
engineer, provide protection to the excavated trench by sloping and benching
the walls of the excavation, in lieu of providing a structural support system,
with the following limitations:
      (1)   Only structural support systems shall be used for protection to
excavations in traveled streets, highways, or alleys;
      (2)   Only structural support systems shall be used adjacent to streets,
highways, alleys, or sidewalls below the intersection of a one to one slope
line from the nearest face of the excavation to the edge of the pavement; and
      (3)   Only structural support systems shall be used adjacent to a
building or bridge unless a state- licensed professional engineer has
determined that the building or bridge is in no danger of being affected by the
excavation.
   (B)   When trenching with sloping sides is permitted, the slopes shall not
extend below the top of the pipe. Trench walls below the top of the pipe shall
be vertical with size and width not exceeding the specified values herein for
the size of the pipe.
   (C)   Design of sloping and benching systems shall be in conformance with
the OSHA Standard.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.146 PILING EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
   All excavated material shall be piled in a manner that will not endanger the
work and that will avoid obstructing streets, sidewalks, and driveways.
Excavated materials suitable for backfilling shall be stockpiled separately on
the site. No materials shall be placed closer than two feet to the edge of an
excavation. Fire hydrants under pressure, valve pit covers, valve boxes, curb
stop boxes, or other utility controls shall be left unobstructed and accessible
until the work is completed. Gutters shall be kept clear or other satisfactory
provisions made for street drainage. Natural watercourses shall not be
obstructed or polluted.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.147 REMOVAL OF WATER.
   At all times during construction, equipment shall be provided and maintained
to remove and properly dispose of all water entering the excavation or other
parts of the work until all work to be performed therein has been completed. No
sanitary sewer shall be used for disposal of trench water. No water containing
settleable solids shall be discharged into storm sewers. The proposed method
for the control of groundwater shall be prepared by the developer’s engineer.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.148 BARRICADES, GUARDS, AND SAFETY PROVISIONS.
   (A)   To protect persons from injury and to avoid property damage, adequate
barricades, construction signs, torches, lights, and guards as required shall
be placed and maintained at the site during the progress of the construction
work and until it is safe for traffic to use the roads and streets.
   (B)   All material piles, equipment, and pipe which may serve as
obstructions to traffic shall be enclosed by fences or barricades and shall be
protected by proper lights when the visibility is poor. The rules and
regulations of OSHA and appropriate authorities respecting safety provisions
shall be observed.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.149 STRUCTURE PROTECTION.
   Temporary support, adequate protection, and maintenance of all underground
and surface structures, drains, sewers, and other obstructions encountered in
the progress of the work shall be furnished by the subdivider. Any structures
which may have been disturbed shall be restored upon completion of the work.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.150 DEVIATIONS OCCASIONED BY STRUCTURES OR UTILITIES.
   Wherever obstructions are encountered during the progress of the work and
interfere to such an extent that an alteration in the work is required, the
developer’s engineer shall have the authority to change the drawings and order
a deviation from the line and grade or arrange with the owners of the
structures for the removal, relocation, or reconstruction of the obstructions.
Where gas, water, telephone, electrical, hot water, steam, or other existing
utilities are an impediment to the vertical or horizontal alignment of a new
pipeline, the developer’s engineer shall order a change in grade or alignment
or shall direct the subdivider to arrange with the owners of the utilities for
their removal.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.151 INTERRUPTION TO UTILITIES.
   Prior to proceeding with trench excavation, the subdivider shall contact all
utility companies in the area to aid in locating their underground services.
The subdivider shall proceed with caution in the excavation and preparation of
the trench so that the exact location of underground structures may be
determined.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.152 PIPE BEDDING.
   (A)   All pipes shall be bedded in well compacted, moist aggregate bedding
material at least four inches in depth below the pipe, placed across the entire
width of the trench and for the length of the pipe. Material for granular pipe
bedding shall be crushed limestone, washed gravel, washed sand, or other
granular material authorized by the developer’s engineer. Granular pipe bedding
shall be placed to the centerline of the rigid pipe and to one foot above the
top of the pipe for flexible pipe.
   (B)   For rigid piping (iron, concrete, steel, and the like), the granular
pipe bedding for firm, dry trench bottoms shall be crushed limestone, coarse
aggregate gradation CA 6 or CA 9 as specified in the Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction, IDOT.
   (C)   For flexible and brittle piping (plastic, clay, copper, corrugated
metal pipe, and the like), the granular pipe bedding for firm, dry trench
bottoms shall be washed sand, fine aggregate gradation FA 5 or FA 6 as
specified in the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
IDOT.
   (D)   PVC sewer pipe shall be bedded and backfilled in general accordance
with Underground Installation of Flexible Thermoplastic Sewer Pipe, ASTM
Standard D-2321. The embedment materials shall be Class III.
   (E)   When unsuitable soil conditions are encountered in the bottom of the
trench, the contractor shall remove unsuitable materials below the depth of the
bedding shown on the drawings, and shall replace the material removed with
compacted pipe bedding materials authorized by the developer’s engineer.
   (F)   In cases where excessively wet conditions exist on the trench bottom,
stone larger than those listed hereinabove (coarse aggregate gradation CA 1 as
specified in the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction,
IDOT) may be used as ballast to stabilize the bottom; however, the pipe shall
not be laid on this large aggregate. Granular pipe bedding is required between
the larger aggregate and the pipe.
   (G)   As soon as the condition of the pipe will permit, the entire width of
the trench shall be backfilled with moist aggregate to the heights stated
above. The aggregate shall be placed longitudinally along the pipe. The
elevation of the haunching material on each side of the pipe shall be the same.
Special care shall be taken to completely fill the space under the pipe
haunches. The aggregate materials shall be placed in maximum six-inch layers,
loose measurement, and compacted by ramming or tamping.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.153 CONCRETE CRADLE.
   Where, in the opinion of the developer’s engineer or the village’s
Maintenance Superintendent, subgrade conditions warrant extra precautions for
the bedding of pipe, the developer’s engineer or the village’s Maintenance
Superintendent may order the construction of a concrete cradle to support the
pipe. The cradle shall be constructed as directed by the developer’s engineer.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.16)
§ 153.154 BACKFILL.
   (A)   Rigid pipe may be broadly defined as that which does not depend on
side support from trench backfill for its structural integrity (e.g., iron,
steel, or concrete pipe). Rigid pipe shall be bedded with granular pipe bedding
up to the horizontal centerline of the pipe. Backfill from the horizontal
centerline to a level of one foot above the top of the pipe (initial backfill)
shall be either of granular backfill or excavated earthen materials.
   (B)   Flexible pipe may be broadly defined as that which does depend on side
support from trench backfill for its structural integrity (e.g., solid wall
ABS, PE, PVC pipe, ABS composite pipe, or corrugated metal pipe). All flexible
pipe shall be backfilled with granular pipe bedding to a level one foot above
the top of the pipe (initial backfill). Clay pipe is included in this “flexible
pipe” category so graded sand will be used for granular pipe bedding and
granular backfill in pipe trenches when installing clay pipe.
   (C)   Initial backfill materials (up to a height of 12 inches above the
pipe) shall be free from rocks and frozen material and shall be carefully
deposited in uniform layers not exceeding six inches thick, loose measure. The
filling of the trench shall be carried on simultaneously on both sides of the
pipe in such a manner that damage to the pipe or injurious side pressures do
not occur. The material in each layer shall be firmly compacted by ramming or
tamping, to the same requirements set forth for bedding. Do not use compaction
equipment directly over the pipe until sufficient backfill has been placed to
ensure that such equipment will not damage or disturb the pipe.
   (D)   Methods for backfilling above the pipe bedding are outlined as
follows.
      (1)   Method I. This method applies to pipes installed under yards and
unimproved areas. In this method, the trench shall be backfilled with
originally excavated materials in a manner which will not dislodge or damage
the pipe or cause bridging action in the trench. The material shall be
deposited in uniform layers not exceeding 12 inches thick, loose measure. Each
layer shall be compacted by ramming or tamping or, if directed by the
developer’s engineer, shall be inundated or deposited with water. If water
jetting is used, it shall be considered incidental to piping installation and
no additional compensation will be allowed. The top of the trench shall be left
neatly rounded to allow for settlement. The top four inches shall be topsoil.
Any rocks or clods greater than two inches in diameter shall be removed from
the topsoil as it is spread.
      (2)   Method II. This method applies to all pipes installed in all alleys
or parking areas which do not have permanent surfaces or oil and chip surfaces.
In this method, the trench from the top of the granular pipe bedding to eight
inches below the ground surface shall be backfilled with granular backfill.
Then eight inches of temporary aggregate surface course, Type B, gradation CA 6
or CA 9, as specified in the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction, IDOT, shall be applied so that the finished surface of the
aggregate is at the new elevation or matches the existing surface elevation.
The temporary materials shall be removed as necessary during the final roadway
construction.
      (3)   Method III. This method applies to all pipes installed beneath
existing utilities or structures. In this case, the trench from the top of the
granular pipe bedding to at least six inches above the existing utility or
structure shall be backfilled with granular backfill. The granular material
shall be deposited in uniform layers not exceeding six inches thick, loose
measure, and each layer shall be compacted by ramming or tamping. The trench
from six inches above the existing utility or structure to the surface shall
then be backfilled in accordance with another applicable method; I; II; IV; V;
or VI.
      (4)   Method IV. This method applies to all pipes installed in any area
where the existing or new surface is portland cement concrete. In this case,
the trench from the top of the granular pipe bedding to the bottom of the
existing or proposed surface shall be backfilled with granular backfill.
      (5)   Method V. This method applies to all pipes installed beneath oil
and chip driveways or streets or bituminous concrete surfaces and all other
driveways or streets not covered by Method II. In this case, the trench from
the top of the granular pipe bedding to 12 inches below the surface shall be
backfilled with granular backfill. The top 12 inches of the trench shall be
temporary aggregate surface course, Type B, CA 6 or CA 9 gradation. The
temporary materials shall be removed as necessary during the final roadway
construction.
      (6)   Method VI. This method applies to all pipes installed in cultivated
fields. The backfill shall be placed as in Method I except that no excavated
material shall be allowed within the upper zone originally occupied by topsoil.
After the backfill reaches the approximate lower limit of the original topsoil
zone, the stockpiled topsoil shall be spread in such a manner that natural
settlement will not result in a depression along the sewer route. All rocks and
boulders greater than two inches in diameter shall be removed from the topsoil
as it is spread.
      (7)   Method VII. This method applies to all pipes constructed in earthen
berms. From the top of the pipe bedding to 12 inches below the proposed finish
grade, the trench shall be backfilled with Class A compacted select excavation
materials in eight-inch layers. The top 12 inches shall be filled with topsoil.

gradation CA 6, CA 9, or CA 13 as specified in the Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction, IDOT. Granular backfill for flexible pipe shall
be fine aggregate gradation FA 5 or FA 6 as specified in the Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, IDOT.
      (3)   Materials for granular backfill shall consist of washed sand, stone
sand, crushed stone, pit run, or crushed gravel. Granular backfill shall be
reasonably free from an excess of soft and unsound particles and other
objectionable matter. Granular materials from local deposits, graded to the
limits specified above, and authorized by the developer’s engineer, may be used
for granular backfill. At the time of use, the granular backfill shall be free
of frozen lumps and foreign materials that may have become mixed with it during
handling.
   (G)   (1)   Where water jetting is called for, all trench backfill shall be
compacted by jetting and water-soaking in the manner described below. The
trench compaction shall be started at the point of lowest elevation of the
trench and work up along the trench. Jetting and water-soaking shall not begin
until the trench has been backfilled to within six inches of the finished
surface.
      (2)   The holes through which water is injected into the backfill shall
be centered over the trench backfill and at longitudinal intervals of not more
than six feet. Additional holes shall be provided if deemed necessary by the
developer’s engineer to secure adequate settlement. All holes shall be jetted
and shall be carried to a point one foot above the top of the pipe. Drilling
the holes by means of augers or other mechanical means will not be permitted.
Care shall be taken in jetting so to prevent direct contact with, or other
disturbances of the pipe. No more than 100 linear feet of completed pipeline
shall remain unjetted at any one time.
      (3)   The water shall be injected at a pressure and rate just sufficient
to sink the holes at a moderate rate. After a hole has been jetted to the
required depth, the water shall continue to be injected until it begins to
overflow the surface. The subdivider shall bore test holes at such locations as
the developer’s engineer may designate in order to determine the effectiveness
of the water soaking. A soil auger shall be used for boring test holes. As soon
as the jetting and water soaking has been completed, all holes shall be filled
with soil and compacted. Surface depressions resulting from backfill subsidence
caused by jetting and water soaking shall be filled and recompacted by tamping
or rolling to the satisfaction of the developer’s engineer.
      (4)   Water shall be furnished at the subdivider’s expense. The
subdivider shall use water only at those times designated by the village, and
its use shall conform to municipal ordinances, rules, or regulations.
   (H)   Where there is a deficiency of suitable backfill material due to a
rejection of part or all of the excavated material as unsatisfactory for
backfill purposes, the contractor shall furnish satisfactory backfill material
wasted from trench excavation in other locations or from other sources.

pipe by deflections at the joints for most rigid pipes and in the pipe for most
flexible pipes. If shorter lengths are required, the drawings will indicate
maximum lengths that can be used.
   (G)   Where field conditions require deflection of curves not anticipated by
the drawings, the developer’s engineer will determine the methods to be used.
Maximum deflections at pipe joints and laying radius for the various pipe
lengths shall be as recommended by the pipe manufacturer or stated in
applicable AWWA Standards. When rubber gasketing pipe is laid on a curve, the
pipe shall be jointed in a straight alignment and then deflected to the curved
alignment. Trenches shall be made wider on curves for this purpose.

top section two inches above ultimate final grade of the ground, with a maximum
deviation of two inches in elevation being allowed.
      (2)   Each hydrant shall be connected to the main with a six-inch or
larger diameter branch controlled by an independent valve. The valve shall be
restrained to allow shut-off when the hydrant is to be removed. All hydrants
and hydrant leads shall have restrained joints from the main to the hydrant
including the connection to the main and the hydrant foot.
   (M)   Drainage shall be provided at the base of the hydrant by placing
coarse gravel from the bottom of the trench to at least six inches above the
waste opening in the hydrant and to a distance of one foot around the elbow.
The surface of the coarse gravel shall be covered with geotextile filter fabric
to prevent soil intrusion into the stone. Adequate support must be provided to
prevent the fire hydrant from settling. The bowl of each hydrant shall be well
braced against a sufficient area of unexcavated earth at the end of the trench
with concrete thrust blocks.
   (N)   New watermains and appurtenances shall be connected to the existing
piping in accordance with the details shown on the drawings. If the existing
piping can be isolated from the system, the connections shall be made by using
cutting-in-sleeves in the existing piping. If the existing watermains cannot be
isolated from the system, the connections shall be made under pressure using
tapping sleeves and tapping valves.
   (O)   Where the connection of a new watermain or appurtenance requires
interruption of service and notification of customers affected, the village’s
maintenance superintendent and subdivider shall mutually agree upon a date and
time for the connections to be made. The date and time will allow ample time
for the subdivider to assemble the labor and materials and for the village to
notify all customers affected.

§ 153.173 TESTING WATERMAINS.
   (A)   The subdivider shall be responsible for and pay all costs associated
with testing pressure mains. After a section of pipe has been laid and partly
backfilled, all newly laid pipe or any valved sections of it shall be subjected
to a hydrostatic pressure equal to 50% more than the operating pressure at the
lowest elevation of the pipe section, but not to exceed the pressure rating of
the type of pipe specified or the thrust-restraint design pressure. The test
pressure shall not vary by more than five psi for the duration of the test.
Each pressure test shall be not less than one hour and the contractor shall
allow the system to stabilize at the test pressure before conducting a leakage
test. The basic provisions of AWWA Standard C-600, Installation of Ductile-Iron
Water Mains and Their Appurtenances, shall apply.
   (B)   Each section of pipe to be tested (at no more than 1,000-foot
intervals), as determined by the developer’s engineer, shall be slowly filled
with water and the specified test pressure shall be applied by means of a pump
connected to the pipe in a satisfactory manner. The pump, pipe connection, and
all necessary apparatus including gauges and meters shall be furnished by the
contractor. Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be
expelled from the pipe and valves. When hydrants are in the test section, the
test shall be made against closed hydrant valves. To accomplish this, taps
shall be made, if necessary, at points of highest elevation and afterwards
tightly plugged. Any damaged or defective pipes, fittings, valves, or hydrants
discovered in consequence of this pressure test shall be removed and replaced
by the subdivider and the test shall be repeated until satisfactory to the
Village Engineer.
   (C)   The developer’s engineer and a representative from the village shall
witness each test. The developer’s engineer shall record the results of each
test, state whether the results were satisfactory or not, and have all who
witnessed the test sign these report.
   (D)   During the pressure test, a leakage test shall be conducted to
determine the quantity of water lost by leakage under the specified test
pressure. The subdivider shall be responsible for and pay all costs associated
with leakage testing. LEAKAGE shall be defined as the quantity of water that
must be supplied into newly laid pipe or any valved section thereof to maintain
pressure within five psi of the test pressure after the pipe has been filled
with water and the air has been expelled. Leakage shall not be measured by a
drop in pressure in a test section over a period of time. Duration of each
leakage test shall be a minimum of one hour in addition to the pressure test
period.
   (E)   (1)   The maximum allowable leakage in gallons per hour for a pipeline
shall not exceed that amount determined by the formula:
 

L= (N * D * square root of P) / 7400
 
where:
   L= Allowable leakage in gallons per hour
   N= Number of joints in the length of pipeline tested
   D= Nominal diameter of the pipe in inches
and    P= Average test pressure during leakage test, in psig
 
      (2)   When testing against closed metal-seated valves, an additional
leakage per closed valve of .0078 gph per inch of nominal valve size shall be
allowed.
   (F)   Acceptance of a section of watermain shall be determined on the basis
of allowable leakage. If any test of laid pipe discloses leakage greater than
that specified above, the subdivider shall locate and make repairs as necessary
until the leakage is within the specified allowance.
   (G)   The developer’s engineer and a representative of the village shall
witness these tests. The developer’s engineer shall record the results of these
tests, state whether the results were satisfactory or not, and have all who
witnessed the test sign these reports.

§ 153.174 DISINFECTION OF WATERMAINS.
   (A)   Disinfection of all potable watermains shall be conducted in general
accordance with Disinfecting Water Mains, AWWA Standards and applicable state
statues, codes and administrative rules. The subdivider shall be responsible
for and pay all costs associated with watermain disinfection. Satisfactory
disinfection is demonstrated when two consecutive water samples collected from
the completed project at least 24 hours apart indicated no bacterial growths as
measured by the membrane filter technique or no tubes positive as measured by
the presumptive test, fermentation tube method.
   (B)   All new watermains shall be satisfactorily disinfected prior to use.
All new community water supplies shall collect two consecutive representative
samples at least 24 hours apart and receive satisfactory results from the
analyses before an operating permit will be issued.
   (C)   The requirement for collecting two consecutive samples may be modified
for watermain construction projects at existing community water supplies
practicing chlorination in accordance with standards and applicable state
statutes, codes and administrative rules. Water supplies practicing adequate
chlorination are required to collect only one satisfactory sample set before
issuance of the operating permit provided adequate chlorine residual is present
at the point of connection.
   (D)   Adequate chlorine residuals exist in a distribution system when there
is a minimum on 0.2 mg/l free chlorine residual for water supplies practicing
free chlorination of .05 mg/l combined chlorine residual for water supplies
practicing combined chlorination. Projects in these supplies shall be
considered satisfactorily disinfected if one water sample set indicates no
bacteria.
   (E)   If the analyses indicate the presence of contamination, resampling at
the sampling point indication contamination is required and results pursuant to
the requirement of this section shall be obtained.
   (F)   Analyses of these samples shall be performed by an agency laboratory
or another certified laboratory. The operating permit application shall be sent
to the Division of Public Water Supplies Permit Section at the same time as the
water samples are sent to the agency laboratory. The laboratory report sheets
shall be submitted with the completed operating permit application if another
certified laboratory is used.

§ 153.189 CONSTRUCTION.
   All construction shall be in accordance with §§
153.140 through
153.159 and
153.185 through
153.190, the IEPA regulations, and the following additional requirements:
   (A)   All gravity sewer pipe shall be laid to conform to the prescribed line
and grade shown on the drawings by using a laser. The subdivider shall
constantly check line and grade of the laser beam and the pipe, and in the
event they do not meet the elevations and grades shown on the drawings, the
subdivider shall stop the work and notify the developer’s engineer, remedy the
cause, and re-lay any pipe installed at improper grade or elevations. Minimum
cover shall be four feet from finished grade to the top of the pipe for gravity
sewers or forcemain. Special structural protection shall be provided for cases
where there is less than minimum cover.
   (B)   Laying of pipe shall be accomplished to line and grade in the trench
only after it has been dewatered and the foundation and/or bedding has been
prepared. Mud, silt, gravel, and other foreign material shall be kept out of
the pipe and off the jointing surfaces. Dewatering sufficient to maintain the
water level at or below the surface of trench bottom or base of the bedding
course, shall be accomplished prior to pipe laying and jointing, if not prior
to excavation and placing of the bedding. The dewatering operation, however
accomplished, shall be carried out so that it does not destroy or weaken the
strength of the soil under or alongside the trench. The normal water table
shall be restored to its natural level in such a manner as to not disturb the
pipe and its foundation.
   (C)   All pipe laid shall be retained in position so as to maintain
alignment and joint closure until sufficient backfill has been completed to
adequately hold the pipe in place. The pipe shall be laid up grade from point
of connection on the existing pipe or from a designated starting point. The
pipe shall be installed with the “female” end upgrade, unless authorized
otherwise. When pipe laying is not in progress, the forward end of the pipe
shall be kept tightly closed with a temporary plug.
   (D)   Pipe bedding shall be placed so that the entire length of the pipe
will have full bearing.
   (E)   Plugs for pipe branches, stubs, or other open ends which are not to be
immediately connected shall be made of an authorized material and shall be
secured in place with a joint comparable to the main line joint. Stoppers may
be of an integrally cast breakout design.
   (F)   No existing pipe shall be connected to a new pipe unless specifically
authorized in each instance by the Village Engineer. Storm drains and drain
tiles shall not be connected to a wastewater sewer.
   (G)   The subdivider shall install service sewers (laterals) where and as
shown on the drawings. Excavation, backfill, restoration of surfaces, and the
laying of service sewers (laterals) shall be the same as for the mainline
gravity sewers. The subdivider shall connect the service sewers (laterals) to
the mainline gravity sewer by either a service riser and service wye, only a
service wye, or at a manhole stub. If required, the subdivider shall also make
the four-inch diameter building sewer connections to the six-inch diameter
service sewers (laterals).
   (H)   Existing sewers severed during any excavation shall be repaired by
replacing them with ductile-iron pipe of the same inside diameter. The ends of
the ductile-iron pipe shall be joined to the existing pipe on each side of the
trench by the method illustrated on the drawings.
   (I)   Pipes shall be jointed as recommended by the pipe manufacturer.
Dissimilar pipes shall be jointed with suitable adapter couplings and concrete
encasement, unless otherwise authorized by the developer’s engineer.
   (J)   (1)   Where the depth of the sewer invert is greater than seven feet
below the surface of the ground, a service riser shall be constructed to an
elevation of seven feet below the ground elevation. In some locations, seven
feet of depth may be too shallow to serve basements. As other locations wyes
may have to be installed so that the spur is at right angles to the vertical
plane through the centerline of the sewer.
      (2)   The subdivider shall be responsible for closely checking the
basement elevations along with the distance from the new mainline sewer to the
building to be served and shall install the spur of the wye, or the top of the
riser, or the end of the lateral (whichever applies) at a low enough elevation
to permit the six-inch diameter service sewer to be installed at a one-eighth
of an inch per foot grade and still have the flowline of the upstream end of
the building sewer at least one foot below the basement elevation. In no case
shall the top of the riser be less than seven feet below the ground surface.
      (3)   The service riser shall be constructed with a six-inch wye placed
to receive the six-inch riser or lateral. The riser pipe shall extend to the
elevation as hereinabove determined. The wye, or wye and riser combination,
shall be installed and bedded as shown on the drawings.
      (4)   Six-inch laterals shall be constructed from the tee branch and
riser to five feet beyond the property line of the lot to be served, or to the
location shown on the drawings, and shall terminate with a manufactured
temporary plug. In many cases these laterals will have to be constructed across
streets, alleys, sidewalks, and easements to reach the property line.
      (5)   Prior to backfilling, the subdivider shall place a two-inch by two-
inch stake at the end of the riser or lateral, perpendicular to the horizontal
plane through the center line of the pipe and extending at least 18 inches
above the top of the pipe. Care shall be taken while backfilling to insure the
stake remains vertical. The purpose of said stake is to serve breakage of the
pipe during house hook-ups. After backfilling, a second two-inch by two-inch
stake having a minimum length of 18 inches shall be driven into the ground
surface at the end of the riser or lateral as a visual indicator of the
location of the service. The stake shall extend six inches above the ground
surface and shall be painted with orange and red fluorescent paint.
   (K)   Whenever shown on the drawings, the subdivider shall connect service
sewers and risers (six-inch diameter) to the new mainline sewers by core
drilling a six-inch diameter hole in the pipe wall, installing a cast iron tee
saddle on the sanitary sewer and connecting the service sewer to the tee. Care
must be taken in ordering tee saddles so they are compatible with both the
mainline sewer pipe type and the brand of service sewer pipe being used.
   (L)   (1)   The base section shall be placed on a compacted granular bedding
not less than six inches thick and extending to the limits of the excavation.
The bedding shall be smooth and level to assure uniform contact and support of
the manhole base. The manhole base and fillet may be cast monolithically with
the bottom barrel section of the manhole.
      (2)   All lift holes shall be completely filled with non-shrink grout and
the exterior coated with a layer of waterproofing paint prior to backfilling.
All void spaces on the inside and outside of manhole joints shall be filled
with non-shrink grout.
      (3)   For manhole joints that will be subject to a constant hydrostatic
pressure, an external rubber seal with metal bands shall be placed around the
joints in the barrel section.
      (4)   Blockouts (within the manholes at the fillets) used to install the
rubber pipe gaskets shall be filled with concrete to the centerline of the
influent and/or effluent piping.
      (5)   After all sewers have been connected to the manhole, a concrete
fillet shall be constructed in the bottom of the manhole as shown in the
details on the drawings. Placement of the fillets shall be prior to placement
of the manhole flat tops and/or frames and grates.
      (6)   Castings placed on concrete or masonry surfaces shall be set in
full mortar beds. Castings shall be set accurately to the finished elevation so
that no subsequent adjustment will be necessary.
      (7)   Manholes shall be famished with a one-half-inch diameter pipe
nipple ten inches long with a cap extending through the manhole wall and
located at the top of the sewer pipe or by an alternative method authorized by
the Village Engineer to assist in determining the level of the ambient water
table.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.18)
§ 153.190 TESTING.
   (A)   All wastewater sewers shall be tested for leakage using the
infiltration test if the watertable is 24 inches or higher above the crown of
the pipe, and the exfiltration by water test will be used if the water table is
less than 24 inches above the crown of the pipe. If authorized by the
developer’s engineer, pressure air testing of the sewers may be used only if
conditions do not permit testing by infiltration or exfiltration by water. PVC
sewer pipe shall also be tested for deflection.
   (B)   All sewers shall be lamped, and shall shown at least three-fourths of
the cross-sectional area of the pipe between adjacent manholes. All sewers not
passing the lamping test shall be considered unsatisfactory and shall be
repaired by the subdivider.
   (C)   Any sewer not passing the tests required in divisions (A) and (B)
above shall be deemed unacceptable and shall be properly repaired by the
subdivider and retested until such time as the sewer passes these required
tests.
   (D)   The maximum section to be tested shall be between adjacent manholes.
The developer’s engineer shall determine what the testing section lengths shall
be. The subdivider will be advised of the results of all tests performed as a
guide to her or his operation.
   (E)   The subdivider shall flush all sewers with water sufficient in volume
to obtain free flow through each line. Flushing water and debris shall not
enter any pump station wet well. Water will be pumped from the sewer system
during flushing to a discharge location authorized by the developer’s engineer.
A visual inspection shall be made and all obstructions removed and defects
corrected. The subdivider shall cooperate with the Village Engineer in the
performance of leakage and exfiltration tests on all sections of sewer after
backfilling. The subdivider shall supply all materials, equipment, and labor
necessary to complete the testing requirements. The subdivider is also
responsible for the disposal of flow from the pipe, or trench upstream from the
pipe, or trench upstream from the section being tested, for a period of not
more than eight hours for each test performed. Tests will be performed in such
manner and at such times as to cause the least possible hindrance to the
progress of work.
   (F)   (1)   Infiltration method. The section of sewer to be tested shall
have been backfilled and a check made to insure the water level in the trench
is a minimum of 24 inches over the crown of the sewer pipe. Infiltration flow
shall be measured by a 90- degree V-notch weir with free fall discharge or
other means acceptable to the Village Engineer. Infiltration leakage shall not
exceed 200 gallons per inch of pipe diameter per mile per day of sewer pipe,
including manholes in the test section.
      (2)   Exfiltration method. The section of sewer to be tested shall be
sealed by inserting inflatable rubber bags in the pipes or by other means, and
then water shall be introduced into a manhole until the section is completely
filled. The subdivider shall fill the pipe to the test level eight hours prior
to the time of exfiltration testing to permit normal absorption into the pipe
walls. Throughout the test period of at least one hour, the water level in the
upper manhole shall be maintained at least 24 inches above the crown at the
upper end of the pipe or at least 24 inches above the groundwater table,
whichever is higher. The length of pipe tested shall be limited so that the
pressure on the centerline of the lower end of the section tested shall not
exceed six feet of water column. Exfiltration leakage shall not exceed 240
gallons per inch of pipe diameter per mile per day of sewer pipe, including
manholes in the test section.

industrial, the developer may provide for storage and controlled release of
stormwater runoff for the developed lots by sufficient and enforceable covenant
upon the individual lots. The covenant shall require construction of on-site
stormwater detention facilities upon each lot at the time of subsequent
development of that lot.
   (E)   The Rational Method, USDA Soil Conservation Service (SCS) TR-55
Method, Mannings equation, or other similar recognized methods may be used to

development.
   (H)   Existing easements for any agricultural drainage tile located within
development sites shall be preserved. If no easement exists, an easement shall
be granted for access and maintenance of the tile drain. Such easements shall
be of sufficient width and located to provide for continued functioning and
necessary maintenance of drainage facilities. No buildings or permanent

(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.19)
§ 153.211 STORMWATER DETENTION.
   (A)   When the maximum controlled stormwater runoff rate would be exceeded
upon the development, redevelopment, or new construction on the subdivider’s
land, stormwater storage methods shall be provided and constructed by the
subdivider.
   (B)   The maximum controlled release rate for 50-year precipitation event
for each independent watershed area within the subdivider’s land shall be equal
to the peak rate of discharge from the area prior to development in a five-year
return frequency precipitation event. The release rate shall be as determined
by the Rational Method, TR-55 Method, or other method acceptable to the Village
Engineer.
   (C)   Stormwater runoff from upstream off-site areas shall be directed
around the stormwater storage area. However, when pass-through conditions are
deemed necessary, the maximum controlled release rate for each independent
watershed area within the subdivider’s land shall be determined in the
following manner.
      (1)   For that portion of the watershed outside of a subdivider’s land,
the peak rate of runoff which would have occurred for a 50-year return period
storm under the state of development existing just prior to application for
development of a subdivider’s land shall be calculated and determined.
      (2)   For that portion of the watershed within the lands of the
subdivider, the peak rate of runoff which would have occurred for a five-year
return period storm under a state of traditional agricultural usage shall be
calculated and determined.
      (3)   The maximum controlled release rate for each independent watershed
area within the subdivider’s land as it exits the subdivider’s land for storms
up to and including the 50-year return period storm shall be the sum of
divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above.
   (D)   The maximum controlled release rate for small developments with a
total watershed area of five acres or less may be assumed to be 0.50 cfs per
acre if the subdivider chooses to utilize the Direct Method of Calculating
Required Storage for Small Developments, as outlined in (F)(4) below.
   (E)   The village may consider or require reduced release rates under
certain circumstances:
      (1)   In the event that the downstream stormwater runoff drainage system
is inadequate to accommodate the maximum release rate provided above, then the
village, at its option, may reduce the allowable release rate to that rate
permitted by the capacity of the receiving stormwater runoff drainage system
and additional storage may be required to store that portion of the runoff
exceeding the capacity of the receiving stormwater runoff drainage system. When
the village exercises this option, the subdivider and village shall pay a
proportional share of the costs of the storage, as mutually determined by the
village and the subdivider; and
      (2)   In the event that the stormwater runoff control can be provided
exceeding the requirements of this chapter and the benefit of this additional
control would accrue to the village at large, the village may participate in
the increased cost of the control of stormwater runoff in proportion to the
additional benefits derived therefrom.
   (F)   The volume of required stormwater storage shall be calculated on the
basis of the maximum value achieved from the runoff of a design event less the
volume of water released through the outlet structure. The following standards
shall apply to watersheds of various sizes:
      (1)   Standard reservoir routing methods shall be utilized to determine
the required storage volume. SCS TR-55 or TR-20 methodologies shall be utilized
to develop hydrographs of the stormwater runoff for the site. Stage/storage/
discharge relationships shall be developed for the detention basin utilizing
standard engineering methods and utilized to route the hydrographs through the
stormwater detention facility;
      (2)   SCS TR-55 methods may be utilized to calculate the required storage
volume for developments with watershed areas of less than 25 acres and which do
not involve significant off-site drainage that must be passed through the
detention basin;
      (3)   (a)   The modified rational method may be utilized to calculate
required storage volume for developments with watershed areas of less than 25
acres and which do not involve significant off-site drainage that must be
passed through the detention basin;
         (b)   Time of concentration shall be estimated utilizing SCS TR-55
methods for developed conditions. “C” values utilized shall be set at 125% of
“normal” five-year storm values to account for reduced soil infiltration
capabilities during large storm events, up to a maximum “C” value of 1.0. In
determining the volume of storage required when using the modified rational
method, the release rate utilized in the calculations is equal to the release
rate through the outlet structure when one-half of the storage volume is
filled; and
         (c)   When using the modified rational method the critical storm
duration (that requiring the largest detention volume) for any design event
shall be identified and used in determining storage volume; and
      (4)   For small developments with a total watershed area of less than
five acres, the total volume of stormwater storage required may be determined
by the direct method, which does not required hydrologic analyses. When the
direct method is utilized, the total storage volume provided shall be equal to
two and one-half inches of water over the watershed area.
   (G)   An outlet structure shall be provided to discharge water from the
basin at the design outlet controlled rate previously specified in divisions
(B) and (C) above.
   (H)   Each stormwater storage facility shall also be provided with a means
of emergency overflow. This emergency overflow structure shall be constructed
to function without special maintenance attention and can become a part of the
excess stormwater passageway for the entire development. The emergency overflow
structure shall be capable of passing the 100-year return period storm event
flow.
   (I)   The entire stormwater storage facility shall be designed and
constructed to fully protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The
minimum building site elevation adjacent to stormwater detention basins shall
be set at least two feet above the maximum created head during the 100-year
return period storm event. The maximum created head will include the energy
head at the emergency overflow structure.
   (J)   Stormwater detention basins shall be provided with a freeboard of not
less than two feet above the water surface elevation that is anticipated to
occur during the 50-year return period storm event. The freeboard shall not be
overtopped during the 100-year return period storm event.
   (K)   (1)   Stormwater storage facilities shall not receive runoff from
tributary areas outside the development site unless the Village Engineer
determines that runoff from such areas can be accommodated in the storage area
in a manner that will protect immediate downstream properties. In making this
determination, the Village Engineer may require the subdivider’s engineer to
provide additional data or calculations.
      (2)   When stormwater runoff from tributary areas outside of the
development cannot reasonably be directed around the stormwater storage area,
the Village Engineer may allow the use of staged release outlet structures,
which allow stormwater runoff from off-site areas to pass through the
stormwater storage area undetained, while simultaneously detaining and
providing controlled release for the volume of excess stormwater runoff from
the site.
   (L)   Where portions of the subdivider’s land are tributary to the same
drain for an outlet, but which are within two or more tributary areas to that
drain, the subdivider may construct, upon site-specific authorization of the
Village Engineer, compensatory stormwater detention facilities within one
tributary area which offsets the lack of construction of stormwater detention
facilities in another tributary area. Such compensatory storage shall be
designed and constructed such that the net effect of the facilities shall be to
limit the rate at which stormwater runoff is released into the drain to that
rate which would have occurred had stormwater detention been constructed for
all tributary areas.
   (M)   Stormwater storage areas may be planned and constructed jointly by two
or more landowners provided the provisions of this chapter are met. Adequate
easements and provisions for future maintenance by the landowners must be
provided.
   (N)   Where stormwater detention, retention, or depressional storage areas
are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be
constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork for the development.
Any eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the
applicant before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of
the facilities.
   (O)   Construction of impervious surfaces shall not begin until the
developer’s engineer has certified in writing to the Plat Officer that the
necessary detention facilities are in place and operational. The Village
Engineer or the Maintenance Superintendent may conduct periodic inspections of
the work in progress to be certain that the drainage system is being
constructed as designed.

clogging from crop residuals.
   (D)   Subsurface low flow conduits shall be provided in dry bottom
stormwater storage basins. These conduits shall be constructed to reduce the
frequency of time that the storage area will be covered with water and shall
facilitate dewatering of the soils in the stormwater storage area to avoid
saturated soil conditions. Low flow conduits shall be designed to intercept
trickle flows from storm sewers and other drainage facilities which outlet into
the basin. Low flow conduits shall not be less than eight inches in diameter.
Tile underdrain systems may be combined with the low flow conduits.
   (E)   Pipe outlets of less than eight inches in diameter shall not be
allowed. Multiple outlet pipes from a stormwater storage area shall be avoided
if they are designed to be less than 12 inches in diameter.
   (F)   Seeding, silt fencing, straw bale dikes, or other soil stabilization
measures shall be established in the stormwater storage area immediately
following construction. During construction of the overall development,
sediment may buildup in the storage area due to erosion. All sediment shall be
removed before construction is considered completed.
   (G)   Permanent erosion control measures such as mulching, hydroseeding,
conventional seeding, nurse crops, fertilizing, or sod installation shall be
utilized to control soil movement and erosion within the storage area. The
subdivider is referred to §
153.099. The installation of these permanent measures shall take place only
after the majority of construction and other silt and sediment producing
activities have been completed.
   (H)   Adequate impact stilling basins shall be provided at the downstream
side of any outlet structure to ensure that downstream soil erosion is
mitigated and the regime of the downstream drainage facility is not disturbed.
   (I)   The maximum planned depth of stormwater stored shall not exceed six
feet.
   (J)   Tile underdrains shall be provided for all detention basins serving a
watershed area of more than five acres, and for all detention basins located in
soils with groundwater elevations of less than three feet below ground surface.
Tile underdrains shall be constructed so that they shall facilitate dewatering
of the soils in the stormwater storage area to avoid marshy or saturated soil
conditions, and may be combined with the low flow conduits.

   (A)   Wet bottom stormwater storage facilities shall be designed in
compliance with all regulations which govern the construction of dry bottom
stormwater storage facilities, and the following additional regulations.
   (B)   The water surface area of the permanent pool shall not exceed one-
fifth of the area of the tributary watershed, or as authorized by the Village
Engineer.
   (C)   Minimum normal water depth (excluding safety ledges and side slopes)

point, four feet below the normal pool water surface. Below the four-foot
depth, the side slopes shall not be steeper than the stable angle of repose
under saturated conditions of the soil material in the basin.
   (F)   Facilities shall be provided to lower the pond elevation at least
three feet for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance.
   (G)   Warning signs shall be placed at appropriate locations to warn of deep
water, possible flood conditions during storm periods, and of other dangers
that exist to pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (H)   Protection of the shoreline shall be provided to alleviate soil
erosion due to wave action.
   (I)   The volume of water permanently stored therein shall not be considered
to be a part of the required excess stormwater storage.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.19)
§ 153.214 ALTERNATIVE STORMWATER STORAGE AREAS.
   (A)   The use of stormwater storage facilities described in §§
153.207 and
153.208 are the preferred means of stormwater storage. The following
alternative means of stormwater storage may be used on sites under two acres in
area or where practical necessity makes the use of stormwater storage areas
infeasible. The use of such alternative areas is only permitted upon the
approval of the Board of Trustees.
   (B)   Design and construction of the pavement and structural elements must
assure that there is minimal damage due to flooding. Control structures must be
readily accessible for maintenance and cleaning. Flow control devices will be
required.
   (C)   No stormwater detention shall be located upon street pavements. Street
pavement surface ponding shall not exceed nine inches in depth in the gutter
line under all rainfall conditions up to and including the 50-year storm event.
Open waterways such as surface overflow swales shall be designed into the
grading plan to receive all excess stormwater runoff. Depressing sidewalks
across such overflow swales to meet this requirement shall be acceptable.
Street ponding shall be allowed only for the conveyance of excess stormwater
runoff.
   (D)   Parking lots may be designed to provide temporary detention storage on
a portion of their surfaces. These lots may be constructed to store water to a
depth of 0.6 feet and these areas must be located in the most remote, least
used areas of the parking facility. Designs must ensure minimal damage to the
parking facilities and warning signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations
to warn of possible flood conditions during storm periods.
   (E)   Underground storage facilities must be designed for easy access in
order to remove accumulated sediment and debris. These facilities must have a
positive gravity outlet unless otherwise authorized by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.19)
§ 153.215 MAINTENANCE OF PRIVATELY OWNED FACILITIES.
   (A)   Maintenance of stormwater storage facilities located on private
property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before any
plat is approved by the Board of Trustees, the owner shall ensure that the
covenants placed upon the property guarantee that the owner and all future
owners of the property have sufficient funds to maintain and will maintain its
stormwater drainage system. The covenants shall specifically authorize
representatives from the village to enter onto the property for the purpose of
inspection and maintenance of the drainage system. The covenants shall also
include a schedule for regular maintenance of each aspect of the property’s
stormwater drainage system.
   (B)   In the event that an inspection by the village reveals that the
private stormwater drainage facilities are not properly maintained, the village
may require that proper maintenance be performed. The village’s Maintenance
Superintendent shall notify the property owner to begin any necessary
corrections. If the corrections are not made within the time period determined
by the Board of Trustees, the village may have the necessary work completed and
assess all the costs to the owner, in a manner designated by the Village
Attorney.
   (C)   The owner may, after approval by the Board, assign the owner’s
maintenance responsibilities and duties under the terms of the covenants to a
third party, such as a property owner’s association or other competent agency.
When such assignment is made, the entity undertaking the maintenance
responsibility shall show evidence of financial ability to provide any
maintenance required.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.19)
§ 153.216 WATER OUTLETS.
   (A)   Dry weather water outlets are prohibited from discharging directly
onto any public property, public right-of-way, public street, or public
sidewalk if such discharge creates or contributes to a public hazard or public
nuisance. No person shall construct, build, replace, or maintain any dry
weather water outlet which discharges onto a public right-of-way, public
street, public sidewalk, roadside ditch, or other public property maintained by
the village without first obtaining a permit from the Village Maintenance
Superintendent.
   (B)   Sump pumps installed to receive or discharge groundwaters or
stormwater runoff shall be connected to the storm sewer system where possible
or discharged into a designated stormwater runoff drainage facility. No sump
pumps shall discharge directly onto a street surface or public sidewalk. Sump
pumps are prohibited from discharging in any way that would cause water to flow
onto any public streets, sidewalks or driveways within the public right-of-way.
   (C)   Footing drains and drainage tile shall discharge into a storm sewer or
other storm drainage facility. No footing drains or drainage tile shall be
connected to a sanitary sewer or be discharged directly onto a street surface
or public sidewalk.
   (D)   Downspouts and roof drains shall discharge onto the ground. In certain
cases such as small commercial areas, downspouts and roof drains may be
connected to the storm drains, if authorized by the Village Engineer. No
downspouts or roof drains shall be connected to a sanitary sewer or be
discharged directly onto a street surface or public sidewalk.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 5.19)
PUBLIC AREAS
§ 153.230 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Where a proposed park, playground, school site, or other public use
area shown in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the village and adjacent
unincorporated areas is located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision,
the Plan Commission or the Board of Trustees may require the designation or
reservation of such area in whole or in part within the subdivision.
   (B)   When an area of land designated for school sites or other public
facilities is located in whole, or in part, in a subdivision, the owner of the
subdivision shall designate on the preliminary plat and final plat that such
land is reserved for such use. The owner shall offer to sell such land to the
school district, the village, or other governing body, for an amount equal to
the fair market value of such land plus the cost of constructing the required
public improvements to service such land. If such land is not acquired or
arrangements made for acquisition within one year after the date of recordation
of the final plat, such land may thereafter be used by the owner for a use
permitted at its location.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 6.1)
§ 153.231 PARKS, SCHOOL SITES, AND OTHER PUBLIC AREAS.
   (A)   All subdivisions shall be designed so that park and recreational areas
are dedicated to the village in a manner and to the extent prescribed, so as to
accommodate the open space and recreational needs of those persons living on or
who may live within the confines of the subdivisions. The land or any fees
received under this chapter by the village shall be used only for the purposes
of providing park, open space, or recreational facilities.
   (B)   The owner of a subdivision may be required to dedicate land within a
subdivision for part and recreational purposes or may be required to pay a fee
in lieu of said dedication, in accordance with the following criteria:
      (1)   For subdivisions where the total area does not exceed three acres,
no land dedication or fee payment is required;
      (2)   For subdivisions where the total area is at least three acres but
less than ten acres, the owner has the option of dedicating at least 5% of the
subdivision area for parks, open spaces, or recreational uses, or paying a fee,
to be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Trustees; and
      (3)   For subdivisions where the total area is ten acres for more, the
owner is required to dedicate at least 5% of the total area for parks, open
spaces, or recreational uses.
   (C)   The Comprehensive Land Use Plan shall be used as a guide in locating
sites for parks and recreational uses. Generally, a central location which will
serve equally the entire subdivision is most desirable. However, lands
dedicated for sites should, where possible, be combined with such other park
dedications from abutting subdivisions in order to produce usable recreation
areas without hardship on the owners. Lands dedicated for sites shall be
located adjoining existing or planned streets or parks for access and the
maximum utilization of land for park purposes.
   (D)   The size, location, topography, and access to all planned parks, open
spaces, and recreational areas shall be part of the preliminary plan approval
process and is subject to review and approval by the Board of Trustees.
   (E)   Where a dedication is required, it shall be accomplished in accordance
with the ILCS prior to the time the final plat is approved by the Board.
   (F)   If the owner wishes to pay a fee instead of land dedication, the fees
shall be paid to the village prior to approval of the final plat. Such fees
shall be held in trust by the village solely for the development of parks, open
spaces, and recreation areas, which may be made available to serve immediate or
future needs of the residents of that subdivision or for the improvement of
other existing village parks which already serves such areas.
   (G)   When private open space for park and recreational purposes is proposed
within a subdivision and such space is to be owned and maintained by the
residents thereof, such private open space may be credited against the
requirements for dedication of park and recreation land, provided that the
Board finds it in the public interest to do so, and that the following
standards are met.
      (1)   The conditions of ownership and maintenance shall be approved by
the Plan Commission and the Board of Trustees.
      (2)   The use of such private open space is restricted for park and
recreational uses by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor or the
future owners of lots within the subdivision and which cannot be defeated or
eliminated without consent of the Board.
      (3)   Such private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park
and recreational purposes, taking into consideration the size, shape,
topography, access, and location of such open space.
      (4)   Such private open spaces are compatible with the Comprehensive Land
Use Plan.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 6.2)
§ 153.232 TREES.
   (A)   Trees shall be planted in each subdivision. Each subdivider shall
follow the standards required by §§
92.16 through
92.24 for the planting of trees along all road and street rights-of-way within
their subdivision (including both sides of a road or street). The subdivision
owner shall be responsible for furnishing, installing, and paying all costs
associated with compliance with the aforementioned ordinance.
   (B)   All trees shall be planted in accordance with §
92.17. The type of tree which can be planted shall be in accordance with §
92.18. Requirements for planting and maintenance required by §§
92.16 through
92.24 shall be followed by the subdivision owner.
   (C)   All trees must be planted prior to final approval of the subdivision’s
streets and the release of bonds.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 6.3)
§ 153.233 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   (A)   Existing features that would add value to residential development or
to the local government as a whole, such as trees, watercourses, historic
sites, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of
the subdivision.
   (B)   No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of grade
of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been granted.
   (C)   All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and
all trees where required shall be welled and protected against change of grade.
The plat shall show the number and location of existing trees and shall further
indicate all those trees marked for retention and the location of all proposed
trees required along the street side of each lot.
(Ord. 97-7, passed 7-1-1997, § 6.4)
§ 153.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any owner or agent who violates any section of this chapter shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less
than $50 nor more than $500 for each lot or parcel so transferred or sold or
agreed to be sold; each day the violation continues shall be deemed a separate
offense.
   (B)   Violations include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Recording of any plat or portion thereof that is not in compliance
with this chapter;
      (2)   The sale, offering for sale, or other transfer of ownership, of any
or all lots, without prior recording as set forth in this chapter;
      (3)   Failure to construct any public or private improvement included in
any approved plat or engineering drawings; and
      (4)   Construction of improvements not specifically approved in any
approved plat or engineering drawings, including changes in grading, fill,
alteration of drainage systems, and the like.
   (C)   The Plat Officer may determine and administratively assess a fine for
any instance of noncompliance with this chapter which he or she may find,
noting that said fine shall continue for each day that such violation
continues. The per diem fine for compliance shall be $50 per day. If the
offender pays the administrative fine assessed and also corrects said
noncompliance, then no further proceedings shall be required. In the event that
an administrative fine has been assessed, the extent of such fine may be
appealed to the Board of Trustees. The decision of the Board of Trustees shall
be final.
   (D)   The Plat Officer may also, in the event she or he finds any improper
construction activities not in conformance with this chapter, issue a stop-work
order which shall require the immediate cessation of any further work on the
project until the violations are remedied.

and other uses.
   (E)   To divide the entire municipality and all contiguous areas within one
and one-half miles of village limits of said municipality into district of such
number, shape, area and of such different classes (according to use of land and

of open spaces or other classification) as may be deemed best suited to carry
out the purpose of this chapter.

USE REGULATIONS
§ 154.020 PURPOSE.
   This chapter will establish zoning districts, describe the purpose of each
district, indicate allowable uses, set forth performance standards and provide
guidelines for mapping each district. The intent for establishing these
districts is to:
   (A)   Avoid conflicts between uses of different intensities and character.
   (B)   Meet location requirements for residential, commercial, and industrial
uses per the Land Use Plan.
   (C)   Recognize the unique development characteristics of some urban
neighborhoods.
   (D)   Regulate the intensity of uses based on access to the transportation
system, urban services, and infrastructure capacity.
   (E)   Provide a framework for development standards that ensure adequate
light and air and provide safe, uncongested neighborhoods.
   (F)   Provide a high degree of certainty on how the land will develop.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.021 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.
    For the purposes of carrying out the regulations in this chapter, the
village is hereby divided into the following districts:
   (A)   Agricultural District.
      (1)   AG-1 Agriculture. Intent. The intent of this zoning district is to
prevent scattered, indiscriminate urban development within areas which are
predominately vacant and which presently do not demonstrate any significant
potential for development. Large area of vacant land can be preserved for
future residential and industrial development according to economic and
physical need.
   (B)   Residential Districts.
      (1)   RS Residential Suburban. The intent of this zoning district is to
provide for detached, single-family dwellings on large lots (a minimum of
approximately 14 acres, or 20,000 square feet, in size) with related uses for
recreational, religious, or cultural activities. Some accessory uses are also
allowed. This is a rural, very low density, residential district, generally
located between an AG-1 and R-1 or R-2 District.
      (2)   R-1 Residential District (Single-Family). The intent of this zoning
district is to provide for detached, single-family dwelling with related uses
for recreational, religious, or cultural activities. Some accessory uses are
also allowed. This district should be protected from encroachment of uses that
create significant negative impacts upon the residential area. This a low
density, residential district.
      (3)   R-2 Residential District (Single-Family). The intent of this zoning
district is to provide for detached, single-family dwellings with related uses
for recreational, religious, or cultural activities. Some accessory uses are
also allowed. This district should be protected from encroachment of uses that
create significant negative impacts upon the residential area. This is a
medium-density, residential district.
      (4)   R-3 Residential District (Two-Family). The intent of this zoning
district is to provide for detached, single-family dwellings, two-family,
attached dwelling (duplexes), and accessory uses. These areas may include
related uses for recreational, religious, or cultural activities. Some
accessory uses are also allowed. This district should be protected from
encroachment of uses that create significant negative impacts upon the
residential area. Densities in this district range from four to eight dwelling
units per acre.
      (5)   R-4 Residential District (Multi-Family). The intent of this zoning
district is to provide for (low density/medium density/etc.) multifamily
dwellings. The multifamily buildings are generally low-rise, lower density
apartment of two to three stories. Open space and recreational amenities should
be provided for residents. The R-4 District is appropriate next to areas with
low density single family development patterns and may serve as a transitional
use. Density is controlled by floor area ratio and open space ratio. The
average density will range from 12 to 30 units per acre.
      (6)   R-5 Mobile Home (Manufactured Home) Park. The intent of this zoning
district is to provide for developments of mobile (manufactured) home parks,
including mobile (manufactured) homes, recreational vehicles, house trailers,
and mobile (manufactured) home park service buildings. This district allows
unified developments where individual pads are provided for owners of mobile
(manufactured) homes. All developments are subject to provisional use review
and all units must comply with current HUD construction codes and the Illinois
Manufactured Home Community. These developments are generally more in character
with single-family detached neighborhoods with private open space for each
dwelling unit.
   (C)   Commercial Districts.
      (1)   CB Central Business District. The primary intent of the Central
Business District is to provide for high density retail, service, and office
development mixed with residential units, parking, and institutional uses that
are located in the urban core. This district has high intensity uses in terms
of scale of buildings, traffic that is generated, size of businesses, and hours
of operation. The floor area ratio in this district is the highest density
allowed by this chapter. Public parking is provided in this district,reducing
the necessity of providing on-site parking for individual businesses. The area
draws heavy pedestrian traffic from nearby residents and employees in the area.
      (2)   CN Commercial Neighborhood District. The intent of the Commercial
Neighborhood District is to provide for the development of convenience shopping
and personal service needs of surrounding residential neighborhoods,
specifically apart from the Central Business District. This is a low density
commercial district. Overall sizes can range up to ten acres with proper
design. These areas should have good access to arterial and collector streets
and provisions for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
   (D)   Industrial District.
      (I)   I-1 Industrial District. It is the intent/ purpose of the
Industrial District to provide for the development of light industrial uses
such as service or wholesale establishments, manufacturing establishments,
distribution, research and development, and storage. Limited retail sales and
services related to the industrial uses may also be permitted as accessory
uses. Performance standards minimize the potential for significant byproducts
or hazardous uses. It is preferable to have a transitionarea between the I-
1 District and residential areas. I-1 Districts can be served by local street
system designated for trucks, although, the street system should exit to an
arterial or truck route. Traffic from the industrial area through residential
areas is discouraged.
   (E)   Public Land Overlay District.
      (1)   PL Public Lands. The intent of the Public Lands Overlay District is
to serve as an overlay district for public uses such as schools, parks,
colleges, and other government facilities. The district recognizes the more
intense use of land while underlying zoning regulates signage and space
requirements. The intensity of uses in this district can range from low
intensity parkland to high intensity, high traffic generators such as athletic
fields. Low intensity uses in this district, such as parks, are appropriate
next to residential uses. High intensity uses require a buffer or transition
area.

(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
PROVISIONAL AND SPECIAL USES
§ 154.050 GENERAL.
   (A)   Purpose. This subchapter will establish procedures for provisional and
special use review. The provisional and special use process allows flexibility
in this chapter by allowing uses in certain districts that would not otherwise
be permitted. Such uses may generally be compatible in a district, but
depending on how the use is designed and operated, there is a potential that
the use could be incompatible with the rest of the neighborhood.
   (B)   Provisional use. A provisional use is generally compatible with the
other uses permitted in a zoning district, but requires individual review of
their location, design, operation, configuration, and intensity to mitigate any
potential adverse effect on surrounding lands. Such uses need to show
information on a site plan to demonstrate compliance. The Planning and Zoning
Board needs to conduct a more thorough review to ascertain that the additional
provisions are being met. A valid provisional use permit, authorized by the
Planning and Zoning Board and the Village Board of Trustees in accordance with
the procedures stipulated herein, is required before applying for a building
permit or a certificate of occupancy.
   (C)   Special use. A special use is potentially appropriate in and
compatible with other uses in its zoning district, but, due to the scale and
nature of the use, the special use has a potential to make a major negative
impact on its district and the village as a whole. Such uses necessitate close
examination, site plan review, individual regulation and notification of
surrounding land owners. The proposed special use must serve a special need or
be required at that specific location for the public convenience. A valid
special use permit, authorized by the Planning and Zoning Board and the Village
Board of Trustees in accordance with the procedures stipulated herein, is
required before applying for a building permit or a certificate of occupancy.
   (D)   Continuance. Permits for provisional uses and special uses do not
necessarily run with the property. When a provisional or special property use
undergoes a change in ownership, management, or operation that is inconsistent
with the initial permit application, and any conditions of approval of that
application, said change will require, upon determination by the Zoning
Administrator, a review of the provisional or special use by the Zoning
Administrator or a new and complete re-application before the Planning and
Zoning Board as required by this chapter. All reviews shall determine whether
or not the change results in conditions inconsistent with the original
requirements mandated at the issuance of the permit. All decisions by the
Zoning Administrator may be appealed as provided under this chapter.
   (E)   Existing provisional and special uses.
      (1)   Where a use exists on the effective date of this chapter and it is
classified as a provisional use or special use by said chapter, it shall be
considered a lawful use. Additions or alterations to existing buildings or land
improvements for expansions of lawful uses may be made within the area of the
lot included in the ownership existing on February 18, 2020, but they shall be
subject to yard, floor area ratio, and building height requirements set forth
in this chapter for permitted uses in the districts in which they are located.
      (2)   A change in ownership will require conformance to the requirements
of §
154.038.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.051 PROCEDURES FOR PROVISIONAL USES.
   (A)   Submittal requirements for provisional use and special use approval.
No use indicated as a provisional use shall receive zoning approval without
first submitting to the Zoning Administrator the following items for site plan
review.
      (1)   Application for site plan approval on village forms. The
application must demonstrate that the proposed use is conducive to the public
convenience at that location, that the proposed use is designed, located, and
proposed to be operated so that it will not be unreasonably injurious or
detrimental to the district in which it shall be located, or otherwise
injurious or detrimental to the public welfare, and that the proposed use
conforms to the applicable regulations and standards of the district in which
it shall be located, including any regulations required in §
154.052.
      (2)   A site plan meeting the requirements of this section.
      (3)   An application fee, as determined from time to time by the Village
Board of Trustees.
   (B)   Site plan requirements. Each application for site plan approval for a
provisional use shall be accompanied by a site and landscape plan which shall
not exceed 24 by 36 inches in size and shall be drawn to a scale no greater
than 100 feet to the inch. Said site plan shall, if appropriate, include the
following information:
      (1)   The location, dimension, material, and configuration of all
buildings, structures and other improvements.
      (2)   The location and extent of all usable open space, and the proposed
use of open space.
      (3)   The location, access and other dimensions of proposed off street
parking facilities and the number and configuration of spaces to be provided.
      (4)   The location, dimensions and materials of sidewalks, driveways and
other impervious surfaces.
      (5)   A landscaping plan, in accordance with §§
154.210 through 154.214.
      (6)   The location of all property lines, utilities and related
easements, including electric lines, storm drainage, sanitary sewers, and water
services.
      (7)   An architectural drawing detailing all buildings and structures to
depict height.
      (8)   The lot size in square feet and the dimensions thereof, and the
location and extent of required setbacks and yards.
      (9)   The number and type of dwelling units proposed.
      (10)   The land uses surrounding the lot(s) for which the site plan
approval is being sought.
      (11)   The date, north arrow, scale, and name of the development, with
the permanent parcel number and a legal description for the property.
   (C)   Site plan review. The Zoning Administrator shall receive the site plan
and arrange a meeting of the Planning and Zoning Board to determine if the
proposed building, structure, or land improvement complies with the provisional
use standards established in this subchapter. The Planning and Zoning Board
shall determine whether the documentation presented justifies the granting of a
provisional use permit and whether the proposed use will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this chapter. The Planning and Zoning Board shall
forward its determination and recommendation to the Village Board of Trustees
which shall then approve, approve with amendment, or deny the granting of the
provisional use permit.
   (D)   Site plan recommendation or denial.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall recommend or deny the requested
provisional use permit, and may also impose such additional conditions and
requirements as are appropriate or necessary for the public health, welfare,
and safety, and to carry out the purpose of this chapter, including but not
limited to the following:
         (a)   Regulate the location, extent, and intensity of such use;
         (b)   Require the screening of such uses by means of fences, walls or
vegetation;
         (c)   Stipulate required minimum lot size;
         (d)   Stipulate vehicular access and volume;
         (e)   Require conformance to health, safety, and sanitation
requirements as necessary;
         (f)   Increase the required yards;
         (g)   Any other conditions deemed necessary to effect the purposes of
this chapter.
      (2)   Upon the determination that all the criteria have been met, the
Planning and Zoning Board shall approve the site plan. Zoning approval shall be
granted in accordance with §§
154.245 through
154.253. A provisional use permit is subject to all the developmental standards
applicable to permitted uses in the district in which it is located, unless
otherwise stated in the permit. Additionally, provisional uses are also subject
to the standards specified in each use district section, if applicable. The
Planning and Zoning Board may attach conditions to the approval in accordance
with this subchapter.
      (3)   If the proposed use does not conform to any one or more of the
general standards or the specific requirements of this chapter, the Planning
and Zoning Board shall so find and disapprove the site plan. The notification
shall be in writing and shall address the relevant and applicable standards
that caused the site plan to be denied.
      (4)   If a site plan is disapproved, the applicant shall be given the
opportunity to resubmit the site plan with modifications to specifically
address the concerns of the Planning and Zoning Board. Such modifications shall
constitute a new application.
      (5)   The notification of the findings of the Planning and Zoning Board
shall be within 30 days after the date a complete application for site plan
approval is received. Said recommendation shall be forwarded to the Village
Board of Trustees in accord with §
154.277(C).
   (E)   Appeals to the site plan for provisional use review. The decision of
the Planning and Zoning Board to disapprove or attach conditions to any site
plan, may be appealed to the Village Board of Trustees.
   (F)   Amendments to the site plan or conditions for provisional use. The
procedure for amendment of a site plan already approved or for a request for a
change of conditions attached to the approval of a provisional use, shall be
the same as for a new application for provisional use approval.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.052 PROCEDURES FOR SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Uses permitted through special use permit. Some uses of land, for one
or more of the following reasons cannot normally appear as uses permitted as a
matter of right, or provisional use in a particular district, but may be
permitted through approval of a special use permit:
      (1)   The use may involve a great deal of land.
      (2)   The use may be of a public or semi-public character, and as such be
important in the development of the village as a whole.
      (3)   The use may be reasonably approved as to a particular location on
account of factors or reasons not applicable to the zoning district as a whole.
   (B)   Application for special use. No use indicated as a special use or any
use not indicated as a permitted or provisional use shall receive zoning
approval without applying for and receiving special use approval from the
Planning and Zoning Board and the Village Board of Trustees. The application
for a special use permit shall be made to the Zoning Administrator and shall
demonstrate:
      (1)   That the proposed use is conducive to the public convenience at
that location;
      (2)   That the proposed use is designed, located, and proposed to be
operated so that it will not be unreasonably injurious or detrimental to the
district in which it shall be located, or otherwise injurious or detrimental to
the public welfare;
      (3)   That the proposed use conforms to the applicable regulations and
standards of, and preserves the essential character of, the district in which
it shall be located.
      (4)   Each application for a special use permit shall include each of the
following items:
         (a)   Application for a special use permit on forms provided by the
village, evidence of ownership and fee.
         (b)   Site plan meeting the requirements for a site plan for a
provisional use (§
154.052(B)).
         (c)   Architectural elevations and drawings showing all buildings and
improvements, including signs.
         (d)   A development schedule for the proposed development.
         (e)   Any other information requested by the Planning and Zoning Board
to determine if the conditions for the special use will be met.
   (C)   Procedure for special use review.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a complete application, the Zoning Administrator
shall schedule the item to be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Board at a
public hearing.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall conduct the hearing and make a
recommendation to the Village Board of Trustees on the application for a
special use permit. The recommendation shall include findings and recommended
conditions as provided for in this subchapter.
      (3)   The Village Board of Trustees shall make the final determination to
grant or deny the special use permit application.
   (D)   Findings for granting the special use. Before making any
recommendation to the Village Board of Trustees to approve or deny the
application for a special use permit, the Planning and Zoning Board shall make
a determination, based solely upon the evidence presented at a public hearing
conducted by the Planning and Zoning Board, on whether the application
satisfies all of the following criteria:
      (1)   That the proposed use meets some public or neighborhood need at the
specific location.
      (2)   (a)   That the proposed use is designed, located, and proposed to
be operated so that it will not be unreasonably injurious or unreasonably
detrimental to the district in which it may be located or otherwise injurious
to the public welfare.
         (b)   This may include concerns such as drainage on neighboring
properties, containing effects of operation on the subject site, increase in
the danger for fire or crime, visual impact, or impairment of adequate light
and air to adjacent properties.
      (3)   That the proposed use conforms to all applicable regulations and
standards of the district in which it shall be located that are reasonably
possible.
      (4)   (a)   That the proposed use preserves the essential character of

      (5)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to minimize
potential increase in traffic congestion or possible situations that would
create poor traffic circulation including access issues.
   (E)   Conditions for special uses. The Planning and Zoning Board shall make
recommendations to the Village Board of Trustees to approve, approve with
additional conditions, or to deny the proposed special use permit. The
additional conditions may be recommended as appropriate or necessary for the
public health, safety, and welfare, and to satisfy the findings required for
granting a special use. Such conditions may include but are not limited to the
following:
      (1)   Regulate the location, extent, business hours, and intensity of
such uses.
      (2)   Require adherence to an approved site plan.

PUBLIC LANDS OVERLAY DISTRICT PL
§ 154.160 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this zoning district is to serve as an overlay district for
public uses such as schools, parks, colleges, and other government facilities.
The district recognizes the more intense use of land while underlying zoning
regulates signage and space requirements. The intensity of uses in this
district can range from low intensity parkland to high intensity, high traffic
generators such as athletic fields. Low intensity uses in this district, such
as parks, are appropriate next to residential uses. High intensity uses require
a buffer or transition area.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 154.170 GENERAL.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   These regulations for planned unit developments for residential
uses offer an alternative method for developing land. This alternative allows
flexibility in applying certain zoning standards. Such flexibility requires a
review process and development plan to safeguard health, safety, and welfare
concerns.In exchange for flexibility, Planned unit developments are required
through traditional zoning techniques. These requirements are designed to
offset the impact of changes in development standards allowed through these
provisions such as increased densities, mixed land uses and reduced setbacks.
The planned unit development designation acts as an overlay zone. With this
approach, the overall intensity of a development is consistent with the
underlying zoning district and Land Use Plan.
      (2)   The planned unit development regulations should have the following
outcomes:
         (a)   Allow flexibility that is not available through standards and
restrictions contained elsewhere in this chapter.
         (b)   Promote more efficient use of land.
         (c)   Incorporate site features such as topography, views, vegetation,
water features, and other factors into the design so they become assets to the
development.
         (d)   Provide additional amenities that would not otherwise be
required under conventional zoning.
         (e)   Promote building styles and architectural styles that complement
one another.
         (f)   Allow a mix of uses that are designed to negate potential
conflicts that normally occur between incompatible land uses.
         (g)   Promote the most efficient arrangement of circulation systems,
land use, and buildings.
         (h)   Promote environmentally sensitive developments.
         (i)   Allow development, under a specifically approved design concept
and site plan, which otherwise may not be permitted by this chapter.
   (B)   Zoning. Planned unit developments for residential uses are permitted
in District R-4 by right, and may be permitted as a provisional use in the AG-
l, RS, and R-3 Districts. Refer to §
154.025, Table 154.025: Use Table.

district.
 
MAXIMUM FLOOR AREA RATIO FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
DISTRICT MAXIMUM FAR
AG-l     0.30
RS       0.42
R-3      1.08
R-4      1.68
 
   (C)   Zero lot line — cluster developments. The fee simple transfer of
ownership of a lot in an approved planned development with a zero lot line or a
single-family detached cluster development is permitted provided the
development meets the recording and permit requirements in this subchapter and
the requirements of the subdivision regulations. Such developments shall comply
to the following regulations:
      (1)   The minimum area of a lot shall not be less than 3,200 square feet
for a zero lot line dwelling and 4,000 square feet for a cluster development.
The minimum width shall not be less than 40 feet.
      (2)   There shall be no minimum side yard on one side (zero side yard
setback) and a minimum ten-foot side yard on the opposite side for zero lot
line dwellings. The minimum front yard shall be no less than 20 feet and the
minimum rear yard shall be no less than ten feet for both a zero lot line and
cluster subdivisions.
      (3)   A four-foot building wall maintenance/drainage easement shall be
provided on a lot adjacent to the zero lot line property line, dedicated the
entire length of the lot. With the exception of walls or fences, such perpetual
maintenance easement shall be clear of structures and above ground utility
appurtenances. This easement shall be shown on the final development plat and
shall be incorporated into each deed transferring title to the property either
as a covenant in the owner's certificate or in each deed transferring property
in the planned development.
      (4)   Roof overhangs may penetrate the easement of the adjacent lot a
maximum of 24 inches, but the roof shall be so designed that water runoff from
the dwelling placed on the lot line is limited to the easement area or
transported to an approved outlet.
   (D)   Common open space requirements for major planned developments.
      (1)   For major planned developments, in addition to required usable open
space necessary to meet the open space ratio as established by the underlying
zoning district for residential planned developments, a minimum of 10% of the
gross site area shall be common open space in accordance with the design
guidelines in
Table 154-3: Planned Development Design Guidelines for Planned Developments.
      (2)   Major planned developments must contain a parcel designated as
common open space which shall be not less than 6,000 square feet in area or
less than 30 feet in its smallest dimension.
      (3)   Public parks and water surfaces such as ponds or lakes may count
towards the required common open space if such water surfaces or park areas are
adjacent and accessible to land that is designated as common open space in the
development. In no case shall a public park or water surface comprise or be
counted towards more than 50% of the required open space.
      (4)   All common open space shall be either:
         (a)   Conveyed to a not-for-profit corporation or entity established
for the purpose of maintaining said common open space for the benefit and use
of the owners and residents of the planned development, or adjoining property
owners, or anyone or more of them by providing perpetual maintenance of all
recreational open space in the project. All lands so conveyed shall be subject
to the right of the owners within the planned development to enforce
maintenance and improvement of the recreational open space; or
         (b)   Guaranteed by a restrictive covenant describing the open space
and its maintenance and improvement running with the land for the benefit of
residents of the planned development, or adjoining property owners.
   (E)   Design guidelines for planned developments.
Table 154-3: Planned Development Design Guidelines for Planned Developments
contains design guidelines for planned developments. Since planned developments
can be built at higher density and may contain uses not allowed on adjacent
properties, design quality above the minimum otherwise allowedin zoning
districts is necessary. It is intended that the planned development design
guidelines provide a general outline of criteria needed to be addressed as part
of the review of individual developments. It is recognized that not all of the
design guidelines may apply to each planned development, but the intent of each
section must be met as described in the purpose section of each guideline.
Within
Table 154-3: Planned Development Design Guidelines for Planned Developments,
use of the word "shall" indicates a design guideline which must be met for all
planned developments. Use of the word "should" indicates a design guideline
which must be met unless the applicant demonstrates that the particular
criteria is not applicable or impractical as applied to the particular planned
development. Use of the word "may" indicates a design guideline which is
desirable, but not required and may be requested in exchange for flexibility
granted through the planned development.

§ 154.176 TABLE 154-3: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGN GUIDELINES.
TABLE 154-3: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGN GUIDELINES
1.0   SITE PLAN GUIDELINES
TABLE 154-3: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGN GUIDELINES
1.0   SITE PLAN GUIDELINES
    Purpose: Well-designed site plans create a sense of internal cohesiveness
    and compatibility with the surrounding property. The site plan shall be
   designed to take into account all internal and external physical features
    to create an arrangement of and relationship between all structures on the
    site, which minimizes impacts from or on surrounding land uses and which
    promotes a sense of cohesiveness for the development.
    Dumpsters, central air units, utility boxes, and other similar features
1.1 should be located in inconspicuous locations and screening should be
    provided so that they are not visible from public right-of-way or adjacent
    property.
    Individual buildings should be integrated into the overall site plan
1.2 through joint parking, pedestrian connections, plantings, shared access,
    and location of freestanding buildings so as not to block visibility of the
    larger commercial center.
    Adverse off-site impacts should be minimized through building orientation
1.3 and provisions for appropriate transition areas such as a landscaped
    buffer, park, berm, or combination of treatments.
    Buildings should be sited and grouped in a coherent layout based on a site
1.4 analysis that considers topography, views, privacy, drainage, function of
    buildings, and other design guidelines contained herein.
2.    TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION
    Purpose: The layout of the circulation system is basic to the design of a
   Planned Development. The traffic and circulation system shall provide for
    efficient, safe, aesthetic movement of pedestrians and vehicles, through
    and adjacent to the development.
2.1 There shall be adequate access for emergency vehicles, garbage collection,
    and delivery vehicles.
    The development shall be designed with the minimum number of access points
2.2 to public streets necessary to serve the traffic generated by the proposed
    use.
    Safe and convenient multi-use sidewalks or paths should be provided from
2.3 residences to recreation areas, bus stops, parking areas, and community
    buildings within the Planned Development.
    Design of the internal street system should be coordinated with the
2.4 existing and future street system and conform to the Transportation Element
    of the Comprehensive Plan. Continuation of collector streets shall be
    provided for through the site in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan.
2.5 Parking facilities for bicycles should be provided at convenient locations.
3.   ARCHITECTURAL QUALITY
    Purpose: Planned Developments shall include architectural design which
   results in a cohesive design compatible with existing buildings on or
    around the site.
    Multiple buildings in a Planned Development should relate to one another
3.1 through common architectural styles, scale, building materials, and
    signage.
3.2 Architectural design should create visual interest through textures,
    complementary colors, and attractive facades.
3.3 Buildings and signage should be sensitive to the style, period, and scale
    of neighboring properties.
 
TABLE 154-3: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGN GUIDELINES
TABLE 154-3: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGN GUIDELINES
3.   ARCHITECTURAL QUALITY
3.4 Street furniture such as light posts, trash receptacles, and benches shall
    be functional and compatible with the architectural design.
    Where large structures are required, mass should be broken up through
3.5 setbacks, building offsets, varied story heights, and other design
    techniques.
3.6 Use of art features such as fountains, special landscaping, sculpture, and
    murals that lend identity to a development should be utilized.
3.7 Walls and fences should be compatible with site architecture and should be
    unobtrusive to neighbors.
3.8 All buildings shall utilize finished building materials on all sides.
4.    ENVIRONMENTAL GUIDELINES
    Purpose: Planned Developments shall be constructed with regard for the
   environment to avoid adverse impacts on existing natural features,
    drainage, erosion, water quality, and energy conservation.
    Drainage features should be integrated into the development and treated as
4.1 an asset by providing aesthetically pleasant open space and multi-use
    facilities.
4.2 Floodplains, drainage features, and natural areas should be preserved and
    enhanced as natural environments.
    Adequate setbacks and access to stormwater facilities and drainage ways
4.3 should be provided in order to encourage dual use as recreation, habitat,
    and storage area for excessive rainfalls and to provide for future
    maintenance.
    Preservation and addition of vegetation should be provided along stream and
4.4 drainage ways to prevent erosion, provide natural habitats, and improve
    water quality.
    Significant trees of good health should be protected from damage during
4.5 construction and from future land uses in the development whenever
    possible.
4.6 Building layout should consider sun angles, prevailing winds, shade, and
    other factors to save energy costs.
5.0   OPEN SPACE GUIDELINES
   Purpose: Planned Developments shall provide for both the preservation of
    natural areas and the creation of areas for active or passive recreation.
    Where space permits, a development should incorporate a variety of open
5.1 space including areas for active recreation, passive recreation, and
    undeveloped natural areas.
5.2 Undeveloped open space should preserve healthy vegetation and remove dead
    or diseased trees.
5.3 Play areas for children should be close to building entrances and should be
    located so children do not have to cross high traffic area.
    Active recreation facilities provided on site should reflect the age of the
5.4 residents, consider existing nearby public facilities, and provide adequate
    area and dimensions for the use consistent with national standards.
    Passive recreation areas should be graded and seeded or have other ground
5.5 cover. Such areas should include trails, picnic areas, and take advantage
    of vegetation, shade and views, and be removed from nuisance areas.
 
TABLE 154-3: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGN GUIDELINES
TABLE 154-3: PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DESIGN GUIDELINES
5.0   OPEN SPACE GUIDELINES
5.6 Open space areas should be spread out to serve the entire development and
    should be connected through trails or common yards.
    Water detention areas may comprise a portion of the open area, but should
5.7 not represent the majority of open space and should be usable by the
    residents.
6.0   PRIVACY/SECURITY GUIDELINES
    Purpose: As an incentive, Planned Developments may be built at a higher
   density than conventional developments. Allowing higher density while
    maintaining privacy for residents is a goal. Planned Developments shall
    consider security as a design feature.
6.1 Residential units should be oriented and spaced to promote privacy.
6.2 Entrances to buildings and parking areas shall be well lighted.
6.3 Public spaces should be designed to be visible from dwelling units and
    promote a sense of ownership for surveillance and security purposes.
6.4 Remote entrances to public spaces not directly visible from neighboring
    units and the establishment of secluded areas should be avoided.
6.5 Dwelling units should be oriented or screened to avoid glare from
    headlights.
7.0   LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING GUIDELINES
    Purpose: Landscaping of the Planned Developments shall be designed to
    provide for adequate landscaping and effective screening for off-street
   parking areas and for areas where non-residential use or high density
    residential use may be detrimental to lower density areas. Landscape
    materials shall be integrated into the overall scheme of the site and
    should complement the other physical features of the area.
7.1 Landscaped buffers required along the perimeters between incompatible uses
    shall be integrated into the overall landscaping for the development.
7.2 Selection of plant materials shall be in conformance with the Village's
    Tree Ordinance.
    The selection and location of landscape materials in utility corridors
7.3 shall be such that at their mature height, trees shall not interfere with
    overhead utilities and streetlights.
7.4 Clusters of trees and bushes or flowerbeds should also be used throughout
    the site to provide visual relief.
7.5 Street trees along public streets and private access drives should be
    provided at a ratio of at least one tree per sixty feet of frontage.
7.6 Other treatments such as planters, flower beds, and decorative rock or
    stone should be considered to provide relief in larger impervious areas.
    Landscaping should be provided at site entrances, public areas, and
7.7 adjacent to buildings to provide visual interests and screen mechanical
    equipment.
7.8 Plant material shall be maintained in such a manner as to preserve their
    functional aesthetic integrity.
7.9 Whenever possible, existing mature trees on the site should be incorporated
    into the overall landscape design and preserved as part of the development.

      (7)   Any parking or loading space established prior to the effective
date of this chapter which is used or intended to be used in connection with
any building, structure or use, or any space designed and intended to comply
with the requirements of this chapter for any such building or structure
erected after such effective date shall hereafter be maintained in conformance
with the provisions of this chapter for as long as said building or structure
remains, unless the owner provides in another location an equivalent number of
spaces in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The Planning and
Zoning Board shall at all times be furnished proof of permanency of the parking
area provided in compliance with this chapter.
   (C)   Site plan requirements for parking lots. A site plan is required prior
to the construction or redesign of any accessory parking lot or any parking lot
in excess of three parking stalls. Said site plan may be part of a larger site

drive is for exit only.
      (1)   Drive-in facilities shall provide a lane for stacking of
automobiles waiting to drive through the facility. The minimum total capacity
of the stacking area shall be four automobiles per drive-up window. Each

SIGNS
§ 154.200 GENERAL.
   (A)   The sign regulations set forth in this subchapter are made in
accordance with an overall plan and program for the public safety, preservation
of property values, and the general welfare of the village. The enaction of
these sign regulations will establish reasonable standards for commercial and
other advertising through the use of signs in order to maintain and encourage
business activity, and to avoid uncontrolled proliferation of signs. These are
also intended to aid in traffic control and traffic safety; preserve and
protect property values; lessen congestion of land and air space; provide
against undue concentrations of signs which distract and endanger traffic
safety and traffic flow; recognize the rights of the public in roads, streets,
and highways; and to preserve the character of the village through a community
plan that provides for a pleasant, healthful, spacious, clean, and well-
balanced community.
   (B)   These sign regulations distinguish between on-premise and off-premise
business signs. The restriction of off-premise business signs will
significantly aid in the realization of the goals and purposes recited above.
   (C)   These sign regulations specifically distinguish between outdoor
advertising sign structures and signs based on the specific finding that such
structures are and have been and continue to be utilized for announcements of
both a commercial and noncommercial nature, have been a traditional and lawful
use of land in the village, and are a unique communication medium involving
nationally standardized signs, which are generally made available to the
public. At the same time, the regulations recognize that a limitation upon the
size, number, and spacing of such structures is consistent with and will
further the goals expressed in this subchapter.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.201 LIMITATIONS ON SIGNS.
   (A)   Compliance and required permits.
      (1)   Any sign or outdoor advertising sign structure that is not
specifically allowed or regulated in this subchapter is prohibited.
      (2)   No sign or outdoor advertising sign structure may be erected,
constructed, established, maintained, enlarged, relocated, or changed by a
person except in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.
      (3)   Permit required. No sign or outdoor advertising sign structure may
be installed, erected, constructed, or placed without a permit from the Zoning
Administrator, except as specifically provided for by this subchapter. The
permit fee shall be as established from time to time by the Village Board of
Trustees. No permit may be issued for a sign or outdoor advertising sign
structure which is not permitted under this chapter or which is not in
compliance with applicable construction codes.
      (4)   (a)   Permit applications for outdoor advertising sign structures
(OASSs) shall include a site plan prepared by a licensed surveyor and drawn to
scale. Said site plan shall, at a minimum, show the location of the footprint
of the proposed OASS and the location of the footprint of any buildings and
permanent commercial freestanding signs as defined by this chapter within 400
feet of the proposed footprint of any OASS measured along the same side of the
street and around corners. The following signs need not be included in any
survey: instructional or directional signs, real estate signs, temporary signs,
political signs, noncommercial signs, or any official traffic control or
direction sign.
         (b)   Applications shall also include color photographs (or color
printouts of digital photographs) of the proposed OASS site from 100 feet to
200 feet from the proposed OASS from each direction along the street to which
the OASS will be directed, with the approximate location of the proposed OASS
marked on each photograph.
   (B)   Prohibited hazardous signs.
      (1)   No person shall erect, construct, establish, maintain, enlarge, or
relocate any of the following signs which:
         (a)   Is structurally unsafe; or
         (b)   Constitutes a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate
maintenance, dilapidation, or abandonment; or
         (c)   Is not kept in good repair; or
         (d)   Is capable of causing electrical shocks to persons likely to
come in contact with it; or
         (e)   Is supported by hanging or swinging from eye bolts, cables, or
similar means.
      (2)   Any sign or outdoor advertising sign structure which, by reason of
its size, location, content, coloring, or intensity of illumination,
constitutes a traffic hazard or a detriment to traffic safety by obstructing or
detracting from the visibility of any governmentally erected traffic sign or

LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING
§ 154.210 GENERAL.
   (A)   Purpose. This subchapter will provide a buffer between land uses of
differing intensity, improve the quality of life by creating a more attractive
environment in which to live and work, and promote overall quality of
development. This purpose can be achieved by breaking up large expanses of
paved areas, screening utilitarian and open storage areas, and providing
appropriate buffer yards.
   (B)   Compliance.
      (1)   Any new use of land development of a structure shall provide and
maintain landscaping and screening in accordance with the requirements of this
subchapter.
      (2)   A change in the character of a use shall require that landscaping
and screening in accordance with this subchapter shall be provided and
maintained. A change in the character of a use shall include:
         (a)   Any expansion of the use onto additional property that is not
part of the lot which the use is situated prior to the expansion.
         (b)   Any expansion of the structure which the use is situated in by
more than 25%.
      (3)   Each applicant for a special use, planned development, provisional
use, or building permit which requires landscaping, shall include as part of
the application a landscaping plan demonstrating compliance with this
subchapter.
      (4)   When a parking lot is enlarged, the added area shall comply with
the requirements of this subchapter for parking lots. When a parking lot is
enlarged by more than 50% in area, both the existing and new portions of the
parking lot shall conform with these requirements. The requirement to bring the
parking lot into compliance shall not reduce the number of parking spaces below
the minimum number of spaces for that use or combination of uses.
   (C)   Landscaping plan required. The landscaping plan may be shown on the
required site plan for parking lots, special uses, provisional uses, or
building permit applications, or may be submitted as a separate document. A
landscaping plan shall be required for planned developments in accordance with
§§
154.170 through
154.176.
   (D)   Contents of a landscaping plan. A landscaping plan shall include a
date, north arrow, and common address of the development. The plan shall be
drawn to scale and shall include dimensions, property lines, structure
setbacks, parking areas and driveways. At a minimum, the following information
shall be included on the landscaping plan:
      (1)   Existing plantings and vegetation that will remain and that satisfy
the planting requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   The location of trees, shrubs, and ground cover to be planted with
appropriate labels as to type of landscaping that correspond with the plant
lists.

   (E)   Amendments to the landscaping plan. If there is no significant change
in the quantity, size, or location of plant material and if new plants are of
the same general category and have the same general design characteristics as
the materials to be replaced, no modification of the landscaping plan is
required. Replacement material must be from the approved plant list in the
village's tree ordinance.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.211 SCREENING BETWEEN DIFFERENT LAND USES.
   (A)   Types of screens for side and rear yards. For purposes of
administering the requirements of this subchapter, the following definition
shall apply:
      (1)   TYPE A SCREENING. There shall be a minimum six-foot buffer yard and
a decorative fence or wall which is a minimum of six feet in height as measured
from the elevation at the lot line. The fence or wall shall be a decorative
fence or wall that meets the design standards of §
154.214(B).
      (2)   TYPE B SCREENING. This screen shall consist of a buffer yard of at
least ten feet in width. Within the buffer yard there shall be plantings of one
tree and three shrubs for every 40 linear feet along the length of the property
line between the adjacent uses. Shrubs shall be at least of medium height for
buffer areas. Small shrubs used in combination with a berm to achieve an
overall height of four feet may be substituted for the required plantings.
      (3)   TYPE C SCREENING. The screen shall consist of a buffer yard of at
least 15 feet in width. Along the property line between land uses there shall
be a decorative fence or wall which is a minimum of six feet in height as
measured from the elevation at the lot line. The fence or wall shall be a
decorative fence or wall that meets the design standards of section §
154.214(B).
      (4)   TYPE D SCREENING. The screen shall consists of a buffer yard at
least 15 feet in width.  Within the buffer yard, there shall be a continuous
planting of evergreen trees or any type of shrubs from the approved list in the
village's tree ordinance, of at least medium height. The screen should be
expected to reach a height of six feet or greater in three years. The plant
material should be three feet in height when planted and there shall be no gap
greater than four feet apart when planted. A combination of a berm and small
shrubs or evergreen trees may be used to achieve the required minimum six feet
for the height of the screen.
      (5)   TYPE E SCREENING. The screen shall consist of a buffer yard at
least 25 feet in width. Within the buffer yard there shall be plantings of
bushes and trees equal to one tree and three shrubs per 30 linear feet.
Plantings may be clustered or in a continuous arrangement. Trees and shrubs
used in the Type E buffer shall be from the plant list, which is available for
inspection in the office of the Village Clerk, of trees for buffer areas and
shrubs shall be at least of medium height approved for buffer areas. Small
shrubs used in combination with a berm to achieve an overall height of at least
six feet when the plantings mature, may be substituted for the required
plantings.
      (6)   TYPE F SCREENING. This screening shall consist of a buffer yard at
least 25 feet in width. Within the buffer yard, there shall be planting screen
equal to Type D screening. There shall be a fence or wall which is a minimum of
six feet in height as measured from the elevation at the lot line. The fence
or wall shall be a decorative or non-decorative material. The fence shall be
75% or more opaque and the planting shall be located on the lower impact side
of the buffer yard.
      (7)   Commentary.
         (a)   Type A and B screens are intended for buffering between land
uses where there is generally a low level of land use conflict. The main
purpose is to provide privacy and to create a visual barrier. Type A screens
with a fence may be more appropriate for developments with space constraints.
The Type B screen relies on landscaping to achieve this effect. Additional yard
area is required.
         (b)   Type C, D, and E screens are intended to buffer between
residential uses and medium impact uses, such as more intense traffic, noise,
litter, and size of development. These screens are necessary not only as a
visual barrier but to minimize the negative impacts from the more intense uses.
The types of fence and landscaping are taller and wider. Type F screen is for
high impact uses. They may also be used for areas with potentially hazardous
materials or dangerous equipment. A fence is also required. As long as the
planting screen is visible to soften the appearance, the fence does not need to
be a decorative type fence.
   (B)   Screening requirements along side and rear lot lines. Whenever land
uses or various intensities are adjacent to one another, screening shall be
provided in accordance with the following table:
 
              No           Low          Medium Impact High
              Impact       Impact                     Impact
No Impact     No Screening A or B       C, D or E     F
Low Impact    A or B       No Screening C, D or E     F
Medium Impact C, D or E    C, D or E    No Screening  C, D or E
High Impact   F            F            C, D or E     No Screening
 
   (C)   Classification of low, medium and high impact uses. For purposes of
determining the appropriate screen, uses shall be classified in accordance with
the uses listed below.
      (1)   No impact. Single-family residential; two-family residential;
parks; agriculture.
      (2)   Low impact. Mobile (manufactured) homes; multi-family home; office
buildings less than 6,000 square feet; religious institutions; schools and
colleges; government buildings; libraries; personal services less 6,000 square
feet; retail uses less than 6,000 square feet; automobile sales display areas,
outdoors; accessory parking lots.
      (3)   Medium impact. Retail; office building and institutional uses and
facilities between 6,000 square feet and 100,000 square feet; commercial uses
not low impact; restaurants and taverns; hospitals; hotels/motels; commercial
recreation; auto service uses; drive-in uses; warehouse/manufacturing totally

building supplies, contractor equipment or recycling centers; storage of
inoperable autos/major auto repair; power plants, treatment facilities and
other similar utilities; concrete batch plants.
         (b)   Note: A fence is not required for high impact retail.
   (D)   Buffer yard requirements for front yards. Whenever any higher impact
use abuts a lower impact use, the following requirements shall apply:
      (1)   Low and medium impact uses. If a parking lot is located in between
the street and building for which screening is required, then requirements for
parking lot screening shall satisfy requirements for front yard buffers. If
there is no parking lot between the street and building for which screening is
required, then the required front yard setback shall be equal to the front yard
setback of the adjacent residential district with screening in accordance with
requirements for parking lot screening along the street side.
      (2)   High impact uses. The front yard setback for high impact uses shall
be equal to the front yard setback of the adjacent residential district. No
parking lot shall be located within this front yard setback. The setback shall
be landscaped in accordance with requirements for parking lot perimeters except
that any area visible from the public right-of-way that is used for loading,
mechanical equipment, outdoor storage (not outdoor sales), or trash disposal
shall be screened equivalent to a Type F screen.
   (E)   Buffer yards design requirements.
      (1)   At least 90% of the buffer yard required by this subchapter shall
be kept free of obstructions including, but not limited to, outside storage,
accessory structures, active recreational uses, and service areas. There shall
be no parking permitted in required buffer yards. No parking or access drives
are permitted in the buffer yards. Any encroachment in the buffer yard shall be
screened in accordance with requirements for utilitarian areas.
      (2)   Buffer yards shall be required to have a groundcover with a minimum
of 75% living grass or other groundcover from the village's tree ordinance. The
remaining area may be nonliving, consisting of bark, wood chips, decorative
rock or stone, or other similar material.
      (3)   If all or any part of the buffer requirements regarding fence,
walls or landscaping is provided on the adjacent property at the time the
building permit is approved, the proposed uses must provide only that amount of
the buffer which is not provided on the adjacent property regardless of whether
the buffer on the adjacent yard is maintained.
   (F)   Requirements for buffer yards next to vacant property.
      (1)   When the adjacent property is vacant and zoned or designated in the
Land Use Plan for a lower impact use, a minimum of only 50% of the required
buffer yard shall be required. In no case, however, shall such buffer yard be
less than the minimum yard requirements in the underlying zoning district.
      (2)   The term VACANT as used herein means that there is no structure, or
vehicular surface area within 200 feet, or any outstanding approved village
permit or final plat for the construction of the same, from any common property
line of the developing property and the adjoining property. Public parks or
common open space shall not be considered as VACANT land.
      (3)   When a lower impact development is constructed adjacent to an
existing higher impact use or to vacant land or designated on the Land Use Plan
as a nonresidential use, the required rear or side setback adjoining the
nonresidential use shall be no less than 50% of the required buffer yard.
   (G)   Buffer yards and screening requirements for existing uses. When an
existing use increases the amount of square feet in the building by 25% or
more, the following requirements shall apply:
      (1)   If the expansion occurs on an adjacent lot, requirements for buffer
yards and new lots shall apply as it would for a new use.
      (2)   If the expansion or change in use occurs on the same lot as the
existing building, the buffer yards may be reduced to the setback of the
existing building. The type of screen, would be required in accordance with the
table in §
154.211(B).

§ 154.225 LIGHTING.
   (A)   Intent. The intent of regulation for exterior lighting and glare is
to:
      (1)   Provide minimal lighting of public and private property for the
safety, security, and convenience of occupants and the general public and;
      (2)   To eliminate or reduce the nuisance and hazards of excessive light
and glare.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 154.230 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This subchapter will define and regulate different types of
nonconformities with the intent that ultimately such nonconformities will be
brought into compliance with the requirements of this chapter. This subchapter
declares that nonconformities are incompatible with surrounding conforming
properties. Consequently, such nonconformities should be removed or mitigated.
Their continued existence should be discouraged and they should not be enlarged
upon, expanded, or extended.
   (B)   Unabated nonconformities undermine the effectiveness of zoning
regulations. Some nonconformities, such as industrial activities in residential
areas, are a severe detriment to the neighborhoods. Noncomplying properties are
also unfair to the majority of property owners who do comply with the
regulations.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.231 APPLICATION OF NONCONFORMING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Lawful existing nonconformities.
      (1)   Any nonconformity lawfully existing on the effective date of this
chapter or prior zoning ordinances, but does not conform with the regulations
of this chapter, may be continued under the regulations of this subchapter.
      (2)   If a building or land hereafter becomes subject to the provisions
of this subchapter, whether by annexation to the village or otherwise, and any
aspect of the use or land is nonconforming, such use or aspect of the use shall
be considered a lawful nonconformity and may continue under the provisions of
this subchapter.
      (3)   If a nonconformity is created by subsequent amendment to this
chapter, such nonconformity shall be considered a lawful nonconformity which
may continue subject to the provisions of this subchapter.
      (4)   Any use, structure, or feature which was illegally established
shall not be permitted to continue under the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Rules of interpretation.
      (1)   The regulations of this subchapter pertaining to a building
occupied by a nonconforming use shall apply not only to buildings completely
occupied by such a use, but shall also apply to buildings in which the
nonconforming use occupies only a portion of the building.
      (2)   Nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting change
in tenancy, ownership, or management of a nonconforming lot, use, or structure,
provided such change is otherwise lawful.
      (3)   A variation granted by the Planning and Zoning Board shall not be
considered a nonconformity and shall not be subject to the provisions of this
subchapter.
   (C)   Exceptions.
      (1)   If the village takes by eminent domain or by purchase a portion of
a lot for a public right-of-way, and thereby renders said lot or a structure on
said lot nonconforming, the following rules shall apply:
         (a)   A nonconforming lot may be developed or redeveloped for any use
permitted in the
district in question as long as all development regulations in said district,
other than those regulating lot area and width, are complied with.
         (b)   A nonconforming structure may be continued, structurally
altered, repaired, or reconstructed provided that such modifications shal1 not
increase the nonconformity.
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of any building or lot for which there
was an approved building permit at the time of the effective date of this
chapter. Such building shall be considered a lawful nonconformity and shall be
subject to the provisions of this subchapter. A permit which has been abandoned
under the provisions of §§
154.245 through
154.253 shall not qualify for this exemption.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.232 RULES FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Nonconforming structures and lots.
      (1)   Nonconforming lots shall comply with the provisions for substandard
lots in §
154.024(A).
      (2)   Alterations to a nonconforming structure shall not increase,
extend, or expand the nonconformity.
      (3)   If the part of the structure which is not in conformance is
demolished, removed, or declared uninhabitable, it shall not be replaced or
restored unless it is in conformance with the regulations in this chapter.
   (B)   Nonconforming features.
      (1)   Nonconforming parking and loading areas shall comply with the
provisions in §§
154.185 through

provisions in §§
154.210 through
154.214.
      (4)   Any other nonconforming feature shall be allowed to continue to
exist, but cannot be altered, enlarged, or expanded in a manner that would
increase its nonconformity.
      (5)   Any other nonconforming feature that is removed, demolished, or
destroyed shall be replaced or restored only if it is conformance with the
regulations in this chapter, unless the nonconforming feature is a historically
significant element of a structure designated as a landmark or is located
within a conservation or historic district.
      (6)   The sale of merchandise or food outdoors is only allowed upon
receipt of a permit issued by the village, unless permitted otherwise by the
provisions of this chapter. When the sales are not permitted by the provisions
of this chapter, they shall be discontinued immediately.
      (7)   Nonconforming accessory uses shall be terminated when the principal
use is terminated.
   (C)   Nonconforming provisional and special uses.
      (1)   Any provisional use that is nonconforming with respect to location,
which is abandoned, demolished, destroyed, or declared uninhabitable, shall not
be replaced or restored unless it is to a use that is permitted at that
location.
      (2)   No provisional use that is nonconforming with respect to location
shall be:
         (a)   Expanded to another part of the building; or
         (b)   Enlarged, extended, or expanded unless the use is changed to a
use which is permitted at that location; or
         (c)   Structurally altered or undergo major repairs.
      (3)   Any use that would be required to be approved as a provisional or
special use, that was legally established prior to February 18, 2020, which is
abandoned, demolished, destroyed, or declared uninhabitable shall not be
replaced or restored unless it is approved in accordance with §§
154.050 through
154.052.
      (4)   Any provisional or special use shall not expand into another part
of the building, enlarge the building, make structural alterations, or make
major repairs unless approved in accordance with §§
154.050 through
154.052.
   (D)   Nonconforming use of land.
      (1)   (a)   Any lawful use of land which becomes nonconforming as a
result of the adoption of this chapter, annexation, or subsequent amendments,
may be continued only for a period of five years from the date upon which such
use becomes nonconforming.
         (b)   Since the use of land does not represent major improvements, it
is reasonable to expect a land owner to bring the property into compliance.
Some examples where this may apply are for salvage yards, used car lots, and
parking lots.
      (2)   The term "use of land" includes both principal and accessory uses
and refers not only to the use of bare or unimproved land, but also to any use
of land which involves a structure or involves an accessory structure, but no
principal structure. Temporary structures or manufactured homes that are not
part of a unified development shall be considered accessory buildings.
      (3)   Any nonconforming use of land that is abandoned or discontinued for
a continuous period of six months or more shall not be resumed unless it
complies with the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Any nonconforming use of land shall not expand on the zoning lot or
move to another portion of the zoning lot unless it complies with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Nonconforming use of a building or other structure.
      (1)   If a nonconforming use of a building or other structure is
abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of one year or more, or the
building or other structure containing said use is demolished, destroyed, or
declared uninhabitable, then the subsequent use of such building or other
structure shall be in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   If a structure with a nonconforming use is damaged by fire,
explosion, or other catastrophe, but is not destroyed, then repairs to the
structure will be allowed within 12 months from the date the damage was
incurred, and shall be carried on without interruption.
      (3)   Any nonconforming use of a structure shall not expand into any
other portion of the structure unless it complies with the provisions of this
chapter.
      (4)   No major repair or structural alteration may be made to any portion
of a structure which contains a nonconforming use if the effect of said major
repair or alteration is to extend the life of that portion of the structure.
      (5)   Any structure with a nonconforming use may not change to another
use unless the new use complies with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.233 PROVISIONS FOR EXISTING RESIDENCES IN R-1, R-2, AND R-3 DISTRICTS.
   (A)   (1)   If a nonconforming structure in the R-l, R-2, or R-3 Districts
is damaged as a result of fire, explosion, or other catastrophe; and the owner
wishes to reconstruct or repair the structure for the same use; but the owner
believes that the damaged structure does not meet the definition of a destroyed
structure based upon the value of the structure as established by the equalized
assessed valuation; then the Zoning Administrator may require that the owner
submit evidence of the value of the structure immediately prior to the
occurrence causing said damage and of the estimated cost of said repair or
reconstruction below 50% of the value of the structure prior to the occurrence.
Evidence of the value of the structure- immediately prior to the said
occurrence may include, but not be limited to a recent appraisal on such
property.
      (2)   The adoption of these regulations created nonconforming residential
uses in the R-l through R-3 Districts. Pursuant to applicable village
regulations as set forth in this chapter, a nonconforming use damaged by fire,
explosion, or other catastrophe must be rebuilt as a conforming use if such
damage amounts to more than 75% of the value of the structure immediately prior
to the occurrence. In this case, the structure is considered DESTROYED. In
order to lessen the effects of the new regulations, these nonconforming use
provisions set forth criteria, by which a nonconforming use that is destroyed
may be rebuilt and continued as a nonconforming use.
   (B)   Within 20 days following submission of documents to support the
owner's claim that the structure was not "destroyed" as defined in this
subchapter, the Zoning Administrator shall render a decision regarding whether
said structure was in fact "destroyed".
   (C)   If the Zoning Administrator determines that the structure was
destroyed, then the structure shall not be repaired or reconstructed for the
same or another nonconforming use except in compliance with an approved site
plan which meets the requirements for provisional uses as enumerated in §§
154.050 through
154.052.
   (D)   The reconstruction of the nonconforming use must commence within the
first 12 months following the day on which the nonconforming use was destroyed.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.234 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Evidence of nonconformity.
      (1)   The burden of establishing a legal nonconformity is to be met by
the owner or party seeking to apply the provisions of this chapter. The
following items may constitute sufficient proof to establish if the
nonconformity was lawfully established:
         (a)   Date of construction of the structure or date the use was
established (Proof may consist of a certified copy of the business license or
structure permit).
         (b)   Continuous operation of the nonconformity (proof may consist of
affidavits signed by persons who have personal knowledge of the continuous use
of the premises since said use was in conformity with the then-existing zoning
regulations).
         (c)   Any advertisement, correspondence, or other documentation with a
date identifying that the operation was legally in existence prior to February
18, 2020, annexation, or subsequent amendments.
         (d)   The date of collection or reporting of taxes, fees, or other
payments that may establish the date of existence of the nonconformity.
         (e)   Any other proof of documentation that can legally establish the
date of existence of the nonconformity.
      (2)   As part of the zoning approval process, §§
154.245 through
154.253 requires the Zoning Administrator to determine if any part of the
building permit application is nonconforming. If there is a nonconformity, then
the owner must supply adequate proof that the nonconformity is lawful as
defined in this subchapter. Upon submitting such evidence, the permit will be
reviewed to determine if it complies with the requirements of this subchapter.
      (3)   If the owner cannot prove that the nonconformity is lawful, then it
will be necessary to
bring the property into compliance prior to issuing any permit. If the owner
fails to comply, zoning enforcement action may be necessary.
      (4)   Some reasons why the property may no longer be conforming is a
change of zoning, amendments to the zoning district which no longer allow the
use, or annexation of property that does not conform to village zoning
districts.
   (B)   Illegal uses or terminated nonconforming uses. Properties subject to
zoning enforcement for an illegal use or termination of a nonconforming use
prior to February 18, 2020 are not eligible to continue as a nonconforming use
and must be ceased.
   (C)   Notification of nonconforming uses.
      (1)   If a non-residential property undergoes a change in ownership, or a
change in use, or if a new owner desires to expand, remodel, or renovate any
structure on the property or do any other work that requires a building or
occupancy permit, as required by this chapter, the owner shall meet with the
Zoning Administrator to discuss the nonconforming status and, if required, the
preparation of a mitigation plan. Upon notification of a nonconforming use or
upon determination that a change in ownership or change in use or application
for permit as provided herein, the Zoning Administrator shall prepare a notice
of the nonconforming use, containing the following items:
         (a)   A description of the real estate sufficient for identification.
         (b)   The current zoning designation.
         (c)   A description of why the property is nonconforming.
         (d)   An explanation of regulations regarding nonconforming uses of
structures.
      (2)   If an owner does not wish to comply with all the requirements
stated in this chapter, the owner shall have a period of three months from the
date of change in ownership or change in use or application for permit as
provided herein, whichever is earlier, to submit a mitigation plan. If no plan
is timely submitted and the property does not meet the requirements of this
chapter, the use of the property shall be terminated.
   (D)   Mitigation plan submission. The following material shall accompany an
application for a mitigation plan:
      (1)   Application for mitigation plan.
      (2)   Site plan meeting the requirements of this subchapter.
      (3)   A description of proposed measures to mitigate the impact of the
nonconforming use and time schedule for instituting such measures.
      (4)   Fee as established by the Village Board of Trustees from time to
time.
   (E)   Mitigation plan site plan requirements. Each application for a
mitigation plan approval shall be accompanied by a site and landscape plan
(collectively, the "site plan"). The dimensions of said site plan shall not
exceed 24 inches by 36 inches and shall be drawn to a scale which is not
numerically greater than 100 feet equals one inch. The following data and
information shall be included in said site plan:
      (1)   The location, dimension, material, and configuration of all
buildings, structures, and other improvements.
      (2)   A statement of the current use of the property. The owner may
substitute another nonconforming use, insofar as the use proposed to be allowed
through the mitigation plan is equal to, or is more restricted than, the
classification of the former use and such substitution or addition does not
increase congestion in the streets, impair the health, safety, morals or
general welfare of the district in which it is located.
      (3)   The location and extent of usable open space.
      (4)   The location, access, and other dimensions of existing and proposed
off-street parking facilities and the number and configuration of spaces to be
provided.
      (5)   The location, dimensions, and materials of existing and proposed
sidewalks, driveways, and other impervious surfaces.
      (6)   The location and intensity of illumination of any illuminated
areas.
      (7)   The proposed use of open space.
      (8)   A landscaping plan in accordance with the requirements of §§
154.210 through
154.214.
      (9)   The location of all property lines, utilities, and related
easements, including electric lines, storm drainage, sanitary sewers, and water
services.
      (10)   The elevation of all buildings and structures to depict height.
      (11)   The lot size in square feet and the dimensions thereof.
      (12)   The land uses surrounding the lot(s) for which site plan approval
is being sought.
      (13)   A date, north arrow, scale, legal description and address of the
property, and name of the development.
   (F)   Procedure for mitigation plan review.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a complete application with the accompanying
material, the Zoning Administrator shall schedule the item to be reviewed by
the Planning and Zoning Board.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator shall prepare a report, presenting the
facts of the case to the Planning and Zoning Board. The report shall make a
recommendation to forward the case to the Village Board of Trustees; to
approve; to approve with additional requirements; or to defeat the proposed
mitigation plan. In the event the Zoning Board of Trustees defeats the proposed
mitigation plan, the case shall not be forwarded to the Village Board of
Trustees.
      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall conduct a hearing in accordance
with the procedures in §§
154.260 through
154.264.
   (G)   Mitigation plan findings. Before approving any mitigation plan, the
Planning and Zoning Board shall make a favorable finding of fact, solely based
upon evidence presented at the public hearing. The findings shall always
include the following:
      (1)   That the proposed continued operation will not increase congestion
in the streets, or impair the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the
surrounding properties.
      (2)   That there is a plan to bring as many features of the use into
compliance with this chapter as is practical, or with the intent of the
chapter.
      (3)   That the owners are taking adequate measures to offset negative
impacts from the operation.
      (4)   That the continuation of the nonconforming use, in consideration of
the degree of land use conflict between a nonconforming use and its surrounding
properties, will diminish the value of nearby property, nor impair the public
health, safety, morals or general welfare of the surrounding properties.
   (H)   Mitigation plan approval. The Planning and Zoning Board will approve
or defeat the proposed mitigation plan. Approval of the mitigation plan may
also include additional conditions and requirements as are appropriate or
necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, and to
satisfy thefindings required for approving a mitigation plan. Such conditions
may include, but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Regulate the location, extent, and intensity of certain aspects of
the use as appropriate.
      (2)   Require additional landscaping or screening of such uses by means
of fences, walls, and vegetation.
      (3)   Regulate vehicular access and the design and location of parking
and loading areas and structures.
      (4)   Require conformance to health, safety, and sanitation requirements
as necessary.
      (5)   Regulate signs and outdoor lighting to be more compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood.
      (6)   Any other conditions deemed necessary to effect the purposes of
this chapter.
   (I)   Mitigation plan certificate. As part of the approval of the request
for a mitigation plan, the Planning and Zoning Board shall complete a
certificate of approval which shall contain the following information:
      (1)   A legal description and common address of the subject property.
      (2)   A statement for each finding summarizing how such finding has been
satisfied.
      (3)   Any conditions, safeguards, or flexible standards imposed on the
mitigation plan as a condition of approval.
      (4)   A list of mitigation measures not indicated on the site plan.
      (5)   A time table for undertaking mitigation measures.
      (6)   Any exhibits, including the site plan, shall be attached to the
mitigation plan permit with a statement that the mitigation plan approval is
conditioned on the project being operated in accordance with such plans unless
specific exceptions are stated in the certificate of approval.
   (J)   Failure to approve mitigation plan. If the Planning and Zoning Board
fails to approve the mitigation plan, the landowner may elect one of the
following options:
      (1)   Resubmit a new application and plan.
      (2)   Appeal to the Village Board of Trustees. If the Village Board of
Trustees disapproves the mitigation plan, then the application shall be
referred back to the Planning and Zoning Board to determine a termination date
for the nonconforming use.
      (3)   In any one case, only three proposed mitigation plans may be
submitted. If none of these plans are approved by the Planning and Zoning Board
or, upon appeal, to the Village Board of Trustees, then a date for termination
of the nonconforming use must be established.
      (4)   Such termination date shall be based on the severity of the
impacts, the expected economic life of the structure, the market value of the
investment, and any other relevant factors. In no case shall the termination
date be longer than ten years.
   (K)   Failure to reapply for or to comply with the mitigation plan. Failure
to comply with the mitigation plan shall constitute a zoning violation and
shall be subject to zoning enforcement action.

      (3)   The Village Building Official shall not issue a certificate of
occupancy unless the building or structure, as built, enlarged, extended,
structura1ly altered, reconstructed or moved, complies with all drawings and
specifications included in the application for the building permit. Any

         (d)   In accordance with §
153.096(B), the village has accepted the dedication of all the required public
improvements for the subdivision.
      (5)   No land shall be occupied or used, and no building hereafter
erected or altered shall be occupied or used, in whole or in part, for any
purpose whatsoever until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the
Village Building Official stating that the building complies with all the
building and health laws and ordinances, and with the provisions of this
chapter and amendments thereto.
      (6)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the continuance of the
present occupancy or use of any existing building, except as may be necessary
for safety of life and property.
      (7)   If the application for a certificate of occupancy involves a change
of use, the Village Building Official shall not issue the certificate of
occupancy unless the proposed use or uses is conforming in the district in
which it is proposed to be located. If a provisional use or special use permit
was granted to authorize the proposed use, it shall be so noted on the
application, and on the certificate of occupancy, if issued.
      (8)   The certificate of occupancy issued by the Village Building
Official shall state upon its face the precise purpose or purposes for which
the building, structure or land shall be used.
      (9)   Any transfer of ownership of the building, structure or land which

air conditioning, refrigeration, gas piping, sprinkler and stormwater permits,
and any other similar permits (which may be required now or required in the
future) authorizing a change in a building or property shall contain a
statement indicating the existing and proposed use for which the building,
structure, or improvement to the land will be used. The Village Building
Official and the Zoning Administrator shall review each application which
indicates a change of use, even if the proposed permit does not indicate a
change in the exterior elements of the property. The permit shall be issued
subject to zoning approval. No such permit issued which purports to authorize a
use, structure, or improvement to the land not in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter shall be valid.
         (b)   This division (C) adds the requirement that if any other type of
permit will result in a change of use, that such permit will also require
zoning review. This is intended to prevent illegal conversions in single-family
areas, as well as catch new uses in commercial areas that may not meet parking

requirements of §§
154.050 through

154.230 through
154.234.

any and all other applicable standards as required by this chapter.
      (2)   Upon a determination that all of these requirements are met or not
met, the Zoning Administrator shall approve or disapprove the permit and note
this on the application. The Zoning Administrator shall indicate those uses
that are nonconforming. Such approval shall reference action by the Planning
and Zoning Board or the Village Board of Trustees which may have imposed
specific conditions as authorized by this chapter. No permit which requires
review under the provisions of this chapter shall be issued unless it has
received such approval.
   (E)   Limitations of zoning approval.
      (1)   Suspension of permits. Any zoning approval shall become invalid if

or zoning approvals that were obtained in an illegal manner.

PLANNING AND ZONING BOARD
§ 154.260 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish procedures for
appeals from administrative decisions and procedures for relief from the
provisions of this chapter through variations.
      (2)   No zoning ordinance can anticipate every situation or condition
that will be encountered when administering the regulations. This chapter
provides for a form of relief or adjustment. The method of relief has typically
been through the Planning and Zoning Board. The Planning and Zoning Board hears
appeals on administrative interpretations and acts on requests for variations
from this chapter.
   (B)   Planning and Zoning Board — established.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall consist of seven members
appointed by the Village President, and confirmed by the Village Board of
Trustees. One member shall be appointed for one year, one for two years, one
for three years, one for four years, one for five years, one for six years, and
one for seven years; the successor to each member to be appointed to serve for
a term of five years. One of the members so appointed shall be named as
Chairperson by the Village President, with the consent of the Village Board of
Trustees; said Chairperson shall also assume the duties of the Zoning
Administrator as described in this chapter.
      (2)   One of the members so appointed shall be named as Secretary by the
Village President, with the consent of the Village Board of Trustees. In the
event of the absence of the Chairperson, the Secretary shall act in their place
and stead as Acting Chairperson.
      (3)   The appointing authority has the power to remove a member of the
Planning and Zoning Board for cause, including but not limited to missing four
consecutive Planning and Zoning Board meetings, and after a public hearing.
Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of a member whose place has
become vacant. All meetings of the Planning and Zoning Board shall be held at
the call of the Chairperson, and at such other times as the Planning and Zoning
Board may determine. The Chairperson, or in their absence the Acting
Chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All
regular meetings of the Planning and Zoning Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon every question, or if absent
or failing to vote, indicating that fact, and shall also keep records of its
examinations and other official actions. Every decision upon which the Planning
and Zoning Board is required to act under this chapter shall be a public
record.
      (4)   Decisions — generally.
         (a)   The concurring vote of four members of the Planning and Zoning
Board shall be necessary to decide in favor of the applicant in any matter
which it is required to pass under this chapter.
         (b)   Decisions of the Planning and Zoning Board shall be made at a
public meeting by motions made and seconded, and by roll can vote. The motions
shall include findings as specified in this chapter.
         (c)   All reports, testimony, exhibits, plans or specifications which
were considered by the Planning and Zoning Board shall be made a part of the
record of the case.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)

Trustees.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.262 PETITIONS.
   (A)   Amending petitions.
      (1)   Applicants, or their authorized agents, may request an amendment of
an application for a variation or an appeal, by submitting a request in writing
prior to the beginning of the public hearing, or to the Planning and Zoning
Board at the public hearing. The request shall specify the proposed amendment
and reason for the request.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall make a finding as to whether
there is substantial difference between the case as it has been described in
the public notice and the case as amended. If substantial difference is found,
a new public notice shall be required and a new sign shall be posted before the
hearing of the case may proceed.
      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall also determine whether the
nature of the amendment is such as to require referral for reexamination by
Planning and Zoning Board members having made reports on the original
application. If such referral is found necessary, the Planning and Zoning Board
may proceed with the hearing or may continue it to a time and place specified.
   (B)   Repeat petitions. An applicant seeking to reapply after denial of a
request cannot reapply for an identical or substantially similar request as one
considered by the Planning and Zoning Board within the last 12 months (of final
Planning and Zoning Board action on the request). The Zoning Administrator
shall determine if any application is identical or substantially similar to any
request made of the Planning and Zoning Board in the last 12 months.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.263 APPEALS.
   (A)   Notice of appeal. An appeal from any order, requirements, decision, or
determination made by the Zoning Administrator, may be taken to the Planning

and to any other person directly interested in the outcome of the appeal.
Persons interested in the appeal shall mean owners of the subject properties

property owners immediately adjacent thereto.
   (C)   Findings for appeals. On an appeal from any order, decision or
determination made by the Zoning Administrator, the Planning and Zoning Board
shall be limited to determination of the propriety of the questioned action
taken by the Zoning Administrator. The Planning and Zoning Board may reverse,
affirm, or modify the action appealed. In order to reverse or modify an action,
anyone or combination of the following findings must be satisfied:
      (1)   That the provision in question is unclear and an interpretation is
necessary to determine the intent and application of the provision.
      (2)   That the Zoning Administrator misinterpreted the provisions of this
chapter.
      (3)   That the section of this chapter does not apply in this situation.
   (D)   Rulings on appeals.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall decide the appeal by the next
regular meeting after the close of the hearing.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall not, based on its decision on
an appeal, grant a variation in the application of the regulations of this
chapter.
      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Board may only reverse any order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the Zoning Administrator with a
concurring vote of four members of the Planning and Zoning Board.
      (4)   If the Planning and Zoning Board reverses or modifies any action of
the Zoning Administrator, such decision shall state the findings that support
the ruling.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.264 VARIATIONS.
   (A)   Variation — purpose.
      (1)   A variation is a grant of relief from the terms of this chapter.
The purpose of a variation is to ensure that no property shall be deprived
unreasonably of the development opportunities commonly enjoyed by other
property in the same locality and district. A variation from the requirements
of this chapter may only be granted to the Planning and Zoning Board finding
that the criteria, as specified herein, have been satisfied.
      (2)   It is important to note that a variation is not a matter of right.
There should be some hardship or unique conditions which prevent the property
from being used as other similarly situated properties.
   (B)   Applications for variations. An application for a variation may be
filed by the property owner, contract purchaser with the owner's consent, or
the owner's agent.
   (C)   Application requirements. Each application for a variation shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator. The application shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   Name and address of the applicant.
      (2)   Existing zoning classification.
      (3)   The provision of this chapter that the applicant is seeking to vary
and a description of the variation being sought.
      (4)   Legal description and common address for each property for which
zoning action is requested.
      (5)   A description of the facts supporting each of the required findings
of fact.
      (6)   (a)   A drawing sufficient to illustrate the nature of the
variation request.
         (b)   The drawing in this division (C)(6) may be a site plan, building
plan, elevation, landscape plan or other type of drawing depending on the
request.
      (7)   Other relevant characteristics about the subject property as
indicated on the application form.
      (8)   Evidence that design options which comply with the provisions of
this chapter are not feasible.
   (D)   Evidence of ownership. Applicants for a variation shall submit
evidence of their interest in the property along with complete disclosure of
the legal and equitable ownership in any real estate affected by the requested
variation. Evidence of ownership may include a policy of title insurance,
warranty deed, a legally binding contract to purchase, or other indication of
ownership. If title is in a land trust in addition to proof of ownership, the
trustee shall provide certification of the names, addresses, and percentage of
interest of each beneficial owner. When the petitioner is someone other than
the owner, a letter of authorization from the legal owner shall accompany the
application.
   (E)   Published notice.
      (1)   Notice of time and place of any hearing date shall be published at
least once, not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before such hearing, in
a newspaper in general circulation within the village. The notice shall give
the date, time, and place of the hearing and contain a brief description of the
requested variation.
      (2)   If the variation pertains to a specific parcel or parcels, then the
notice shall also contain a legal description and common address of the area
for which the change is proposed.
   (F)   Written notice.
      (1)   For any variation, the applicant shall submit with an application,
the most recent list of taxpayers of record for all property, any portion of
which, is located on or within the area defined by a line extended 250 feet
outward in all directions from the perimeter of the subject properties. The
list of taxpayers shall be compiled from records maintained by the Champaign
County Assessor's Office not more than 30 days before the date the application
is filled with the Zoning Administrator. The responsibility for obtaining and
providing this information shall be the applicant’s. The measurement of all
public right-of-way shall be excluded in measuring the 250-foot perimeter. If
any part of a condominium property is located within 250 feet of the subject
property, the name of each taxpayer of record of the condominium shall also be
submitted to the village.
      (2)   Not less than 15 days, but not more than 30 days before a public
hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall give written notice by first class mail
to the following:
         (a)   The applicant.
         (b)   The owners of the subject property for which the variation is
sought as identified in accordance with this chapter. If ownership is in a land
trust or partnership, only the trustee or general partner need be notified.
         (c)   The taxpayers for property within 250 feet of the subject
property as identified in accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The notice shall contain the place and time for the first public
hearing on the application, the address of the subject property, a brief
statement of the nature of the request, and the name of the applicant. The
village shall make a good faith effort to comply with the provisions in this
chapter. Failure to send the notice or notices not received by parties
identified herein will not invalidate any action by the village.
   (G)   Notice by sign.
      (1)   An applicant seeking a variance for any real estate, which requires
a public hearing, shall allow the village to post weatherproof signs,
indicating the upcoming hearing for the property, which are adequate in size
and number to be visible from the adjacent roadways. The village shall post the
signs approximately ten days prior to the public hearing. A good faith effort
shall be made to keep the signs in place until the close of the public hearing,
but in no case shall the signs remain after ten days from the completion of the
final public hearing.
      (2)   The required sign shall contain the words "NOTICE OF PUBLIC
HEARING" at the top of the sign. The sign shall indicate that a zoning
variation is being requested for this property, the date, time, and place where
the hearing shall be conducted, a statement that the public is invited, and the
phone number for the village.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator may waive the requirement to post the sign
in cases involving multiple lots where other measures are being used to notify
interested parties. Such waiver shall be made a record of the case.
      (4)   The village shall make a good faith effort to comply with the
requirements of this chapter, however, failure to comply with these
requirements shall not invalidate any zoning action.
   (H)   Minor variations — defined.
      (1)   The following shall be classified as a MINOR VARIATION:
         (a)   A reduction of up to 25% of the minimum required lot width or
lot area.
         (b)   A reduction of up to 50% of the minimum required side or rear
yard.
         (c)   A reduction of up to 25% of the minimum required front yard.
         (d)   A reduction of up to 25% of the total number of required off-
street parking spaces.
         (e)   An alternative landscape that would reduce the amount of
required plant material or reduce the area of landscaping by 25%.
         (f)   A reduction of up to 100% of the required side yard for fire
escapes or ramps or handicap accessibility when the building was constructed
prior to February 18, 2020.
         (g)   Allowing parking of a recreational vehicle or watercraft that
extends into a front yard.
      (2)   MINOR VARIATIONS are classified as those provisions where
relaxation of the requirements does not represent a significant departure from
the overall intent and purpose of this chapter. If the applicant can
demonstrate the need for such relief, the minor variation would have a
relatively low impact on the neighborhood. In many cases, such as a variation
for a fire escape, granting the relief from a specific provision may actually
result in overall improvement of life safety concerns.
   (I)   Minor variation — finding of fact.
      (1)   Before any variation is granted, the Planning and Zoning Board
shall make a favorable finding of fact, solely based upon evidence presented at
a public hearing conducted by the Planning and Zoning Board, that each of the
following criteria has been satisfied:
         (a)   That the variation is consistent with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter.
         (b)   That the variation is necessary for a reasonable use of the
property.
         (c)   That there is a practical difficulty in meeting the requirements
of this chapter, that the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved would bring a
particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulation were to be carried out.
         (d)   That the plight of the petitioner is not common, is due to
unique circumstances, and the proposed variation will not serve as a special
privilege, but will alleviate conditions not shared by other property in the
rest of the village.
         (e)   1.   That the petitioner did not knowingly or deliberately
create the property condition causing the practical difficulty from which the
petitioner seeks a grant of relief through the proposed variation.
            2.   Some examples of a self-created hardship are:
               A.    Paying too much for a piece of property and seeking a
variation to intensify the use to recapture the investment or there is a
personal preference for a particular design;
               B.    Constructing something in violation of this chapter’s
regulations and seeking a variation to bring it in conformance after the fact;
and
               C.    Selling off a portion of the property and seeking a
variation because the lot is now too small for the proposed use.
         (f)   That the proposed variation will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
         (g)   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply
of light and air to adjacent property; substantially increase congestion in the
streets; increase the danger of fire or crime, diminish the value of nearby
property; nor impair the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, or
general welfare.
         (h)   That the proposed variation represents the minimum deviation
from established standards necessary to accomplish the desired improvement.
         (i)   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return
if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located.
         (j)   That the conditions upon which the petition for variation is
based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same
zoning classifications.
      (2)   Since the minor variation is intended to have a relatively low
impact on the surrounding area, the findings of fact that need to be met are
not as stringent as they are for a major variation. Generally, the applicant
must demonstrate that there is some practical difficulty and no reasonable
alternative to comply with the regulation. The applicant must present evidence
to this effect per the application requirements established previously. Other
findings insure that neighborhood, health, safety, welfare, and other concerns
are being met.
   (J)   Minor variations — decisions.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall take action on the variation
request within 30 days after the close of the public hearing. The Planning and
Zoning Board may require such conditions and restrictions upon the premises to
be benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards
set forth in this subchapter to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such
variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to implement the general
purpose and intent of this chapter. Failure to maintain such conditions or
restrictions as may have been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation
of such variations.
      (2)   This section allows the Planning and Zoning Board to impose
conditions on variations to ensure that the proposal does not negatively impact
surrounding properties. Some common conditions that could be imposed are
requirements for landscaping around parking areas, construction specifications,
hours of operation, location of parking spaces or drives, and other similar
requirements.
      (3)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall have the authority to take the
following actions regarding the request for minor variations as defined herein:
         (a)   Grant all or a portion of the minor variation being requested.
         (b)   Prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to ensure that
the variation is carried out consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
         (c)   Deny the request for a variation.
      (4)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall grant the minor variation only
upon a favorable finding of fact that each of the criteria specified in each
section have been satisfied. A concurring vote of four members shall be
necessary to approve each finding and grant the variation request. Planning and
Zoning Board action on a minor variation is the final action.
   (K)   Grant of variation. As part of the approval of the request for a minor
variation, the Planning and Zoning Board shall complete a written "grant of
variation" certificate which shall contain the following information:
      (1)   A legal description and common address of the subject property.
      (2)   The provision of this chapter that the Planning and Zoning Board is
granting relief from and a description of the variation being granted.
      (3)   Findings of fact on each of the criteria required to be met
specifying how each finding has been satisfied.
      (4)   The terms of the relief as prescribed by the Planning and Zoning
Board, including any conditions or safeguards appropriate to the proposal.
      (5)   The date the grant of variation becomes effective.
      (6)   Any exhibits containing plans or specifications for the proposed
use or variation shall be attached to the grant of variation with a statement
that the variation is conditioned on the project being built in accordance with
such plans.
   (L)   Major variation — defined. A MAJOR VARIATION is any grant of relief
which has not been defined as a minor variation. No variation shall be granted
by the Planning and Zoning Board which permits a use which is not a permitted
use in the district, where the property in question is located, or which
permits a use which is expressly of implicitly prohibited by the terms of this
chapter.
   (M)   Major variation — finding of fact. Before any variation shall be
granted, the Planning and Zoning Board shall make a favorable finding of fact,
solely based upon evidence presented at a public hearing conducted by the
Planning and Zoning Board, that each of the following criteria has been
satisfied:
      (1)   That the variation is in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   That the property cannot yield a reasonable return if subject
to a strict and literal application of the regulations imposed by this chapter.
         (b)   NO REASONABLE RETURN means there is generally little, if any
alternatives to develop the property. Without the variation, it is likely  that
the property cannot be utilized. Merely, the likelihood that the property in
question may have a greater value if the variation is granted shall not satisfy
this criteria.
      (3)   (a)   There is an unusual hardship in meeting the requirements of
this chapter.
         (b)   An unusual hardship is created by conditions that are not common
to the remainder of the community. Often these conditions are unique to one
parcel and could not be anticipated by this chapter. Floodplains, irregular
lots by creeks or railroad right-of-ways, steep topography, and other existing
natural features are typical factors that create hardship.
      (4)   (a)   The plight of the petitioner is due to such unique
circumstances that the proposed variation will not serve as a special
privilege, but will alleviate some condition not shared by other property in
the same locality and district.
         (b)   This finding differs from that of the minor variation. The minor
variation allows that if the condition is not unusual for a particular area, it
may be appropriate to grant the variation. The standard for "unique
circumstances" requires that relatively few if any other property in the
village share these circumstances.
      (5)   That the petitioner did not knowingly or deliberately create the
unusual hardship from which the petitioner seeks a grant of relief through the
proposed variation.
      (6)   The proposed variation will not alter the essential character of
the locality.
      (7)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the streets,
increase the damage of fire or crime, diminish the value of nearby property,
nor impair the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, or general welfare.
      (8)   The variation represents the minimum deviation from established
standards necessary to accomplish the desired improvement.
   (N)   Major variations — decisions.
      (1)   Zoning Board authority. The Planning and Zoning Board shall take
action on the variation request within 30 days after the close of the public
hearing. The Planning and Zoning Board shall take one of the following actions
regarding the request for a major variation:
         (a)   1.   Recommend all or a portion of the major variation being
requested.
            2.   Prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to ensure that
the variation is carried out consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
            3.   Deny the request for a major variation, and so notify the
Village Board of Trustees of this action.
         (b)   Further actions must follow the procedures stated in §§ 154.275
through 154.278.
         (c)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall recommend a request for a
major variation only upon a favorable finding of fact that each of the criteria
specified for major variations have been satisfied. A concurring vote of four
members shall be necessary for the Planning and Zoning Board to make a
recommendation.
      (2)   Village Board of Trustees authority. Within 30 days of the Planning
and Zoning Board recommendation to approve a major variation, the Village Board
of Trustees shall act to approve or disapprove a resolution issuing a grant of
variation. Unless extended by mutual agreement, if Village Board of Trustees
does not act on the resolution to approve the grant of variation, the variation
is deemed approved.
   (O)   Termination of grant. In the event that a variation is granted for a
property, the owner has one calendar year to begin work or construction of the
property. If construction does not commence within that one year, then the
grant of variation is terminated. In the event the variation is terminated, the
owner must reapply for the variation.

binding contract to purchase, or other indication of ownership. If title is in
a land trust in addition to proof of ownership, the trustee shall provide
certification of the names, addresses, and percentage of interest of each
beneficial owner. Where the petitioner is someone other than the owner, a
letter of authorization from the legal owner shall accompany the application.
   (D)   Site plan requirements.
      (1)   For map amendments, the applicant shall submit one reproducible
site plan of existing conditions on the subject property. The site plan shall
include the scale, north arrow, property lines, public streets adjoining the
property, and if applicable, existing buildings, fences, access points,
parking, and circulation areas. The site plan shall show all dimensions of
lines, buildings, and setbacks, and include building height. For other zoning
action, site plan submission shall meet the requirements of the subchapter
regulating such action.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may waive the requirement for a site plan
if it is determined that information on the site plan is generally available
from other sources, or that the nature of the request is such that the
requirement for a site plan is not necessary to consider the zoning action. The
Zoning Administrator shall make the waiver in writing and such a waiver shall
be submitted along with the application.
   (E)   Fees and processing costs.
      (1)   A fee shall accompany each application; the fee as established by
the Village Board from time to time.
      (2)   The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining and pay all costs
thereto or hire a title company to prepare the list of the taxpayers of record
for all properties required to receive written notice as required in this
subchapter.
   (F)   Published notice. Notice of time and place of the hearing shall be
published at least once, no more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before the
hearing, in a newspaper in general circulation within the village. The notice
shall give the date, time, and place of the hearing and contain a brief
description of the proposed zoning action. If the zoning action pertains to a
specific parcel or parcels, then the notice shall also contain a legal
description and common address of the area for which the change is proposed.
   (G)   Written notice.
      (1)   (a)   For any zoning action for real estate, which requires a
public hearing in accordance with this chapter, the applicant shall submit,
with the application, the most recent list of taxpayers of record for all
property, any portion of which, is located on or within the area defined by a
line extended 250 feet outward in all directions from the perimeter of the
subject properties. The list of taxpayers shall be compiled from records
maintained by the Champaign County Assessor's Office not more than 30 days
before the opening of the public hearing. The responsibility for obtaining and
providing this information shall be the applicants. The measurement of all
right-of-way shall be excluded in measuring the 250 foot perimeter. If any part
of a condominium property is located within 250 feet of the subject property,
the name of each taxpayer of record for each condominium unit shall also be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator.
         (b)   This represents the statutory requirement for notice of
hearings.
      (2)   Not less than 15 days, but not more than 30 days before a public
hearing, the Zoning Administrator shall give written notice by first class mail
to the following:
         (a)   The applicant.
         (b)   The owners of the subject property for which the zoning action
is sought as identified in accordance with this chapter. If ownership is in a
land trust or partnership, only the trustee or general partner need be
notified.
         (c)   The taxpayers for property within 250 feet of the subject
property as identified in accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The notice shall contain the date, place, and time for the public
hearing on the application, the address of the subject property, a brief
statement of the nature of the request, and the name of the
petitioner. The village shall make a good faith effort to comply with the
requirements of this chapter, however, failure to send the notice will not
invalidate any action by the village.
   (H)   Notice by sign.
      (1)   (a)   An applicant seeking any zoning action for any real estate,
which requires a public hearing, shall allow the village to post weatherproof
signs, indicating the upcoming hearing for the property, which are adequate in
size and number to be visible from the adjacent roadways. The village shall
post the signs approximately ten days prior to the public hearing. A good faith
effort shall be made to keep the signs in place until the close of the public
hearing, but in no case shall the signs remain after ten days from the
completion of the final public hearing.
         (b)   The requirement for posting signs is intended to provide notice
to interested parties in the vicinity of the subject property. The sign would
provide notice to individuals that would be missed by the written notice such
as tenants, homeowners who have tax bills sent to mortgage companies, and
residents outside the 250-foot radius from the property.
      (2)   The required sign shall contain the words "NOTICE OF PUBLIC
HEARING" at the top of the sign. The sign must also indicate the requested
zoning action, date, time, and place where the hearing shall be conducted, a
statement that the public is invited, and the phone number for the village.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator may waive the requirement to post the sign
in cases involving multiple lots where other measures are being used to notify
interested parties. Such waiver shall be made a record of the case.
      (4)   The village shall make a good faith effort to comply with the
requirements of this chapter, however, failure to comply with these
requirements shall not invalidate any zoning action.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.277 HEARINGS AND DECISIONS.
   (A)   Hearings — open meetings. All hearings shall be held in a public place
and shall be open to the public in accordance with state legislation regarding
open meetings. The presence of a majority of the members of the Planning and
Zoning Board shall constitute a quorum at the meeting of the Planning and
Zoning Board. At any hearing, any person may appear and be heard either in

may set its own rules for the conduct of its meetings consistent with the
provisions of the Village of Tolono Municipal Code and the laws of the State of
Illinois.
   (B)   Continuances. Once a public hearing is opened, it shall only be closed
by a majority of a quorum of the hearing body. By its own motion, or on
approval of requests by applicants or their authorized agents, the hearing body
may continue the public hearing from time to time. Continuances shall be
permitted only for good cause, stated in the motion and shall be made to a date
and time certain. If the time and place of the commencement of the next public
hearing is not announced at the scheduled hearing, such continuances shall
require a new public notice in accordance with this subchapter. The applicant
or other interested parties may request no more than two continuances for a
period of not more than 60 days each and not more than 120 days total from the
date the public hearing was opened.
   (C)   Decisions.
      (1)   Decisions of the Planning and Zoning Board on minor variations and
other items noted elsewhere in this chapter shall be final. Decisions of the
Planning and Zoning Board on major variations, map and text amendments,
provisional and special uses, and planned unit developments shall be in the
form of a recommendation to the Village Board of Trustees. The recommendation
shall include any recommended conditions to be placed on the action requested,
if conditions are authorized by this chapter.
      (2)   If the Planning and Zoning Board recommends to the Village Board of
Trustees to approve a petition, the Village Board of Trustees may approve such
petition by a simple majority of the quorum present. If the Planning and Zoning
Board recommends that the petition be denied, the Village Board of Trustees may
only approve such petition by at least a favorable vote of four members of the
Village Board of Trustees. All testimony, exhibits, plans, or specifications
which were considered by the Planning and Zoning Board shall be made a part of
the record of the case.
   (D)   Protest. If a valid written protest against any map amendment,
provisional or special use, or planned unit development is filed with the
Village Clerk, then the action shall only be approved by the favorable vote of
four members of the Village Board of Trustees. A valid protest shall meet the
following criteria:
      (1)   A valid protest shall be filed with the Village Clerk by 5:00 p.m.
three business days before final action by Village Board of Trustees is
scheduled to occur.
      (2)   (a)   A written protest shall be signed by the owners of 40% or
more of either:
            1.   The lots proposed to be altered, or
            2.   The lots, any part of which, are immediately adjoining, across
from an alley or directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered.
         (b)   If any lot or property, which meets the requirements of this
division (D)(2) has multiple owners, such lot shall be counted as protesting if
at least 50% of all owners of such lot signed the protest document.
      (3)   The document shall identify the proposed zoning action, shall
contain a statement of protest against the proposal, and shall attest that the
signatories are the legal owners of property identified therein.
      (4)   The document shall bear the signatures and common street addresses
of those signing the document, and identify the property which each signatory
owns.
(Ord. 2020-O-3, passed 2-18-2020)
§ 154.278 INTERIM DEVELOPMENT.
   Development regulations during consideration.
   (A)   If a petition for a map or text amendment, variation, provisional use,
special use, or planned unit development is filed by the Village Board of
Trustees, Plan Commission, or the Zoning Administrator, then during the period
the case is under consideration no use of any building or land may be changed,
no building permit may be issued, and no building may be erected,
reconstructed, converted, enlarged, structurally altered, or established except
in accordance with the terms of either the existing regulations or the proposed
regulations of the proposed amendment, whichever is more restrictive.
   (B)   The period of consideration shall be determined as beginning the day
after the date of publication of notice as required elsewhere in this
subchapter and ending the day after either:
      (1)   The date the Village Board of Trustees passes or defeats an
ordinance containing all or part of the proposed amendment as published; or
      (2)   The date of publication of notice by the Village Clerk canceling
said notice, whichever date is earlier, but in no event for a period no longer
than 180 days after the date of publication of the notice as required elsewhere
in this subchapter.
