for a stated property have been violated, the Health Authority shall notify the
contractor or person responsible for the work to make such specified changes in
the work to achieve compliance. If such changes are not made within a period of
time specified by the Health Authority, said permit shall be suspended, and
penalty action may be taken. In such cases, the water well system or closed
loop well system may be deemed unsuitable for use, and the system prohibited
from being put into use. In cases involving a potable water supply, the
premises may also be tagged by the Health Authority in accordance with §
50.04.
   (D)   Special evaluations. The Health Department may conduct special
evaluations concerning the operation of existing water supply systems. These
evaluations are generally done for real estate transactions or mortgage
refinancing. Special evaluations are conducted on a consultative basis upon the
request of the property owner or authorized agent. Payment of a fee is required
in order to conduct a special evaluation. The appropriate fee is established by
the Board of Health and is listed on the Health Department fee schedule.
   (E)   Routine water sampling and shipping. The Health Department may collect

shall be approved unless every proposed lot is considered suitable for an
approved private sewage disposal system. A proposed plat of more than six lots
shall not be designed or situated in such a manner which will require private
sewage disposal systems with surface discharges on more than 20% of the
proposed lots. The adequacy of proposed subdivision lots utilizing private
sewage disposal systems shall be determined in part from the results of the
soil type that is identified by soil borings on each proposed lot and through
utilization of the Soil Survey. Information regarding lot size and
configuration along with topographic and other physical features shall also be
used top determine individual lot suitability.
   (A)   Application for plat review. Application for a plat review shall be
made in writing to the Health Department in such form as prescribed by the
Health Authority. Each application shall be accompanied by the plat or proposed
subdivision identifying each lot and accurately depicting the property lines

of the proposed plat shall also be shown. Information concerning topography,
proposed wells, and water supply lines shall also be provided to the Health
Authority upon request.
   (B)   Evaluation of application. The site of the plat or proposed
subdivision shall have corner points of each lot clearly identified prior to
evaluation. At the discretion of the Health Authority, the Health Authority, or
a credentialed soil scientist or soil classifier shall conduct an on-site soils
evaluation over the entire tract. The soil evaluation shall consist of soil
borings made a sufficient number of locations to determine major soil types and
conditions present. If the information provided is insufficient to conduct an
adequate evaluation, the Health Authority may require additional information,
including more detailed soil or engineering studies or aerial photographs. On-
site test pits at certain locations may also be required by the Health
Authority. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant or an authorized
agent of the applicant to obtain all requested data and to design a plat or

among percolation test results, soil classification information obtained from
the soil survey, and/or on-site soil borings as determined by the Health
Authority on an individual basis.
      (3)   Soils information may be supplied to the Health Authority by
qualified soil scientists, consulting engineers, sanitarian, or other
individuals approved by the Health Authority.
      (4)   If the information provided is insufficient to conduct an adequate
evaluation, the Health Authority may require additional information, including
more detailed soil or engineering studies or aerial photographs. On-site test
pits on the subject property may also be required by the Health Authority.
      (5)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant or an authorized
agent of the applicant to obtain all requested data and to design a system
which shall meet the requirements of this subchapter.

hearing at the next regular Board of Health meeting, if the agenda allows. The
petitioner for the hearing shall be notified of the time and place of the
hearing not less than five days prior to the date on which the hearing is to be
held. If, as a result of the hearing, the Board of Health finds that strict
compliance with the decision of the Health Department Administrator would cause
undue hardship on the petitioner and that the public health would be adequately
protected and substantial justice done by granting a variance from the decision
of the Health Department Administrator, the Board of Health may grant a
variance, and as a condition for such variance, may make requirements which are
additional to those prescribed by this subchapter, all for the purpose of
properly protecting the public health. The Board of Health shall render a
decision within ten days after the date of the hearing which shall be reduced

Every nuisance described in §
90.31, upon conviction, may, by order of the court in that action, be abated by
the Sheriff or other proper officer at the expense of the defendant. It is not
a defense to a proceeding under §

law of the state.
      (2)   Any person who violates any provision of §
90.34 shall be guilty of a petty offense and shall be fined not more than $100

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 91.001 SHORT TITLE.

“this chapter.”
(Prior Code, § 5-1-1) (Ord. 2005-1116, passed 11-15-2005)
§ 91.002 POLICY AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   (1)   It has been found by the County Board of Health and the County
Animal Care and Control, that animals that are not controlled by responsible
owners become a hazard to the safety and health of persons.
      (2)   It has also been established that rabies could be present in
wildlife in the county and that rabies vaccination of dog and cat pets is an
important barrier to preventing an epidemic of the disease in pets and thereby
preventing a potential disease problem in the susceptible population of the
county.
   (B)   Registration provides an important means of identifying owners of
biting animals and thereby establishes responsibilities for ten-day
quarantines. The registration fees and fines provide money to pay the costs of
effectuating the Animal Care and Control Program in the county.
   (C)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide harmonious relations in the
interaction between person and animal by:
      (1)   Protecting the citizens of the county from rabies by specifying
such prevention and control measures as may be necessary;
      (2)   Providing security to residents from annoyance, intimidation, and
injury from dogs or other animals;
      (3)   Encouraging responsible pet ownership through education;
      (4)   Protecting animals from improper use, abuse, neglect, inhumane
treatment, and health hazards, particularly rabies; and
      (5)   Providing for the assessment of penalties for violations and for
the enforcement and administration of this chapter, the State Animal Control
Act, being 510 ILCS 5/1, Humane Care for Animals Act, being 510 ILCS 70/1,
Animal Welfare Act, being 225 ILCS 605/1, and the State and Federal Wildlife
Codes.
(Prior Code, § 5-1-1) (Ord. 2005-1116, passed 11-15-2005)
§ 91.003 SCOPE.
   This chapter shall include the following provisions:

and Control;
   (B)   Provisions for impoundment or confinement of biting animals;
   (C)   Duties of owners to responsibly control all domestic animals in their
custody;
   (D)   Duties of owners to treat humanely all domestic animals in their
custody; and
   (E)   Provisions for penalties to persons who violate this chapter, the
State Animal Control Act, Humane Care of Animals Act, Animal Welfare Act, and

§ 117.32 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   The Health Authority shall classify each food service establishment or
retail food store in one of the following three risk categories based upon the
relative risks of causing foodbome illness: high risk, medium risk, and low
risk. Classification criteria for each group are stated in division (D) below.
      (1)   (a)   High risk facilities shall receive three inspections per
year, or two inspections per year if one of the following conditions is met:
            1.   A certified food service manager is present at all times the
facility is in operation; or
            2.   Employees involved in food operations receive a HACCP training
exercise, in-service training on another food service sanitation area, or
attend an educational conference on food safety or sanitation.
         (b)   Medium risk facilities shall receive at least one inspection per
year.
         (c)   Low risk facilities shall receive at least one inspection per
year.
      (2)   Additional inspections of food service establishments or retail
food stores shall be performed as often as deemed necessary by the Health
Authority for the enforcement of this chapter.
   (B)   The Health Authority, after proper identification, shall be permitted
to enter, at any reasonable time, any food service establishment or retail food
store within the county for the purpose of making inspections to determine
compliance with this chapter. The Health Authority shall be permitted to
examine the records of the establishment to obtain information pertaining to
food and supplies purchased, received, or used and persons employed.
   (C)   Whenever an inspection of a food service establishment or retail food
store is made, the findings shall be recorded on an inspection report form. The
inspection report form shall summarize the requirements of this chapter and
shall set forth a weighted point value for each requirement. Inspectional
remarks shall be written to reference, by item number, the item violated, and
shall stated the correction to be made. The rating score of the establishment
shall be the total of the weighted point values for all violations, subtracted
from 100. A copy of the completed inspection report form shall be furnished to
the person in charge of the establishment at the conclusion of the inspection.
The completed inspection report is a pubic document that shall be made
available for public disclosure to any person who requests it, according to
law.
   (D)   For food service establishments or retail food stores shall be based
upon the following classifications and criteria:
      (1)   HIGH RISK means that a facility presents a high-relative risk of
causing foodborne illness based on the large number of food handling operations
typically implicated in foodborne outbreaks and/or the type of population
served by the facility. The following criteria shall be used to classify HIGH
RISK facilities:
         (a)   Whenever cooling of potentially hazardous foods occurs as part
of the food handling operations at the facility;
         (b)   When potentially hazardous foods are prepared hot or cold and
held hot or cold for more than 12 hours before serving;
         (c)   If potentially hazardous foods which have been previously cooked
and cooled must be reheated;
         (d)   When preparing potentially hazardous food for off-premises
service for which time-temperature requirements during transportation, holding,
and service are relevant;
         (e)   Whenever complex preparation of foods, or extensive handling of
raw ingredients with hand contact for ready-to-eat foods, occurs as part of the
food handling operations at the facility;
         (f)   If vacuum packaging and/or other forms of reduced oxygen
packaging are performed at the retail level; or
         (g)   Whenever serving immuno-comprised individuals where these
individuals comprise the majority of the consuming population.
      (2)   MEDIUM RISK means that a facility presents a medium-relative risk
of causing foodborne illness based upon few food handling operations typically
implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks. The following criteria shall be used
to classify MEDIUM RISK facilities:
         (a)   If hot or cold foods are not maintained at that temperature for
more than 12 hours and are restricted to same day service;
         (b)   If preparing foods for service from raw ingredients uses only
minimal assembly; and
         (c)   Foods served at an establishment that requires complex
preparation (whether canned, frozen, or fresh prepared) are obtained from
approved food processing plants, high risk food service establishments, or
retail food stores.
      (3)   LOW RISK means a facility presents a low-relative risk of causing
foodborne illness based upon few or no food handling operations typically
implicated in foodborne illness outbreaks.
         (a)   The following criteria shall be used to classify LOW RISK
facilities:
            1.   Only pre-packaged foods are available or served in the
facility, and any potentially hazardous foods available are commercially pre-
packaged in an approved food processing plant;
            2.   Only limited preparation of non-potentially hazardous foods
and beverages, such as snack foods and carbonated beverages, occurs at the
facility; or
            3.   Only beverages (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) are served at the
facility.
         (b)   The Health Authority may reclassify a facility based upon its
experience with such facility if, in his or her opinion, a health hazard will
not result from such reclassification or such reclassification will provide
better protection for the public. Factors to be used when considering
reclassification of a facility include inspection history, number and frequency
of violations and their severity, and corrective actions taken.
(Prior Code, § 4-1-7) (Ord. passed 4-21-1987; Ord. passed 8-18-1992; Ord.
passed 3-21-1995; Ord. passed 12-16-1997; Ord. passed 8-19-2003)
§ 117.33 CORRECTION OF VIOLATIONS.
   The completed inspection report form shall specify a reasonable period of
time for the correction of the violations found; correction of the violations
shall be accomplished within the period specified, in accordance with the
following provisions.
   (A)   If an imminent health hazard exists, including, but not limited to,
complete lack of refrigeration or sewage backup into the establishment, the
establishment shall immediately cease food service or sales operations.
      (1)   (a)   All violations of four- or five-point weighted items shall be
corrected as soon as possible, but in any event, within ten days following
inspection.
         (b)   Within 15 days after the inspection, the holder of the license
shall notify the Health Authority stating that four- and five-point weighted
violations have been corrected. A follow-up inspection, as deemed necessary by
the Health Authority, shall be conducted to confirm correction.
      (2)   All one- or two-point weighted items shall be corrected as soon as
possible, but in any event, by the time of the next routine inspection.
      (3)   When the rating scare of the establishment is less than 60, the
establishment shall initiate corrective action on all identified violations
within 48 hours. One or more re-inspections will be conducted at reasonable
time intervals to assure correction.
      (4)   In the case of temporary food service establishments, all
violations shall be corrected within 24 hours. If violations are not corrected
within 24 hours, the establishment shall immediately cease food service
operations until authorized to resume by the Health Authority.
   (B)   Failure of the license holder or operator to comply with any time
limits for corrections may result in cessation of food service operations. An
opportunity for hearing on the inspection findings or the time limitations, or
both, will be provided if a written request is filed with the Health
Administrator within ten days following cessation of operations. If a request
for hearing is received, a hearing shall be held within 20 days of receipt of
the request.
   (C)   Whenever a food service establishment or retail food store is required
under the provisions of division (A) above to cease operations, it shall not
resume operations until it is shown on re-inspection that conditions
responsible for the order to cease operations no longer exist. An opportunity
for re-inspection shall be offered within a reasonable time.

§ 117.34 EXAMINATION, CONDEMNATION OF FOOD, EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Food may be examined or sampled by the Health Authority as may be
necessary to determine freedom from adulteration or misbranding. The Health
Authority may, upon written notice to the owner or person in charge, place a
hold order on any food which he or she determines or has probable cause to
believe to be unwholesome or otherwise adulterated or misbranded. Under a hold

   (A)   (1)   These regulations provide for the regulation of matters relative
to the management of stormwater within the county and its unincorporated
jurisdiction. Its provisions include, but are not limited to, regulating
drainage installations and improvements, requiring the preservation and
enhancement of certain natural environmental features, requiring the
installation of drainage improvements in developments, regulating uses,
maintenance, and activities in floodplains and flood hazard areas, requiring
permits, payment of fees, and assurances of completion, and providing for
inspections and control of work.
      (2)   The requirements, standards, and specifications herein provided are
in addition to any other applicable legal requirements.
   (B)   Where any portion of a proposed development activity is within one and
one-half miles of a municipality with a stormwater ordinance, the permittee may
be required, at the discretion of the Zoning and Building Director, to adhere
to the requirements of that municipality. Where more than one municipality with
a stormwater ordinance is within one and one-half miles of any portion of a
proposed development activity, the Zoning and Building Director shall review
the area for a pre-annexation agreement. The permittee may be required, at the
discretion of the Zoning and Building Director, to adhere to the requirements
of that municipality having claimed the area for future annexation. In the
event the municipality claiming the area for annexation declines to provide the
stormwater reviews and inspections, the Zoning and Building Director may
require the permittee to adhere to the requirements of other municipalities
having boundaries within one and one-half miles of any portion of a proposed
development activity. Lacking any other stormwater ordinance, this chapter
shall be binding.

delivered personally or by mail at least 15 days before the time fixed for such
hearing to:
      (1)   The applicant or appellant;
      (2)   To the public works director;
      (3)   To the respective owners of record of property adjoining or
adjacent to the premises in question; and
      (4)   To the Stormwater Manager of all municipalities within one and one-
half miles of the nearest property line of the total project effected. Any
party may appear at such hearing in person or by agent, or by attorney.
   (D)   The re-filing of denied requests for variance or appeals denied by the
Zoning Board of Appeals that are not substantially or materially different from
the previously filed request or appeal shall not be accepted from the same or
different person for the following periods of time:
      (1)   For a six-month period from the date of the first decision by the
Zoning Board of Appeals; or
      (2)   For a one-year period from the date of subsequent decisions by the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (E)   The Zoning and Building Director, or his or her designee, shall
determine whether a request is substantially or materially different and
submittable, although the Zoning Board of Appeals may, by majority vote,
reverse a decision of the Zoning and Building Director, or his or her designee,
to not accept a request following a denied request or appeal.
   (F)   The Zoning and Building Director, or his or her designee, will review
and transmit recommendations to the Zoning Board of Appeals, which shall review
such recommendations prior to granting or denying the variance. In the event a
notice of objection is received from a Stormwater Manager of any municipality
within one and one-half miles of the nearest property line of the total project
effected, deference shall be given to the objecting municipality by the Zoning
Board of Appeals in considering a decision.

§ 152.141 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not vary the requirements and
regulations of this chapter unless evidence is presented that proves that all
of the following three situations exist.
      (1)   The land in question is of such shape or size, or is affected by
such physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations or record,
that it is impossible or impractical for the applicant to comply with all of
the requirements of this chapter; financial concerns shall not be a
consideration for this standard.
      (2)   The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the applicant.
      (3)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare, environment, or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the
subject’s property.

§ 152.158 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.
   BMPs shall be implemented to prevent the release of sediment from
construction sites. Disturbed areas shall be minimized, disturbed soil shall be
managed, and construction site entrances shall be managed to prevent sediment
tracking. Excessive sediment tracked onto public streets shall be removed
immediately.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.159 CONTINUED COMPLIANCE.
   Upon completion of permitted construction activity on any site, the property
owner and subsequent property owners will be responsible for continued
compliance with the requirements of this chapter in the course of maintenance,
reconstruction, or any other construction activity on the site.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.160 USE OF BMPS.
   Use of BMPs identified by this chapter, or the use of any other BMPs
submitted for approval by the permittee as a substitute, will be a requirement
of this chapter in obtaining approval for subdivisions, building permits, and
grading and drainage permits. Their use will also present an opportunity (in
some cases, when allowed by ordinance) for the permittee to receive credits
against their stormwater utility fees. This list of definitions is not
exclusive and developers are encouraged to submit alternative BMPs for approval
by the Zoning and Building Director, or his or her designee.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.161 PRESERVING REGULATORY FLOODPLAINS; FLOODPRONE AND WETLAND AREAS.
   (A)   Buffer zones. An area along a shoreline, wetland, or stream where
development is restricted or prohibited. The primary function of aquatic
buffers is to physically protect and separate a stream, lake, or wetland from
future disturbance or encroachment. The three types of buffers are water
pollution hazard setbacks, vegetated buffers, and engineered buffers.
   (B)   Conservation easements. Voluntary agreements that allow an individual
or group to set aside private property to limit the type or amount of
development on their property. The conservation easement can cover all or a
portion of a property and can either be permanent or last for a specified time.
The easement is typically described in terms of the resource it is designed to
protect (for example, agricultural, forest, historic, or open space easements)
and explains and mandates the restrictions on the uses of the particular
property.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.162 MINIMIZING IMPERVIOUS SURFACES ON THE PROPERTY.
   (A)   Open space design, conservation development, planned urban development
(PUD).
      (1)   A better site design technique that concentrates dwelling units in
a compact area in one portion of the development site in exchange for providing
open space and natural areas in place of buildable area elsewhere on the site.
      (2)   The minimum lot sizes, setbacks, and frontage distances for the
residential zone are relaxed in order to create the open space.
   (B)   Narrower streets.
      (1)   In many residential settings, streets can be as narrow as 22 to 26
feet wide without sacrificing emergency access, on street parking, or vehicular
and pedestrian safety.
      (2)   Even narrower access streets or shared driveways can be used when
only a handful of homes need to be served. Use of narrower streets will only be
allowed on public streets by requesting a variance from Chapter 153 of this
code of ordinances or in conjunction with the development of a PUD.
   (C)   Eliminating curbs and gutters. Elimination of curbs and gutters
involves the use of grass swales and ditches as an alternative to curbs and
gutters along residential streets. Eliminating curbs and gutters from public
streets will only be allowed by requesting a variance from Chapter 153 of this
code of ordinances or in conjunction with the development of a PUD.
   (D)   Alternative turnarounds. Alternative turnarounds are designs for end
of street vehicle turnaround that replace cul-de-sacs and reduce the amount of
impervious cover created in residential neighborhoods. Numerous alternatives
create less impervious cover than the traditional 40-foot cul-de-sac. These
alternatives include reducing cul-de-sacs to a 30-foot radius and creating
hammerheads, loop roads, and pervious islands in the cul-de-sac center by
requesting a variance from Chapter 153 of this code of ordinances or in
conjunction with the development of a PUD.
   (E)   Alternative pavers. Alternative pavers are permeable surfaces that can
replace asphalt and concrete and can be used for driveways, parking lots, and
walkways. Commercially available pavers are used which contain void spaces for
grass or clean, washed stone or gravel. Gravel, cobble, or mulch parking lots
are prohibited except for development of one un-attached single-family dwelling
private driveway.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.163 STORMWATER WETLANDS, GRASSED SWALES, VEGETATED FILTER STRIPS.
   (A)   Stormwater wetlands.
      (1)   Stormwater wetlands (also known as constructed wetlands) are
structural practices similar to wet ponds that incorporate wetland plants into
the design. Stormwater wetlands are designed specifically for the purpose of
treating stormwater runoff.
      (2)   A distinction should be made between using a constructed wetland
for stormwater management and diverting stormwater into a natural wetland.
      (3)   The latter practice is not recommended because altering the
hydrology of the existing wetland with additional stormwater can degrade the
resource and result in plant die off and the destruction of wildlife habitat.
   (B)   Grassed swales. The term SWALE (also known as GRASSED CHANNEL, DRY
SWALE, WET SWALE, or BIO-FILTER) refers to a series of vegetated, open channel
management practices designed specifically to treat and attenuate stormwater
runoff for a specified water quality volume. As stormwater runoff flows through
these channels, it is treated through filtering by the vegetation in the
channel, filtering through a subsoil matrix, and/or infiltration into the
underlying soils.
   (C)   Vegetated filter strips. Vegetated surfaces that are designed to treat
sheet flow from adjacent surfaces. Filter strips function by slowing runoff
velocities and filtering out sediment and other pollutants.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.164 INFILTRATING RUNOFF ON SITE.
   (A)   Sand and organic filters. Sand filters are usually two chambered
stormwater practices; the first is a settling chamber, and the second is a
filter bed filled with sand or another filtering media. As stormwater flows
into the first chamber, large particles settle out, and then finer particles
and other pollutants are removed as stormwater flows through the filtering
medium. There are several modifications of the basic sand filter design,
including the surface sand filter, underground sand filter, perimeter sand
filter, organic media filter, and multi-chamber treatment train.
   (B)   Infiltration trenches. An infiltration trench is a rock filled trench
with no outlet that receives stormwater runoff. Stormwater runoff passes
through some combination of pretreatment measures, such as a swale and
detention basin, and into the trench. There, runoff is stored in the void space
between the stones and infiltrates through the bottom and into the soil matrix.
   (C)   Infiltration basins. A shallow impoundment which is designed to
infiltrate stormwater into the groundwater. Infiltration basins should only be
used on small drainage areas (less than ten acres), and where soils are highly
permeable.
   (D)   Porous pavements. Porous pavement is a permeable pavement surface with
an underlying stone reservoir to temporarily store surface runoff before it
infiltrates into the subsoil. This porous surface replaces traditional
pavement, allowing parking lot stormwater to infiltrate directly and receive
water quality treatment. There are a few porous pavement options, including
porous asphalt, pervious concrete, and grass pavers.
   (E)   Bio-retention.
      (1)   Bio-retention areas are landscaping features adapted to provide on-
site treatment of stormwater runoff. They are commonly located in parking lot
islands or within small pockets of residential land uses. Surface runoff is
directed into shallow, landscaped depressions. These depressions are designed
to incorporate many of the pollutant removal mechanisms that operate in
forested ecosystems. During storms, runoff ponds above the mulch and soil in
the system. Runoff from larger storms is generally diverted past the facility
to the storm drain system.
      (2)   The remaining runoff filters through the mulch and prepared soil
mix. Typically, the filtered runoff is collected in a perforated under drain
and returned to the storm drain system.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.165 PROVIDING STORMWATER RETENTION STRUCTURES.
   (A)   On lot treatment. A series of practices that are designed to collect
runoff from individual residential or small commercial lots. The primary
purpose of most on lot practices is to manage rooftop runoff and, to a lesser
extent, driveway and sidewalk runoff. Although there are a wide variety of on
lot treatment options, they can all be classified into one of three categories:
      (1)   Practices that collect and infiltrate rooftop runoff;
      (2)   Practices that divert runoff or soil moisture to a pervious area;
and
      (3)   Practices that store runoff for later use.
   (B)   Retention basins.
      (1)   Retention basins that are designed to collect and hold stormwater
runoff, with no outlet pipes or structures. They are not necessarily
infiltration basins, and are best designed to rely mostly on evaporation.
      (2)   Retention basins are only feasible when special circumstances of
land and soil type are available.

§ 152.166 PROVIDING WET OR WETLAND DETENTION STRUCTURES.
   Defined and controlled under §§
152.220 through
152.235.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.167 PROVIDING DRY DETENTION STRUCTURES.
   Defined and controlled under §§
152.220 through
152.235. Detention basins shall be designed to remove floatables from
stormwater runoff by providing trash grates or special outlet structures which
separate floatables.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.168 CONSTRUCTING STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   Manufactured products for stormwater inlets. A variety of products for
stormwater inlets known as swirl separators, or hydrodynamic structures. Swirl
separators are modifications of the traditional oil-grit separator and include
an internal component that creates a swirling motion as stormwater flows
through a cylindrical chamber. The concept behind these designs is that
sediments settle out as stormwater moves in this swirling path. Additional
compartments or chambers are sometimes present to trap oil and other
floatables. There are several different types of proprietary separators, each
of which incorporates slightly different design variations, such as offline
application.
   (B)   Catch basin inserts. Catch basin efficiency can be improved using
commercially-available inserts, which can be designed to remove oil and grease,
trash, debris, and sediment. Some inserts are designed to drop directly into
existing catch basins, while others may require being installed as part of the
construction of the basin.
   (C)   In line storage structures. In-line storage refers to a number of
practices designed to use the storage within the storm drain system to detain
flows. Storage is achieved by placing devices in the storm drain system to
restrict the rate of flow. Devices can slow the rate of flow by backing up
flow, as in the case of a dam or weir, or through the use of vortex valves,
devices that reduce flow rates by creating a helical flow path in the
structure.
(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.169 WATER QUALITY AND MULTIPLE USES.
   The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse surface and
groundwater quality impacts off site and on the property itself. Detention
basins shall incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff
pollutants. All flows from the development shall be routed through the basin
(for example, low flows shall not be bypassed). Detention of stormwater shall
be promoted throughout the property’s drainage system to reduce the volume of
stormwater runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants. The drainage
system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered
compatible with stormwater management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic
habitat, recreation (boating, fishing, trails, playing fields), wetlands, and
water quality mitigation.

GRADING AND DRAINAGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS
§ 152.180 PERMIT EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Except as exempted below, no person shall commence construction prior
to obtaining the appropriate grading and drainage permit as defined below. The
Zoning and Building Director, or his or her designee, shall issue grading and
drainage permits. In order to preclude inappropriate phasing of developments to
circumvent the intent of this chapter, when a proposed development activity
will occur on a lot or parcel of land that has contiguous lots or parcels of
lands owned by the same property owner, then the criteria as defined in this
section will be applied to the total land area compiled from aggregate
ownership parcels.
   (B)   (1)   A grading and drainage permit shall not be required for the
following:
         (a)   Any construction activity below the minimum thresholds for a
Class 1 grading and drainage permit;
         (b)   The agricultural use of land, including the implementation of
conservation measures included in a farm conservation plan approved by the
Natural Resources Conservation Service, and including the construction of
agricultural structures;
         (c)   The maintenance of any existing stormwater control facility
including dredging, levee restoration, tree removal, or other function that
maintains the original design capacities of the facility;
         (d)   The construction of, improvements to, or the maintenance of any
street, road, highway, or interstate highway, or other public infrastructure
performed by the county. However the requirements of this chapter will be
honored by the county for such improvements; and
         (e)   The construction of or improvements to residential accessory
structures (for example, carports, garages, pole barns, and the like).
      (2)   However, all other requirements of this chapter are still required.

§ 152.181 CLASS 1 GRADING AND DRAINAGE PERMIT.
   Any construction that will include the addition of an impervious surface
area (for example, streets, commercial roofs, patio, or parking area, new
single-family dwellings, or any combination thereof) greater than 1,000 square
feet and less than 10,000 square feet requires a Class 1 grading and drainage
permit. The issuance of a grading and drainage permit shall constitute an
authorization to do only that work which is described on the approved sketch. A
Class 1 grading and drainage permit shall be valid for one year after the date
of issuance.
(Ord. passed - -; Ord. passed 1-21-2014)
§ 152.182 CLASS 2 GRADING AND DRAINAGE PERMIT.
   (A)   The drainage system for a parcel containing the proposed construction
site shall be designed to restrict the peak rate of discharge from the total
parcel (one-hour storm once a year) to pre-project levels. The Zoning and
Building Director, or his or her designee, may require the petitioner to
provide pre- and post-project peak discharge rates, showing the peak flows and
retention/detention rates using accepted methodology, including the Illinois
Urban Manual. If the post-development peak discharge rate must be reduced, the
Zoning and Building Director, or his or her designee, will recommend
appropriate stormwater control options. If a mutually-acceptable option cannot
be developed, the appeal process outlined in §§
152.140 through
152.142 will be followed. The issuance of a grading and drainage permit shall
constitute an authorization to do only that work which is described on the
approved sketch. A Class 2 grading and drainage permit shall be valid for one
year after the date of issuance.
   (B)   Any construction that meets one of the following thresholds shall
require a Class 2 grading and drainage permit.
      (1)   Any construction that will include the addition of an impervious
surface area (for example, streets, roof, patio, or parking area, or any
combination thereof) greater than or equal to 10,000 square feet and less than
one acre (43,560 square feet).
      (2)   Any land disturbing activity (for example, clearing, grading,
stripping, excavation, fill, or any combination thereof) that will affect an
area greater than or equal to 10,000 square feet and less than one acre (43,560
square feet).
      (3)   Any land disturbing activity that will exceed 100 cubic yards, but
does not otherwise require a Class 3 grading and drainage permit.

   (A)   (1)   The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to minimize and
facilitate maintenance. Use of native vegetation is strongly encouraged to
reduce maintenance, increase wildlife habitat, and to provide other benefits.
Where nonnative vegetation is used, turfed side slopes shall be designed to
allow lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins shall be
provided with alternate outflows, which can be used to completely drain the
pool for sediment removal. Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is
not feasible.
      (2)   Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible, for
localizing sediment deposition and removal. Site access for heavy equipment
shall be provided. A maintenance plan for the ongoing maintenance of all
stormwater management system components including wetlands is required prior to

§ 152.208 PROVISIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE.
   (A)   Existing easements for any agricultural drainage systems located
underneath areas that will be developed shall be preserved. If no such easement
exists, an easement shall be dedicated for access and maintenance as provided
for in this chapter.
   (B)   All agricultural drainage systems that serve upstream areas outside of
the development and that are located underneath areas that will be developed
shall be replaced with non-perforated conduit to prevent root blockage,
provided, however, that the existing drainage district system may remain in
place with the approval of the appropriate entity.
   (C)   Agricultural drainage systems that, due to development, will be
located underneath streets, driveways, and other paved areas, as allowed by
this chapter, shall be replaced with conduits meeting the county’s, or
designees’, standard specifications as needed to prevent the collapse of the
agricultural drainage conduit.
   (D)   Agricultural drainage systems may be relocated within the development
area upon the approval of the Zoning and Building Director, or his or her
designee. Such relocation shall maintain sufficient slope and capacity to
prevent sedimentation and to prevent an increase in scouring or structural
damage to the conduit. Such relocation shall only be with the consent and
approval of the appropriate entity responsible for the system. If the system is
not under the authority of a drainage district, the Zoning and Building
Director, or his or her designee, shall consider the interests of those
landowners who are served by the system.

§ 152.225 GENERAL BASIN DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Erosion control. Temporary and permanent erosion control shall be
required for all detention basins in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Verification and final approval.
      (1)   Erosion protection shall be inspected throughout the project
duration.
      (2)   Detention basin storage volume shall be verified to the
satisfaction of the Zoning and Building Director, or his or her designee,
through as built surveys or other means.
      (3)   Inflow, outflow, and emergency overflow elevations shall be
verified through as built surveys.
      (4)   Final vegetative cover and permanent erosion control shall be
inspected for completeness of cover.
      (5)   The basin will receive final approval upon fulfillment of divisions
(B)(2), (B)(3), and (B)(4) above, and the anniversary date of maintenance and
repair reporting will be recorded as such.
      (6)   All basins must receive final approval within 90 days of the
substantial completion as determined by the Zoning and Building Director, or
his or her designee, of any of the following:
         (a)   The first phase (as shown on approved plans) of construction of
public utilities and roadways in any approved subdivision project. Detention
structures for the ultimate development area must be constructed during the
first phase of the project, and approved at its completion. The detention
structures must then be maintained and repaired in conformance with this
chapter, during future construction phases.
         (b)   Parking areas, floor slabs, or other impervious areas (as shown
on approved plans, and not including sidewalks) for work on an individual lot
requiring an individual permit under this chapter. Phased construction will be
treated as in the above case.
         (c)   Mass earthwork or rough grading if no other phased construction
is scheduled to be started within 180 days.
      (7)   Failure to receive final approval as required will be considered a
violation of this chapter.
   (C)   Infiltration practices. To effectively reduce runoff volumes,
infiltration practices, including basins, trenches, and porous pavement, shall
follow criteria in the Illinois Urban Manual and other relevant permitting. An
appropriate sediment control device shall be provided to remove coarse sediment
from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches.
Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over 80% of the dry
basin’s bottom area for the maximum design event to be exfiltrated. The bottom
of infiltration basins or trenches shall be a minimum of three feet above the
seasonally high groundwater and bedrock level if practicable. Engineering
calculations demonstrating infiltration rates shall be included with the
application.
   (D)   Side slopes. The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year, 24-
hour capacity should be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls
into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of
detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than three to one,
horizontal to vertical; certain types of basins have different requirements as
defined by this chapter. Detention basin side slopes above normal pool
elevation shall be designed with permanent erosion protection consisting of
grass, non-grass vegetation, or other permanent finish. At least six inches of
topsoil must be provided on side slopes above normal pool elevation whenever
nonstructural, permanent erosion control is not being used. Permanent erosion
protection shall be aesthetically suitable to the development or existing
surrounding land use.
   (E)   Overflow structures. All stormwater detention basins shall be provided
with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a stage at
least one foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the
detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be
equivalent to the 100-year, 24-hour inflow rate. Weirs, dams, and specialized
outflows shall be designed by a professional engineer registered in the state.
   (F)   Detention basin outlet design.
      (1)   Backwater. Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream
drainage system shall be addressed when designing the outlet.
      (2)   Minimum detention outlet size. Where a single pipe outlet or
orifice plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum
diameter of 12 inches. If design release rates call for smaller outlets, a
design that minimizes the possibility of clogging shall be used.
   (G)   Other design requirements.
      (1)   “Bubble up” outlets are prohibited.
      (2)   Pumped outlets and other active control structures are discouraged
and must be preapproved on a case-by-case basis by the Zoning and Building
Director, or his or her designee.
      (3)   Temporary erosion techniques shall be used as required to ensure a
full stand of cover vegetation in minimum time.
   (H)   Location requirements.
      (1)   In subdivisions, detention basins and their 100-year design high
water shall be contained within platted lots dedicated for drainage purposes.
In redevelopments, detention basins and their 100-year design high water shall
be contained within a drainage easement.
      (2)   Detention basin lots shall have a minimum of 20 feet of frontage on
a right-of-way for the purpose of providing unrestricted access for
maintenance. Exceptions may be made for infill development.
      (3)   A 20-foot minimum setback shall be required from all property lines
to the normal pool elevation, which is considered to be the elevation of the
water level at the permanent depth of the wet basin pool rather than the
temporary depth during drainage events.
      (4)   Detention basins shall be provided with a minimum of one foot of
freeboard above the 100-year design water elevation.
      (5)   There shall be at least two feet of freeboard between the 100-year
design water elevation and all boundaries of the parcel or easement containing
the basin.
   (I)   Accommodating flows from upstream tributary areas. Stormwater runoff
from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design of the
property’s drainage system. Flows from upstream areas that are not to be
detained should be routed around the basin being provided for the site being
developed.
   (J)   Upstream areas not meeting chapter requirements. When there are areas
not meeting the storage and release rates of this chapter, tributary to the
applicant’s property, the following steps shall be followed:
      (1)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his or
her property using the release rates and procedures described in this chapter;
      (2)   The areas tributary to the applicant’s property, not meeting the
storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, shall be identified;
      (3)   Using the areas determined above plus the applicant’s property
area, total storage and release rates needed for the combined properties shall
be computed using the release rates and procedures described in this chapter.
If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover,
based on local zoning, shall be used for the purposes of computing storage;
      (4)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed the county, or its
designee, may choose to pay for oversizing the applicant’s detention basin to
accommodate the regional flows. The applicant’s responsibility will be limited
to the storage for his or her property as computed above. If regional storage
is selected by the county, or its designee, the Zoning and Building Director,
or his or her designee, will work with the applicant to implement the
requirements of this chapter. If regional storage is rejected by the county, or
its designee, the applicant shall bypass all tributary area flows around the
applicant’s basin whenever practicable as determined by the Zoning and Building
Director, or his or her designee. If the applicant must route upstream flows
through his or her basin and the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size,
the applicant must meet the provisions of §
152.229(C).
   (K)   Upstream areas meeting chapter requirements. When there are areas
which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, and
tributary to the applicant’s property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed
around the applicant’s detention basin if this is the only practicable
alternative as determined by the Zoning and Building Director, or his or her
designee. Storage needed for the applicant’s property shall be computed as
described in this chapter. However, if the county, or its designee, decides to
route tributary area flows through an applicant’s basin, the final design
stormwater releases shall be based on the combined total of the applicant’s
property plus tributary areas. It must be shown that at no time will the runoff
rate from the applicant’s property exceed the allowable release rate for his or
her property alone.
   (L)   Early completion of detention facilities. Where detention or retention
are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be
constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded
sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant on a
regular basis and before project completion in order to maintain the design
volume of the facilities.

§ 152.226 WET DETENTION BASIN DESIGN.
   Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to
be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available
for recreational use.
   (A)   Wet basin depths. Wet basins shall be at least three feet deep,
excluding near-shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided
they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25% of the bottom area to prevent
winter kill.
   (B)   Wet basin shoreline slopes. The side slopes of wet basins at the
normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than five to one horizontal to
vertical. It is recommended that native aquatic vegetation be established
around the perimeter to provide protection from shoreline erosion. Slopes below
a depth of eight feet are permitted to be two to one, in accordance with IDOT
Standard Specifications, § 204.

      (1)   The distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be
maximized. Inlets and outlets shall be at opposite ends of the basin, providing
that the orientation does not create undue hardship based on topography or
other natural constraints. Designers are encouraged to use baffles or berms in
the basin bottom to prevent short circuiting.
      (2)   There shall be no low flow bypass between the inlet and outlet. The
minimum flow length shall be ten feet with a recommended minimum ratio of two
to one for width.
   (E)   Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge
at least four feet in width two and one-half to three feet below the normal
water depth.
   (F)   Aeration. Wet bottom basins shall have a natural or artificial means
of aeration.
   (G)   Dewatering. An outlet structure shall be provided to allow dewatering
of the pond for maintenance. Gravity dewatering is strongly preferred.
   (H)   Soil permeability. Wet bottom basin design shall include an evaluation
of soil permeability. A basin liner shall be included in the design if needed
to ensure water retention to normal pool elevation.
   (I)   Detention/sedimentation. It is encouraged that consideration of
routing runoff from the development through a stilling basin be considered.

designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically
pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple uses.
   (A)   Dry basin drainage.
      (1)   Dry basins shall be designed so that 80% of their bottom area shall
have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event less than the
100-year, 24-hour event. Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the wet
portion of the basin bottom.
      (2)   Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used to accomplish this
requirement.
   (B)   Minimum bottom slope. Dry bottom basins shall have 2% minimum bottom
slopes or underdrain systems as approved by Zoning and Building Director, or
his or her designee.
   (C)   Low flow channel. Dry bottom basins may include a low flow channel
with some form of erosion protection.
   (D)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets
and to minimize re-suspension of pollutants.
   (E)   Dry basin inlet and outlet orientation. Dry basin inlet and outlet
orientation shall be the same as for wet basins.

(Ord. passed - -)
§ 152.229 DETENTION IN FLOODPLAINS.
   The placement of detention basins within the floodplain is strongly
discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation during flood
events. However, the stormwater detention requirements of this chapter may be
fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe areas on the
project site, provided the following provisions are met as well as all required
state, federal, and local permits:
   (A)   Detention in flood fringe areas. The placement of a detention basin in
a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for one and one-half
times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention
basin, including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided
shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this subchapter.
The applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all stream flow and
floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along
watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention.
All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall
be replaced below the existing ten-year elevation. All floodplain storage lost
above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the
existing ten-year flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
   (B)   Detention in floodways. Detention basins shall be placed in the
floodway only in accordance with division (C) below.
   (C)   On-stream detention. On-stream detention basins are discouraged but
allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other
provisions of this chapter with respect to water quality and control of the
five-year and 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. The volume of
detention shall be provided in addition to the existing stream floodway
storage. Further criteria are presented in §
152.230. If on stream detention is used in watersheds larger than one square
mile, the applicant will use hydrographic modeling to demonstrate that the
design will not increase the water level for any properties upstream or
downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on
stream detention:
      (1)   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which
require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
      (2)   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality
or stream aquatic habitat;
      (3)   Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes, appropriate
bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin;
      (4)   Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of
wetlands;
      (5)   Shall require the implementation of an effective non-point source
management program throughout the upstream watershed, which shall include as a
minimum, runoff reduction best management practices (BMPs) consistent with
division (A) above;
      (6)   Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge; and
      (7)   Shall not contribute to the duration or flood frequency of any
adjacent land.

§ 152.230 DRAINAGE INTO WETLANDS, RIVERS, STREAMS, LAKES, PONDS, AND AREAS.
   (A)   Detention in wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, or ponds. Existing
wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, or ponds shall not be modified for the
purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the proposed
modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform
beneficial functions, and shall comply with other relevant permitting. Existing
storage and release rate characteristics of wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes,
or ponds shall be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to
meet the requirements of this division (A) shall be in addition to this
existing storage.
   (B)   Sediment control. The existing wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, or
ponds shall be protected during construction and as further regulated §§
152.001 through
152.004 and 152.020 through 152.027.
   (C)   Alteration of drainage patterns. Site drainage patterns shall not be
altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to
wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes, or ponds. Drainage patterns shall not be
altered by development to direct runoff off site to other than natural drainage
outlets existing prior to development.
   (D)   Detention/sedimentation. All runoff from the development shall be
routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture
the two-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours before being
discharged to the basin. This basin shall be constructed before property
grading begins and shall be maintained throughout the construction process. In
addition, the BMP hierarchy defined in section 3-5 of this article should be
followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged.
   (E)   Vegetated buffer strip. A buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width,
preferably vegetated with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored
around the periphery of a wetland, river, stream, lake, or pond.

§ 152.255 GENERAL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL DESIGN FEATURES.
   The following principles shall apply to all construction undertaken under
the authorization of a Class 3 grading and drainage permit.
   (A)   New development or redevelopment shall be designed to create the least
potential for erosion. The disturbance of slopes greater than 7% should be
avoided wherever possible. Natural contours should be followed as closely as
possible.
   (B)   Natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and wetlands
are to be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of
watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures.
   (C)   Special precautions shall be taken to prevent damages resultant from
any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake,
pond, or wetland. Preventive measures shall reflect the sensitivity of these
areas to erosion and sedimentation.
   (D)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (E)   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other
appropriate sediment or runoff control measures shall be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
from land undergoing development.
   (F)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance must be considered.
   (G)   Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainage ways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on site or
downstream.
   (H)   Permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed and functional
as soon as practical during development. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized
with approved permanent measures within seven calendar days following the end
of active disturbance or re-disturbance.
   (I)   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land
uses shall be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
   (J)   All waste generated as a result of site development activity shall be
properly disposed of and shall be prevented from being carried off the site by
either wind or water.
   (K)   All construction sites shall provide measures to prevent sediment from
being tracked onto public or private roadways.
   (L)   All temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained to function as intended until the contributing drainage area has
been permanently stabilized, at which time they shall be removed within 30 days
after final site stabilization.

such Deed, is deemed to covenant and agree to pay to the Association: (1) annual
assessments or charges, such assessments to be established and collected from time to
time as hereinafter provided. The term “Improved Lot” shall mean any lot having a

attorney’s fees for collection, shall also be the personal obligation of the person
or entity who was the owner of such property at the time the assessment fell due. The
personal obligation for delinquent assessments shall not pass to his successors in
title unless expressly assumed by them.

exclusively to maintain the stormwater detention basin system, as provided for under
the Restrictive and Protective Covenants of The Board of Directors of the Association
shall establish a budget by January 1st of each year and shall levy an assessment

The Board of Directors of the Association shall fix the amount of the annual
assessment against each lot at least 30 days in advance of each annual assessment
period. Written notice of the annual assessment shall be sent to every Owner subject
thereto. The annual assessment shall be paid in one annual payment, and the due dates
and delinquency dates shall be uniformly established by the Board of Directors of the
Association. The Association shall, upon demand, and for a reasonable charge, furnish
a certificate signed by an officer of the Association setting forth whether the
assessments on a specified Lot are current or delinquent. Such certificate shall be
conclusive evidence of payment of any assessment therein stated to have been paid.
6.   Effect of Non-payment of Assessments: Remedies of the Association. Any annual
payment not paid within 30 days after the due date shall bear interest from the date
of delinquency at the rate of 10% per annum. The Association may bring any action at
law against the Owner personally obligated to pay the same, or foreclose the lien
against the property by an action in equity. In any such action, interest, costs and
reasonable attorneys fees shall be added to the amount of the delinquent assessment
and collected as part of said judgment. In the event of such foreclosure, if the
Association waives any and all rights to a deficiency judgment against the Owner, the
period for redemption as provided by the statutes of the State of Illinois shall be
reduced to six months from the date of foreclosure sale. Any lot ultimately acquired
by the Association through Judges Deed after such a foreclosure shall be sold by the
Association within a reasonable time either at public or private sale, and any
surplus remaining after the payment of assessments, interest, costs and attorney’s
fees shall be paid over to the former Owner of said Lot. No Owner may waiver or
otherwise escape liability for the assessments provided for herein by non-use of the
Detention Basin or by abandonment of his Lot.
7.   Subordination of the Lien to Mortgages. The lien of the assessments provided for
herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first mortgage placed upon any Lot.
Sale or transfer of any Lot shall not affect the assessment lien. However, the sale
or transfer of any lot pursuant to Mortgage foreclosure or any assessments as to
payments which became due prior to such sale or transfer, provided that such sale or
transfer shall not extinguish the personal obligation of the prior Owner or his
heirs, successors or assigns, for payment of such assessment. No sale or transfer
shall relieve such Lot from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due or
from the lien thereof.
ARTICLE V
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.   Enforcement. The Association, or any Owner shall have the right to enforce by
any proceeding at law or in equity all restrictions, conditions, covenants or
reservations now or hereafter imposed by the provisions of this Declaration. The
Association shall have the sole right to enforce, by proceedings at law or in equity,
the liens and charges now or hereafter imposed by the provisions of this Declaration.

herein contained shall in no event be deemed a waiver of the right to do so

judgment or Court Order shall in no way affect any other provisions which shall
remain in full force and effect.
3.   Duration. The covenants and restrictions of this Declaration shall run with and

   (F)   Standards for variances.
      (1)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not vary the regulations of this
chapter, as authorized in this section, unless there is evidence presented to
it in each specific case that:
         (a)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
         (b)   The conditions, upon which a petition for a variation is based,
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
         (c)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make money out of the property;
         (d)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this chapter and
has not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the
property;
         (e)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located;

light and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of
the public streets increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or

facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of
the same days of the week;
      (5)   To reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the
districts whenever the character or use of a building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely being granted for a convenience;
      (6)   To permit the alteration or enlargement of an existing building or
use located on premises
in a district which prohibits that use of land or building, or the height and
area of buildings existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter where

structure existing at the time of the adoption, amendment, or change of this
chapter; and

been damaged by
explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent of more than 50%
of its actual cash value, as determined by the official county tax assessment
and equalization rate, where the Board finds some compelling public necessity
requiring a continuance of the non- conforming use, and the primary purpose of
continuing the non-conforming use is not to continue a monopoly; and
      (8)   To permit other variances as authorized in §
154.618.
   (H)   Findings of fact. All decisions by the Zoning Board of Appeals on
requests for variances must be supplemented with a written finding of fact

throughout the county; and lessening or avoiding congestion in the public
streets and highways, the County Board may from time to time in the manner
hereinafter set forth amend the regulations imposed in the districts created by
this chapter. The chapter may be amended, provided that in all amendatory
resolutions adopted under the authority of this section, due allowance shall be

direction of building development to the best advantages of the entire county,
and the uses to which the property is devoted at the time of the adoption of
such amendatory chapter.
   (B)   Initiation of amendment. Amendments may be proposed by the County
Board, Zoning Board of Appeals, or by any interested person or organization.

copy upon the applicant’s attorney, if any, by certified mail at the address of
such applicant and attorney shown in the application for the proposed
amendment.

(Ord. passed 5-16-2023)
§ 154.023 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Authority.
      (1)   The development and administration of this chapter is based upon
the division of the county into zoning districts, within which districts the
use of land and buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and
structures in relation to the land, are substantially uniform.
      (2)   It is recognized, however, that there are certain uses that may
have unique, special, or unusual impact upon the use or enjoyment of
neighboring property and planned developments and cannot be properly classified
in any particular district or districts without consideration in each
individual case. A use may be permitted in one or more zoning districts and a
special use in one or more other zoning districts. Such cases are classified in
this chapter as special uses and fall into two categories:
         (a)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest; and
         (b)   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Initiation of special use. Any person having a freehold interest in
land, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual
interest which may become a freehold interest of an exclusive possessory
character, any of which is specifically enforceable, may file an application to
use such land for one or more of the special uses provided for in this chapter
in the zoning district in which the land is located.
   (C)   Application for special use.
      (1)   An application for a special use shall be filed with the
Administrative Officer on a form as he or she shall prescribe. The application
required by the Administrative Officer shall, at a minimum, include the
substance of the applicant’s proposal. The applicant shall also disclose in
writing the applicant’s interest in real estate in any of the property
adjoining and adjacent to the subject site property lot lines. The applicant’s
hearing presentation of the special use application shall be restricted to the
general substance of the application as initially filed with the Administrative
Officer. This restriction is not intended to limit the applicant’s responses
during any hearing, nor is it intended to restrict the presentation of project
details or other information within the general substance of the application.
The filing of the application and the notices required in division (E) below
shall be construed as jurisdictional requirements. The application shall be
accompanied by such plans and/or data prescribed by the Zoning Board of Appeals
and shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence
showing that the proposed special use will conform to the standards set forth
in division (F) below.
      (2)   Such application shall be forwarded from the Administrative Officer
to the Zoning Board of Appeals with a request for a public hearing and report
relative thereto. All documents filed by the applicant or other interested
persons shall be date stamped or otherwise marked by the Administrative
Officer, and the Administrative Officer shall keep a separate file of the
special use application, with a docket sheet adequately describing each
document filed by the applicant or otherwise submitted by objectors and other
interested persons.
   (D)   Hearing an application.
      (1)   Upon receipt in proper form of the application and statement
referred to in division (C) above, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold at
least one public hearing on the proposed special use. The hearing shall be
preserved in such manner as the Zoning Board of Appeals shall, by rule,
prescribe from time to time.
      (2)   All testimony by witnesses in any hearing shall be given under
oath. The oath shall be administered to each witness and shall not be
administered to a group of persons. Each witness shall be duly identified on
the record at the time of taking the oath.
      (3)   (a)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold at least one hearing
on the application and may hold as many hearings as necessary when the nature
of the application and the nature of any proposed evidence may require
additional hearings.
         (b)   All hearings shall be conducted to assure fundamental fairness
and a full opportunity by the applicant, objectors, and a reasonable number of
other interested citizens to participate fully in the hearing process,
including, but not limited to, the right to present witnesses on the applicable
standards in division (F) below and the opportunity to question any witness of
the other party. The Chairperson shall have the right to restrict repetitive
testimony. Any party appearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals may exercise
the right to transcribe or record the proceedings at the expense of the party.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall accommodate any request to transcribe or
record the proceedings.
      (4)   The Zoning Board of Appeals reserves the right to control the
location of recording devices to ensure the orderly nature of the proceedings.
The party exercising their right to transcribe or record the proceedings shall
have recording equipment and/or person(s) who will transcribe the proceedings
available at the commencement of the hearing. The failure of said party to
provide recording equipment and/or persons to transcribe said hearing shall not
be just cause to request continuance.
   (E)   Notice of hearing.
      (1)   Notice of time and place of such hearing shall be published not
less than 15 or more than 30 days preceding said hearing and at least once in
one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county.
      (2)   The Administrative Officer shall also cause service of written
notice not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the hearing in person or
by mail, upon the Township Supervisor and the County Board member representing
the township or district of the subject site, and to all property owners whose
property adjoins the subject site property lot lines, and to any other person
or entities required by law to be notified and to all persons or entities
entitled to object to such special uses.
      (3)   In the event that property adjoining the subject site is owned by
the applicant, notice will be sent to the owners of property which adjoin such
other property owned by the applicant, if such property is not more than 1,500
feet from the subject site property lot lines. The owners shall be identified
as those persons or entities which appear upon the authentic tax records of the
county in the County Supervisor of Assessment’s office as of January 1 of the
calendar year of the filing of the special use request.
      (4)   The calculations of the distance and the determination of adjoining
and adjacent property owners shall exclude all public roads, streets, alleys,
and other public ways.
      (5)   In computing distances, the Administrative Officer is entitled to
rely on the property records as such exist as of the date the applications is
filed. The written notice shall contain the date, time, and place of the
hearing, the name and address of the applicant, location of the proposed site,
the nature of the special use and a statement that persons have a right to
participate in the special use hearing. The notice to the Township Supervisor
and County Board Member, and adjacent and adjoining property owners, shall
include the above referenced information.
   (F)   Standards.
      (1)   No special use shall be granted by the County Board unless such
Board shall find:
         (a)   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort, or general welfare;
         (b)   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood,
and will be located and operated to minimize incompatibility with the character
of the surrounding area and to minimize the effect on the value of the
surrounding property. The applicant need not demonstrate complete
compatibility, but the applicant shall demonstrate reasonable efforts to
minimize incompatibility;
         (c)   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the districts;
         (d)   The adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or other
necessary facilities have been or are being provided;
         (e)   The adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets;
         (f)   The plan of operations for the special use is designed to
minimize the danger to the surrounding area from fire or other operational
accidents; and
         (g)   The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the County Board.
      (2)   (a)   After a special use permit has been granted, the

Meetings Act.

testimony presented by persons and parties, such as time limits and barring the

repetitious evidence shall not be admissible. The Chairperson shall rule on all
questions related to the determination of the qualification of a party as an
“interested party” (see division (D)(7) below) and admissibility of evidence,
which ruling may be overruled by a majority of the public body in attendance.
The Chairperson may impose reasonable conditions on the hearing process based
on the following factors:
         (a)   The complexity of the issue(s);

behalf or may be represented by an attorney.

wishing to appear as interested parties with the right of cross-examination
shall identify themselves as such by completing and filing an appearance with
the Zoning and Building office at the County Building no later than five
business days before the date of the meeting on appearance forms available from
the County Zoning Building office during regular business hours, and the
Chairperson shall determine if such persons are interested parties based on the
degree of impact the issue(s) has/have on such person. The Chairperson shall
qualify someone as an interested party based on the following guidelines,
although it is recognized that there may be other relevant factors considered
or that the public body may overrule the Chairperson by a majority vote of
those in attendance:

notice of the public hearing via the postal service;
         (b)   Persons who have a direct property or economic interest; and

interest in a subject issue such as a neighborhood association, environmental

relates to the subject of the public hearing.
      (8)   To avoid repetition, the Chairperson may require that people with a
similar interest in the proceeding select among themselves a spokesperson to
present their position.
      (9)   The Chairperson may determine the order of presentation of
evidence, which shall generally be as follows:
         (a)   Presentation by staff of its written report, if any, oral
presentation of additional or conflicting information, if any, and questions
from the public body of staff regarding said report and additional comments;

PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 154.485 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to
promote to the extent possible:
      (1)   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the
public by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the other sections of this chapter;
      (2)   A permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas
and facilities;
      (3)   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation,
topographic, and geologic features;
      (4)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
facilities that results in better development, design, and the construction of
aesthetic amenities;
      (5)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, and other facilities; and
      (6)   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
morals, and welfare.
   (B)   The PUD District is intended to provide for a development
incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and
developed as a unit but departs from the normal standards and requirements of
other sections of this chapter.
   (C)   (1)   The planned unit development may provide amenities not otherwise
required by law and may establish facilities and open space greater than the
minimums required by law.
      (2)   Such development may consist of conventionally subdivided lots or
provide for development by a land use and zoning plan which establishes the
location and extent of the features of the planned unit development in keeping
with the purpose of the plan.

any public improvement in the planned unit development shall be initiated only
after recording of the final PUD plan has been recorded with the County
Recorder, and shall be issued in full conformance with this chapter.
   (E)   Changes in the planned unit development. The planned unit development
shall be developed according to the approved and recorded final plan, recorded
approved plan, and supporting data together with all recorded amendments shall
be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees, and assigns, and
shall limit and control the use of premises and location of structures in the
planned unit development project as set forth therein.
      (1)   Major changes.
         (a)   A change in the approved preliminary PUD plan or final PUD plan
which alters the concept or intent of the planned unit development including a
change in usage, the configuration, increase in floor area or the height of
buildings, an increase in intensity, a reduction of proposed open space, a
change in road locations or standards, a change in the final governing
agreement, provisions, or covenants, or other major changes, shall be approved
only by submission of a new preliminary PUD plan in accordance with the
procedures as previously set forth for the approval of preliminary and final
PUD plans.

ILLUMINATIONS PROVISIONS
§ 154.570 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to establish lighting requirements for
personal safety and crime prevention while regulating any spill-over of light
and glare on operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses near a
light source to promote personal and traffic safety, and to prevent the
creation of public nuisances.
(Ord. passed 5-16-2023)
§ 154.571 LIGHTING PLAN.
   (A)   Except for single-family and two-family dwellings, plans for required
parking lot and security lighting shall be approved by appropriate officials
and the Police Department prior to approval and issuance of permits. Plans, at
appropriate scale, shall be based on accurate, approved final site plans and
shall depict all exterior lighting as to its location, orientation, and
configuration.
   (B)   This must include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Luminaire height;
      (2)   Luminaire and standard technical specifications;
      (3)   Intensity of illumination measured at the least point of
illumination and the greatest point of illumination when measured from ground
level;
      (4)   Type of light source (metal halide, high pressure sodium, and the
like);
      (5)   Hours of illumination; and
      (6)   Photometric plan superimposed on the site plan for each
classification of lighting with points no greater than 30 feet apart.
(Ord. passed 5-16-2023)
§ 154.572 ILLUMINATION PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Lighting standards in all zoning districts except those containing
single-family and two-family dwellings:
      (1)   Wall or roof lighting may be used to illuminate the pedestrian
walkways, entrance areas, and yard areas within 30 feet of the building. No
wall or roof lighting shall be used to illuminate areas for motor vehicle
parking or access unless the Police Department and the appropriate officials
find the following:
         (a)   The proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated purpose
in this section;
         (b)   The proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         (c)   The proposed luminaire has a cutoff angle of less than or equal
to 66 degrees.

shall be illuminated with freestanding luminaries. Freestanding luminaries are
permitted to be a maximum of 30 feet in height with a three-foot support, for a
maximum height from the ground of 33 feet. When a luminaire is located within
500 feet of a protected residential property, the maximum permitted luminaire
height shall be 25 feet. All measurements shall be taken from the average
elevation of the finished grade within ten feet of the structure or fixture to
the highest point of the luminaire. All luminaries must have a total cutoff
angle equal to or less than 90 degrees. The use of exterior lighting with a
cutoff angle greater than 90 degrees shall be permitted only when the Police
Department and appropriate official find the following:
         (a)   The lighting is not in conflict with the stated purpose in this
section;
         (b)   The proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         (c)   The proposed lighting will not result in an impairment of vision
creating a hazard for vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      (3)   In no instance shall low pressure sodium fixtures be used to
illuminate non-protected residential property unless the Police Department find
the following:
         (a)   The proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated purpose
in this section;
         (b)   The proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         (c)   The color distortion effect of low pressure sodium lighting will
not create a hindrance to crime prevention and investigation.
   (B)   Intensity of lighting in all zoning districts except those containing
single-family and two-family dwellings:
      (1)   The amount of illumination attributable to exterior lighting from a
property shall not exceed one foot-candle when measured at any boundary line
with an adjoining property. This provision may be waived by the issuing
authority when:
         (a)   The proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated purpose
of this section;
         (b)   The proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         (c)   The proposed lighting will not result in an impairment of vision
creating a hazard for vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      (2)   All parking lot and parking structure lighting located within 300
feet of a protected residential property line may be illuminated not more than
one hour before the start of business and shall be extinguished within one hour
after the end of business except as approved by the Police Department after
finding the following:
         (a)   The property has been identified as an area where the incidence
or potential for crime warrant additional lighting;
         (b)   Additional lighting is required to increase visibility of a
property which is not readily accessible for police during routine patrol; and
         (c)   The use of timers, sensors, or other devices that produce a
reduced lighting level that does not conflict with the stated purpose in this
section.
   (C)   (1)   In all zoning districts, any lighting shall be arranged to
reflect the light away from adjoining property.
      (2)   A person shall not conduct a use that has a source of illumination
that produces glare clearly visible beyond a property line or creates a
sensation of brightness within a visual field so as to cause annoyance,
discomfort, or impairment of vision.
      (3)   The use of lenses, deflectors, shields, louvers, or prismatic
control devices shall be used to eliminate nuisance and hazardous lighting to
facilitate compliance with this requirement.
   (D)   Luminaries used for illumination of designated pedestrian walkways in
parking structures shall be of a significantly different color value than
luminaries used for illuminating vehicle parking and drive aisles.
(Ord. passed 5-16-2023)
§ 154.573 COMPLIANCE.
   Any new lighting installed after the effective date of this chapter shall be
in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Any lighting in existence
before the effective date of this chapter that does not comply with its
requirements shall be considered legally non-complying and may remain, subject
to the following provisions:
   (A)   Alterations to existing lighting.
      (1)   When policies and support structures are removed and replaced for
reasons other than acts of God or accidents, they must be replaced with
luminaries, policies, and supports that comply with this section; and

of the parking area on a particular site is removed and replaced at one time,
the entire parking lot on the site where the construction activity occurs must
be in full compliance with this section.
      (2)   A parking lot or portion thereof is removed and replaced when any
portion of the existing parking surface material is removed and a new surface
is installed.
   (C)   New parking lots or parking lot additions. When a new parking lot or
addition to an existing parking lot is constructed, the new lot or lot addition
must be provided with lighting in compliance with this section.
   (D)   New structures, additions, or replacements. When a site is improved
with new structures, or additions to, or replacements of, existing structures,
the lighting for the new structure, addition, or replacement on the site must
be upgraded with complying lighting. The parking lot lighting must be upgraded
with complying lighting over a portion of the parking area that is equivalent
to the amount of parking that would be required for the new structure,
addition, or replacement. In the event that the new structure, addition, or
replacement is accompanied by new or replaced parking area, the amount of
upgraded lighting area shall be that required under this section.
   (E)   Change of type of occupancy. When the type of occupancy of a site is
changed, the lighting for the site shall be upgraded, to comply with this
section for the structure and the parking lot be upgraded for the required
parking for the occupancy as established in this code. For purpose of
determining the type of occupancy of a site, the occupancy classifications of
the county code shall be utilized.
   (F)   Unoccupied sites. When a site has been unoccupied for a period of one
year, the lighting shall be upgraded to fully comply with this section prior to
any reoccupation of the site.
   (G)   Development application. When a development application is made for a
site, the County Board may, as a condition of approval, require compliance with
any or all of the performance standards of this section and the extent of
compliance required in such cases may be greater than that otherwise required
in this section, if deemed reasonably necessary to protect the public health,
safety, or welfare and to achieve the proposes of this section.

§ 154.595 BUFFERYARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Intent. The provisions of this section are to provide specific
landscape screening and bufferyard requirements to reduce the incompatibility
between zoning districts of different intensity and type. These bufferyards
will lessen the adverse impact of more intense land uses upon residential areas
and/or other areas of less intense use by reducing noise, visual, and other
environmental impacts.
   (B)   Requirements.

street parking areas, bufferyard standards will also apply for site plans
requiring a zoning change, special use permit, and non-exempt site plan review
requirements.
      (2)   The bufferyard requirement is determined by the difference between
the zoning district of the subject property and the zoning district of adjacent
properties. The specific requirements are identified in the following sections
and the accompanying table in §
154.599. Landscaping and screening requirements for off-street parking areas
apply to the side of the property abutting a public street right-of-way. A list
of prohibited trees is provided in §

square feet in area.
      (2)   (a)   This agreement shall state that the enclosed area below FPE
shall not be converted for use other than for parking, building access or for
allowable storage as detailed in this subchapter and verified with annual
inspections.
         (b)   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement.
   (F)   Established procedures for administering and documenting
determinations, as outlined below, of substantial improvement and substantial
damage.
      (1)   Determine the market value or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser of
the building before the start of construction of the proposed work. In the case
of repair, the market value of the building shall be the market value before
the damage occurred and before any repairs are made.
      (2)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building.
      (3)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or substantial damage.
      (4)   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance
with the flood resistant construction requirements of this subchapter.
      (5)   A form shall be used to document the actual calculations for
projects and may be required to be recorded in the County Recorder office if
the improvements exceed 20%.

farmhouses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      (2)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community’s flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
      (3)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (for example,
foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, and the
like) below the base flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant
materials in accordance with §
154.615.
      (4)   (a)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with §
154.616.
         (b)   All of the building’s structural components must be capable of
resisting specific flood-related forces, including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.

§ 154.678 COUNTY RURAL LIVING CONTRACT.
ROCK ISLAND COUNTY
   RURAL LIVING CONTRACT
Introduction: Life in the rural areas of the County is different from life in the city. County
governments may not be able to provide the same level of service that city governments provide.
To that end, we are providing you with the following information to help you make an informed
decision before you purchase a parcel of land in rural Rock Island County.
1.   Agriculture: Some of the people who feed this nation (and the world) work right here in Rock
Island County. If you are going to move your family into their work area, it is important you
understand how their job, work environment, and hours of operation may affect you.
   -   Farmers often work around the clock, especially during planting and harvest time. It is
possible that adjoining agriculture uses from lighting and noise may disturb your peace and quiet
24 hours a day.
   -   Land preparation and other agricultural operations, as well as rural roads, cause dust,
especially during windy and dry weather.
   -   Farmers occasionally burn ditches and fields to keep them free of debris and weeds. This
is a normal part of a farming operation, and this may create objectionable smoke. During these
burns it may be necessary to stay inside or leave your residence for a short time if you have a
sensitivity to it.
   -   Chemicals (mainly fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides) are often used in agricultural
activities and may be applied via irrigation systems, ground vehicles or various aircraft. You
may be sensitive to these substances and some people may actually have allergic reactions. They
may “drift” causing damage to your landscaping. Make sure you leave enough of a buffer area from
YOUR property line to avoid damage. These are necessary tools for agricultural areas of our
County, and you must be aware of/prepared to deal with their application.
   -   Farm animals are raised in the country and they can generate odors that can be very strong
at times. They also make noise, draw insect populations, and sometimes get loose from their
pasture or holding areas. In the city, large numbers of animals near your residence would be a
nuisance, in the rural areas, your residence is the nuisance as large numbers of animals belong
here. If you build a home 15 ft. from your property line, the farmer has the right to place a
large number of cattle or hogs on his property. Please be aware that farmers are within their
rights, and you have accepted the consequences by choosing your proximity to the property line.
   -   Agriculture is an important part of the Rock Island County economy. If you choose to live
in the work area of farmers, you cannot expect County government to intervene in the normal day-
to-day operations of your agri-business neighbors. In fact, we are more likely to require you to
stay out of his or her way as this is their workplace and you have made the decision to build a
home in their work area.
   -   Farmers must move their equipment between fields. Every time you are running late, a large
piece of slow-moving farm equipment will be on the road in front of you. They may take up both
lanes so you cannot pass. Anticipate these delays and be patient, keeping their, your, and
other’s safety at the forefront.
   -   Farm animals can be dangerous and can attack humans. Children need to know that it may not
be safe to enter pens where farm animals are kept, even the little cute ones. It is your
responsibility to teach your children respect for livestock, property and property lines of your
neighboring farmer.
   -   Livestock animals being herded from one location to another have the right-of-way on
County roads and highways. You MUST yield to them even if it delays you.
   -   Insects may be more of a problem in the country than they are within city limits. Insects
feeding on actively growing crops or emerging from cropland can migrate to landscaping and
gardens adjacent to cropland. It will be your responsibility to control them if they become a
nuisance.
   -   Farm, hay, pasture and timber ground is not open for your use to hunt, ride ATV’s, etc.
unless you have requested and been given permission to do so by the owner or tenant. These areas
are also not to be used as dumping grounds.
2.   Access: The fact that you can drive to your property does not necessarily guarantee that you
have legal ingress/egress or that your guests and emergency service vehicles can achieve that
same level of access at all times. You cannot assume that you have an automatic easement across
someone else’s property to enter your property. Also consider:
   -   Emergency response times (sheriff, fire suppression, medical care, etc.) may be much
longer than in an incorporated city. Under some extreme conditions, you may find that emergency
response is extremely slow due to circumstances beyond their control. Some fire, ambulance and
search and rescue services in Rock Island County are volunteer and may provide limited services.
Check with the departments or organizations that provide these services if you are contemplating
residing in their jurisdictions.
   -   Rock Island County has its own road system to take care of, and there are also 18 Township
road districts totaling hundreds of miles of roads, ranging from paved to unimproved dirt roads.
There are also a number of roads that are Private Drives, and these may have a homeowners
association to whom you pay dues, which is responsible for the maintenance of roads, bridges,
plowing etc.
   -   Rock Island County can experience adverse weather conditions that may cause damage to
roads. It is wise to determine who is responsible for the maintenance of the roads providing
access to your property.
   -   Many large construction vehicles and some fire and rescue vehicles cannot navigate small,
narrow roads. If you plan to build, it is prudent to check out construction and emergency vehicle
access. Remember, it may be more expensive to build a rural residence due to delivery fees and
the time required for building materials to reach your site.
   -   School buses travel only on maintained public roads that have been designated as school
bus routes by the local school district (some subdivision roads are private). In order for your
child or children to get to school, you may be responsible to drive your children to the nearest
County road or designated school bus route. Please check with the appropriate school district for
school locations and routes.
   -   In extreme weather, even the best County maintained roads could become impassable. You may
miss work or appointments.
   -   Dust, again, is an unpleasant fact of life for most rural residents. If your road is
unpaved, it is unlikely that any one of the 19 highway districts will pave it in the foreseeable
future. Remember that unpaved roads are not always smooth and you may experience increased
vehicle maintenance costs when regularly traveling on rural County roads.
   -   Mail delivery may not always be available to some rural areas of the County. Ask the
postmaster to describe the system for your area. This may also apply to package delivery services
as well.
3.   Services: Water, sewer, electric, fire, telephone and other services may be unavailable or
have more frequent interruptions. Repairs may take longer due to their rural nature. Cellular
communications may be a problem in some areas of Rock Island County.
   -   Sewer service is not available to sites located outside city limits. You will need to use
an approved subsurface sewage (septic) system or other treatment process. The type of soil, depth
to groundwater or bedrock, slope, etc. will be very important in determining the cost and
function of your subsurface sewage system. Ask for assistance from the Rock Island County Health
Department (309-794-7061) for information on how to get a system approved or inspected.
   -   Most unincorporated areas do not have access to a water supply for domestic use, so you
will need to locate an alternate supply. The most common method is use of a well. The cost for
drilling and pumping may be considerable and the quality and quantity of water (also known as the
yield) can vary considerably from location to location and seasonally.
   -   It is important to determine the proximity of electric power because it can be expensive
to extend power lines to very remote areas. In addition, if you have special power requirements,
it is important to know what level of service can be provided to your property. Natural gas may
not be available and propane is more expensive.
   -   Power outages can occur in outlying areas with a greater frequency than in cities. A loss
of electrical power can also interrupt a private water supply from a well. Extended power outages
may also cause a loss of food in freezers or refrigerators and power outages may cause problems
with computers. It may be important to be able to survive temporarily in severe weather with no
utilities if you live in the country.
   -   Trash removal may be more expensive in rural areas. It is illegal to create your own trash
dump, even on your own property. Know the cost for trash removal prior to making the decision to
move into the country. In some cases, the only option may be to haul your trash to a local
landfill (state and County law prohibits burning of domestic trash in a burn barrel). Recycling
services may not be available in rural areas.
4.   Your property: There are many issues that can affect your property. It is important to
research them before purchasing land in rural areas of the County. Easements may require you to
allow the construction of roads, power lines, water lines, sewer lines, etc. across your land.
There may be easements that have not been recorded by the County or as part of the original
property. Check these issues carefully.
   -   You may be provided with a map of your property, but unless the land has been surveyed and
pins placed by a licensed surveyor, you should not assume that the map is accurate.
   -   Fences that separate properties are sometimes misaligned with the actual property lines. A
survey of the land by a licensed surveyor is the only way to confirm the location of property
lines. Illinois law can require you to pay for half of your agricultural neighbors fence if it
needs repaired or replaced. (Illinois law says you may be responsible for the right half of the
fence line as you are facing it from your property.)
   -   Before you purchase that home with the beautifully manicured 5 acre yard, (or 10 acres or
2 acres) you should consider the effort required to maintain it. A large yard requires a lot of
time and work, and if you decide to split your acreage to make the yard smaller, the County may
not allow it. (There are areas where 40 acres is the smallest lot size allowed, and parcels of
five acres or less cannot have grass higher than 12 inches.)
   -   The surrounding properties may not remain as they are indefinitely. If you are moving to
the country on a small piece of ground, anticipate that others will do the same thing, even right
next to your property. Also, be aware that vacant ground or crop ground may have cattle or hogs
on it next year.
   -   Flowing water can be a hazard, especially to young children. Before you decide to locate
your home near an active ditch, canal or other water conveyance, consider the possible danger to
your family and your responsibility to take safety measures.
   -   If you are purchasing a parcel close to a city or within a city area of impact (1.5 miles
from the city border), annexation in the future is a possibility. If you live near a school,
future development is likely, and will be encouraged by the County.
5.   Mother Nature: Residents of the County may experience more problems when the elements and
earth turn unfriendly. Here are some thoughts for you to consider:
   -   Black ice or icy conditions on rural roadways is always a probability.
   -   The topography of the land can give you an indication of where the water will flow during
large precipitation events. When property owners fill in natural drainages, they may cause the
water that once drained naturally to drain through unwanted areas potentially causing property
damage to you or your neighbor’s property.
   -   Floodplains have been designated by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) within the
County. Portions of the County require special building considerations if located within the
floodplains. It is advisable to consult Rock Island County Zoning & Building Office before buying
or building.
   -   Nature can provide you with some wonderful neighbors. However, even harmless wildlife can
cross the road unexpectedly and cause traffic accidents. Rural development encroaches on the
traditional habitat of animals that may be dangerous. In general, it is best to enjoy wildlife
from a distance. It is important that you handle your pets and trash properly so that they will
not create problems for you and/or the wildlife.
In Conclusion: Rock Island County is a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family. This
contract is designed to provide information that will help enhance the quality of life here.
Respect your agri-neighbor’s livelihood and property, and be aware that your actions may impact
your neighbors, human and otherwise. While the information presented here is intended as a
guideline and an introduction into some of the realities of rural living, you may discover other
issues that have not been covered by this document. We encourage you to research and examine all
aspects of country living prior to moving to a rural setting so you will enjoy the country and
not have any unpleasant surprises.
Rock Island County elected officials, administration and staff pride themselves on their
accessibility. By participating in the publication of the Rural Living Contract, Rock Island
County is in no way divesting itself of its responsibility to its constituents, rather, is
attempting to make clear to constituents what those responsibilities are. We offer this
publication in the sincere hope that it will help you better understand how things work in Rock
Island County.

evidence. No ruling of the hearing officer shall be appealable to the PCF
Committee or the County Board.
   (E)   The applicant for site location approval shall have the burden of
going forward with evidence of the suitability of the site location for the
proposed use. The request for site location approval previously filed, and all
reports, maps, or studies contained therein shall be deemed evidence and
admitted as an exhibit at the public hearing.
   (F)   Any person appearing at such public hearing shall have the right to
give testimony and comment on the suitability of the site location for the
proposed use. All persons intending to participate in the hearing, including
members of the public, must submit written notification of said intent to the
County Clerk before the first day of public hearing or register in person with
the hearing officer prior to the close or adjournment of the first day of
hearing. Any person who has submitted a timely notification of intent to
participate at such public hearing shall have the right to present testimony
and witnesses and orally comment on the suitability of the site location for
the proposed use. Any such person shall have the right to be represented by an
attorney at said public hearing. Participants represented by attorneys shall
have the right of reasonable cross-examination, subject to the hearing officers
judgment and consistent with fundamental fairness. Participants not represented
by attorneys shall be allowed to submit written cross-examination questions to
the hearing officer, who shall exercise discretion to direct relevant and non-
duplicative cross-questions to the applicable witness. Cross-questioning of
witnesses will be permitted only during that period immediately following each
witness' testimony.
   (G)   Conduct of the public hearing shall be substantially as follows:
      (1)   Call to order;
      (2)   Introduction of the hearing officer;
      (3)   Recognition of the applicant and identification of the request for
site approval;
      (4)   Recognition by the applicant of fees, notices, and date of filing
of the request for site approval;
      (5)   (a)   Recognition of the PCF Committee and other parties wishing to
testify and any other reports, exhibits, maps, or documents of record as filed
pursuant to this chapter, as amended. All parties, including members of the
public, intending to testify or cross-examine must sign in or submit written
notification of said intent to the County Clerk or hearing officer on or before
the first day of the public hearing. Should the public hearing extend beyond
one day, additional parties or members of the public, not of record as of the
first day of the public hearing, will not be allowed to present testimony or
cross-examine, except as authorized by the hearing officer for cause shown,
consistent with fundamental fairness; and
         (b)   Subject to §
156.06(D), any person wishing to comment orally, without being subject to
cross-examination, may do so at the conclusion of evidence, subject to the
hearing officer's discretion;
      (6)   The applicant, the county, and other parties represented by counsel
may make an opening statement;
      (7)   Testimony from the applicant and/or any witnesses the applicant may
wish to call. Upon the close of the applicant's evidence, the county and other
parties may offer expert witnesses and other testimony or evidence they may
wish to present. Members of the public, of record, as set forth in divisions
(F) and (G)(5) above, may then present oral comment. All members of the public
who participate by providing oral comments shall do so under oath. The hearing
officer shall decide the order of presentation of testimony subject to this
subchapter;
      (8)   All witnesses shall testily under oath. Testimony may include the
use of exhibits. All witnesses shall be subject to reasonable questioning as
follows: direct, cross-questioning, redirect, recross, and the like. After all
parties have presented testimony, reasonable rebuttal, surrebuttal, and the
like, may be allowed at the discretion of the hearing officer;
      (9)   Should any issues, facts, data, or other evidence arise during the
course of the public hearing, which were not apparent or reasonably foreseeable
from the request for site approval as filed with the County Clerk, such
situation may constitute grounds for a recess in the public hearing for a
period not to exceed five working days;
      (10)   Summary statements by the applicant, other parties, and the
county, subject to limitations as imposed by the hearing officer;
      (11)   Rebuttal statement, if any, by the applicant, subject to
limitations as imposed by the hearing officer;
      (12)   Proposed findings of fact and recommendation of the parties. Prior
to the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall fix a date after the
hearing to file the same with the County Clerk; and
      (13)   Hearing closed.
   (H)   If, prior to making a final local siting decision, the County Board
has negotiated and entered into a host agreement with the applicant, the terms
and conditions of the host agreement, whether oral or written, shall be
disclosed and made a part of the hearing record for that local siting
proceeding. In the case of an oral agreement, the disclosure shall be made in
the form of a written summary jointly prepared and submitted by the County
Board and the applicant, and shall describe the terms and conditions of the
oral agreement.
(Ord. 2024-10-A, passed 11-19-2024)
§ 156.06 PUBLIC COMMENT.
   (A)   The County Clerk shall receive written comment from any person

written comment the County Clerk shall date stamp the same and shall file the
written comment and the postmarked envelope in which the comment is received as
part of the record in the siting proceeding.
   (B)   Copies of such written comments shall be made available for public
inspection in the office of the County Clerk. Members of the public shall be
allowed to obtain a copy of any written comment received by the County Clerk
upon payment of actual cost of reproduction.
   (C)   Any written comment received by the County Clerk or postmarked not
later than 30 days after the date of the last public hearing shall be made part

determination concerning said request. In the event that the thirtieth day
falls on a Sunday or a federal holiday, the next day on which mail is delivered
shall be considered the thirtieth day for purposes of this division (C).
   (D)   All public comment, oral or written, which is timely submitted, shall
be considered by the County Board. Public comments may not be entitled to the
same weight as testimony which is provided under oath and subject to cross-
examination; while public comment shall be considered, it may be entitled to
lesser weight.
(Ord. 2024-10-A, passed 11-19-2024)

(Ord. 2024-10-A, passed 11-19-2024)
§ 156.08 SITE APPROVAL DESIGN.
   (A)   After the public hearing and any continuation thereof, the PCF
Committee shall hold a meeting for purposes of developing a written
recommendation and proposed decision to the County Board on the request for
site location approval. If findings of fact are made, such findings shall be
supported by the record. The written recommendation and proposed decision of
the PCF Committee shall be delivered to the County Board for consideration by
the County Board in making its decision on the request for site location
approval.
   (B)   The County Board's decision on the request for site location approval
shall be based on the following criteria:
      (1)   The facility is necessary to accommodate the waste needs of the
area it is intended to serve;
      (2)   The facility is so designed, located, and proposed to be operated
so that the public health, safety, and welfare will be protected;
      (3)   The facility is located so as to minimize incompatibility with the
character of the surrounding area and to minimize the effect on the value of
the surrounding property; and
      (4)   (a)   For a facility other than a sanitary landfill or waste
disposal site, the facility is located outside the boundary of the 100-year
floodplain, or the site is flood-proofed;
         (b)   For a facility that is a sanitary landfill or waste disposal
site, the facility is located outside the boundary of the 100-year floodplain,
or if the facility is a facility described in 415 ILCS 5/22.19a(b), the site is
flood-proofed;
      (5)   The plan of operations for the facility is designed to minimize the
danger to the surrounding area from fire, spills, or other operational
accidents;
      (6)   The traffic patterns to or from the facility are so designed as to
minimize the impact on existing traffic flows;
      (7)   If the facility will be treating, storing, or disposing of
hazardous waste, an emergency response plan exists for the facility which
includes notification, containment, and evacuation procedures to be used in
case of an accidental release;
      (8)   If the County Board has developed a solid waste management plan
consistent with the planning requirements of the Local Solid Waste Disposal Act
or the Solid Waste Planning and Recycling Act, the facility is consistent with
said plan; for purposes of this criterion, the SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN
means the County Solid Waste Management Plan; and
      (9)   If the facility will be located within a regulated recharge area,
any and all applicable requirements specified by the IPCB for such area have
been met.
   (C)   The County Board may consider as evidence the previous operating
experience and past record of convictions or admissions of violations of the
applicant (and any subsidiary and parent corporation) in the field of solid
waste management when considering divisions (B)(2) and (B)(5) above.
   (D)   Pursuant to 415 ILCS 5/39.2(a), local siting approval shall be granted
only if the proposed facility meets the criteria cited above.
   (E)   (1)   The County Board shall make a final written decision within 180
days from the date of filing of the site approval request, specifying the
reasons for the decision, which reasons shall be in conformance with 415 ILCS
5/39.2(a).
      (2)   The County Board may conditionally approve of any request for site
approval, provided such conditions are not inconsistent with regulations
promulgated by the IPCB.
      (3)   Any determination by the County Board shall be supported by the
record, which record shall be made available for review by all members of the
County Board.
   (F)   No written determination by the County Board of a site approval
request may be reconsidered.
(Ord. 2024-10-A, passed 11-19-2024)
§ 156.09 EX-PARTE COMMUNICATIONS PROHIBITED.
   In recognition of the quasi-judicial role of each member of the County Board
and the state's attorney, ex-parte communications with persons other than
members of the County Board or the state's attorney concerning the request for
site approval are prohibited between the date of filing of the request for site
approval and the date of the final decision of the County Board (or the one
hundred eightieth day after said date of filing). Although the members of the
County Board are encouraged not to attend meetings at which the member knows
the request for site approval may be discussed, it is inevitable that due to
their regular legislative duties over the course of time during the
consideration of the request for site approval they may be in attendance at
such meetings (for example, attendance at a municipality's council of
governments meeting, attendance at a local chamber of commerce meeting, and the
like). As such, the member is required to obtain and file a transcript of any
meeting, where such meeting has been transcribed or recorded, or otherwise
disclose such meeting in the public records (such as disclosing it on the
record during the transcribed public hearings or during the written comment
period provided for in §
156.06). The transcript shall not, however, be utilized by the county in
reaching its decision.
(Ord. 2024-10-A, passed 11-19-2024) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.10 ADMINISTRATION OF FEES AND COST; FILING DEPOSIT.
   (A)   (1)   All expenses incurred by the county in conducting the review of
the request for site approval, conducting the public hearing, making the site
approval decision, and responding to any appeal thereof by a person other than
the applicant shall be paid by the applicant, including the costs of any
consultants, attorneys, or hearing officer utilized by the county in connection
with the request for site approval, costs of court reporting, and transcripts
for the public hearing, and witness fees. Said expenses shall be paid from the
application fee.
      (2)   The county shall periodically submit a detailed accounting and
summary of all expenditures and reimbursements, authorized pursuant to division
(A)(1) above, to the applicant for payment.
   (B)   (1)   Each applicant for siting approval of a pollution control
facility in the county must, at the time of filing the application for site
approval, pursuant to 415 ILCS 5/39.2, deposit with the County Board a filing
fee deposit of $75,000. If the proposed facility is intended to be a hazardous
waste disposal site, the filing fee deposit shall be $125,000.
      (2)   Pursuant to the provisions of 415 ILCS 5/39.2(e) and (k), in the
event an applicant files an amended application in the manner allowed by law,
such shall be accompanied by an additional filing fee in the amount of $25,000.
      (3)   The applicable filing fee is intended to defray the reasonable and
necessary costs of processing the application, including, but not limited to,
cost of site inspection, clerical expenses, copying costs, space rental,
hearing officer compensation, court reporter expenses, transcription costs,
staff review expenses, special prosecutor expenses, and consulting fees, such
as charges by engineers, planners, appraisers, and environmental counsel.
      (4)   In the event there are funds remaining in the filing fee deposit
after payment of the county's costs and expenses, such shall be refunded to the
applicant without interest, upon final resolution of the application process,
including any and all types of administrative or judicial review.
      (5)   In the event the county incurred additional costs in excess of the
filing fee deposited, the applicant will be responsible therefor, and shall
promptly pay over such amounts to the county upon request or demand.
      (6)   Upon receipt any and all fees required by the provisions of this
chapter shall be deposited in a special account in the County Treasury to be
paid out by the County Treasurer upon order of the County Board. Such fees
shall not be expended for any purpose not authorized by this chapter.
(Ord. 2024-10-A, passed 11-19-2024)
§ 156.99 PENALTY.
   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no specific
penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
