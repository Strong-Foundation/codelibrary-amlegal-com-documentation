any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued, or
claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any
such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or

and not a new enactment of the same provisions; nor shall this chapter be
deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued or

force at the time of the adoption of this Code.
(1980 Code § 75-21; amd. 2019 Code)

An administrative hearing shall be held to adjudicate City Code violations on
their merits in accordance with the following provisions:
   A.   Time, Date And Location: The time, date, and location of any
administrative hearing shall be as set forth on a violation notice.
   B.   Recording: Administrative hearings shall be tape-recorded.
   C.   Nonappearance: Persons who do not appear on their scheduled hearing
date shall have a determination of liability entered against them by default. A
determination of liability entered by default shall be forwarded to any person
who fails to appear and shall contain the same information as a determination
of liability. The default determination of liability may be set aside by the
Hearing Officer if, within twenty one (21) days of issuance of the
determination, a petition is received stating what the Hearing Officer
determines is good cause for failure to appear or at any time if the petitioner
establishes the City did not provide proper service of process of the violation
notice. The Hearing Officer shall provide the petitioner with notice of a new
hearing date or his/her denial of the petition. The default determination shall
state that it shall constitute a determination of liability if such petition is
not received, if the petition is denied, or if, after setting of a new hearing
date, the person fails to appear.
   D.   Hearing Rights: Persons appearing to contest an alleged ordinance
violation may be represented by counsel of their own choice at their own
expense, may present witnesses, may present testimony and documents, may cross-
examine opposing witnesses, and may request the issuance of subpoenas to compel
the appearance of relevant witnesses or the production of relevant documents.
Subpoenas shall be certified by the Administrator and shall be served and
include a witness fee in the same manner and rate as applicable to Circuit
Court subpoenas.
   E.   Evidentiary Standard: The formal and technical rules of evidence do not
apply. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted if it is of the type
commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their
affairs. City police reports, inspection reports, and records of State and
other governmental agencies shall be admissible in evidence.
   F.   Determinations: Hearings shall result in a final determination of
liability or nonliability after consideration of the facts and/or testimony.
The Hearing Officer shall, upon a determination of liability, assess fines,
penalties, and costs in accordance with this article. A determination shall
constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial review.
   G.   Notice Of Determination: A notice of determination shall be sent
following the conclusion of the administrative hearing and shall contain, at a
minimum, the following information:
      1.   The determination, including the findings, decision and order of the
Hearing Officer;
      2.   A statement of any fines, penalties and costs imposed;
      3.   A date by which the violation must be brought into compliance with
this Code;
      4.   A statement that any unpaid fines and penalty constitute a debt due
and owed to the City; and
      5.   A warning that the determination of the Hearing Officer may be
enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction. In the case in which a defendant fails to comply with a judgment
ordering the correction of a City Code violation or imposing any fine or other
sanction as a result of the City Code violation, a statement that any expenses
incurred by the City to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to,
attorney fees, court costs and costs related to property demolition or
foreclosure, shall be a debt due and owed to the City and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law.
(Ord. 2479, 8-22-2017)
1-4A-7: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW:
Administrative review of final determinations issued by the Hearing Officer
shall be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law as is set
forth in 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq. The City shall have the
right to appeal a determination, regardless of whether the citation in question
was formally prosecuted with the presence of an attorney representing the City.
(Ord. 2479, 8-22-2017)
1-4A-8: ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT:
   A.   Collection: Upon exhaustion or expiration of the period in which
judicial review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought,
unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or costs
imposed that remain unpaid shall constitute a debt due and owed to the City and
may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
   B.   Judgment: Upon exhaustion or expiration of the period in which judicial
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought, unless
stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, a determination of liability may
be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction. In any case in which the Hearing Officer finds that a defendant
failed to comply with a determination ordering the defendant to correct an
ordinance violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of an
ordinance violation, any expenses incurred by the City to enforce the judgment,
including, but not limited to, attorney fees, court costs, and costs related to
property demolition or foreclosure after they are fixed by the Hearing Officer,
shall be a debt due and owed to the City and may be collected in accordance
with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a Hearing Officer
hereunder, the Administrator shall provide notice to the defendant that
provides that the defendant shall appear at a hearing before the Hearing
Officer to determine whether the defendant has failed to comply with the
judgment. The notice shall set the date for such hearing, which shall not be
less than seven (7) days from the date that notice is served. If notice is
served by mail, the seven-day period shall begin to run on the date that the
notice was deposited in the mail.
   C.   Lien: A determination of liability may be enforced in the same manner
as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, including the
recording of a memorandum of judgment or other instrument in the manner
authorized by article XII of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS art. XII) or
by the Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.), and upon recording,
the judgment shall constitute a lien on the real estate or personal estate, or
both, of the defendant in the amount of any debt due and owed to the City.
(Ord. 2479, 8-22-2017)
1-4A-9: NONEXCLUSIVE ENFORCEMENT:
The City reserves the right to employ all other means and methods available
under the law to enforce this City Code, including direct application to the
courts.

The fines and penalties assessed for Code violations administered through the
administrative adjudication system shall be as provided in this Code.

contractors to properly and efficiently respond to the call.
(Ord. 2569, 4-28-2020)

of the time and place of the bid opening.
(Ord. 2569, 4-28-2020)
3-2A-6: RESERVATIONS:
A call to bidders shall not create any legal obligation on behalf of the City

offer to contract with the City if awarded the same. The security shall be made
payable to the City, without condition, in an amount of not less than ten
percent (10%) of the aggregate bid amount. Any contractor who shall fail to

3-2A-8: NON-RESPONSIVE BIDS:

(Ord. 2569, 4-28-2020)
3-2A-9: EVALUATION FACTORS:
Bid evaluation guidelines may be included in the contract documents available
to a contractor to bid on a particular project. In the absence of specific bid
evaluation guidelines, the following shall apply:
   A.   All bids deemed responsive, or otherwise accepted for evaluation, shall
be evaluated and ranked according to the qualifications of the contractor,
financial stability, ability commence and complete the project in an
expeditious manner, and bid amount. The contractor most qualified for the
project will receive the highest ranking in that category and the contractor
submitting the lowest bid will receive the highest ranking in that category.
   B.   The City Engineer will examine and investigate the contractor’s past
performance history, expertise, capabilities, governmental standing with the
jurisdiction authority over any part of the project, financial resources,
employment, equipment and material availability, and outstanding projects that
may affect a contractor’s workmanship or ability to start or complete the
project in a timely manner. Any and all references listed by a contractor may
be contacted by the City. Material omissions or falsification of information
requested from the contractor will result in a disqualification from the
project and may disqualify a contractor from bidding on future projects.
   C.   Uncharacteristically low or high bids shall be examined for mistakes or
the contractor’s misunderstanding of the scope of the project. A contractor
submitting an uncharacteristically low or high bid may be contacted by the City
Engineer and questioned regarding the accuracy of the same. Neither the bid
amount nor the scope of the project may be altered in consequence of such an
inquiry, except to the extent an easily identifiable typographical or
mathematical error can be objectively implemented in such a manner that does
not affect the integrity of the bidding process. Negotiations are strictly
prohibited. Bids that are uncharacteristically low or high due to mistakes that
cannot be corrected will be rejected.
   D.   The aggregate bid score of all bids shall be transcribed in a bid
abstract. The bid abstract, score calculation sheets, information generated as
a part of the evaluation, and the recommendation of the City Engineer shall be
forwarded to the City Council for review and action.
   E.   Bid scores may be adjusted by the City Council upon review of the City
Engineer’s recommendation and evaluation records. Bid scores shall be adopted
by the City Council as presented or modified.
   F.   The bid receiving the highest aggregate bid score by the City Council
shall be considered the lowest responsible bidder, and may be awarded the
contract for the project, subject to the provision and execution of necessary
documents.
   G.   The City Engineer shall notify all contractors of the result of the bid
evaluation and award. All contractors except the two receiving the highest
aggregate bid score shall be relieved of any further responsibility for the
project, and any bid security submitted to honor the same shall be released.
(Ord. 2569, 4-28-2020)
3-2A-10: WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS:
Bids may be withdrawn prior to the expiration of the bidding period, but any
such withdrawal shall disqualify the contractor from the project. No bid shall
be withdrawn after the bid opening until the earlier of the consent of the City
or forty-five (45) days following the expiration of the bidding period, as may
be extended.
(Ord. 2569, 4-28-2020)
3-2A-11: EXECUTION OF CONTRACT DOCUMENTS:
The contractor determined to be the lowest responsible bidder shall execute and
deliver all contract documents no later than next regular City Council meeting
following the award, or fifteen (15) days after the award, whichever is last to
occur. Upon execution of the contract, the bid bond of the contractor awarded
the contract, and the contractor having the next highest aggregate bid score,
shall be released. In the event the lowest responsible bidder fails to execute
and deliver all contract documents in the time and manner prescribed, the City
may, but shall not be required to, award the contract to the next lowest
responsible bidder. If the City decides not to award the contract to the next
lowest responsible bidder, the bid security of the contractor that failed to
execute and deliver the contract documents will be forfeited in full.
(Ord. 2569, 4-28-2020)
3-2A-12: CHANGE ORDERS:
Any contract procured through competitive bidding that authorizes or
necessitates any increase in the contract price that is 50% or more than the
original contract price, then the portion of the contract that is covered by
the change order shall be resubmitted for bidding in the same manner as the
original contract.
(Ord. 2569, 4-28-2020)
3-2A-13: STATE AND FEDERAL PROCUREMENT STANDARDS:
Nothing herein shall absolve the City from complying with such conditions as
may be imposed by the State of Illinois or the United States of America, or
their agencies, departments or officials, when the contract to be awarded by
the City is funded in whole or in part with state or federal monies, as the
case may be.

invoice, and (iii) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges
on the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If
the nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from

payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to
collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to

that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall

subsection to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the
municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.

by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this State and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be collected

owed by the retailer to the State. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege or
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this article shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the
manner provided by the Department.

charge for telecommunications.

this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall clarify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

side of railroad tracks because the railroad crossings are obstructed by trains
or railroad cars, that on said occasions, all railroad crossings on the
railroad track have been blocked and obstructed, making it impossible for an
ambulance, emergency vehicle, fire truck or police vehicle promptly to pass
from one side of the tracks in the City to the other to attend emergencies,
that on various occasions railroad employees have failed or refused to
cooperate when such an emergency has existed, and that irreparable injury,
mischief and damage has and will occur on account of said obstructions.

   C.   Implementation and Procedure: The mitigation rates above are flat fees,
except for itemized responses, and have been determined to be usual, customary
and reasonable for the incident responses listed. The mitigation rates were
determined by itemizing costs for a typical incident (from the time a fire/EMS
apparatus leaves the station until it returns to the station) and are based on
the actual costs, using amortized schedules for apparatus (including useful
life, equipment, repairs, and maintenance) and labor rates (based upon an
average department's “actual personnel expense,” and not just a firefighter's/
EMT's base wage). The actual personnel expense includes, but not by way of
limitation, costs such as wages, retirement benefits, workers' compensation,
and insurance. When a claim is submitted, it will be itemized and based on the
actual services provided in accordance with the above rates.
      The mitigation rates shall represent an additional cost of the claim for
damages of the vehicles, property and/or injuries, and may be filed with the
insurance carrier of the owner of the titled vehicle, owner of the property, or
the responsible party or parties. In other circumstances, the owner of the
titled vehicle, owner of the property, or the responsible party or parties will
be billed directly.
      Annually, on December 1 of each calendar year, the mitigation rates set
forth above shall be increased by the greater of 2.60% or the previous year's
rate of inflation, calculated based on the Consumer Price Index - Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W, Chicago All Items) published by the United
States Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 365-day period ending on the most
recent October 1.
      Responses involving intoxicated drivers, hazmat clean-up, intentional or
negligent acts, or any act that violates any local, State or Federal law or
regulation, may be subject to all applicable mitigation rates.
   D.   Collection: The City shall cause a bill to be issued to the person or
entity (resident or nonresident) who utilizes or is serviced with the emergency
services. Interest shall accumulate and be due upon such fee at the rate of one
percent (1 %) per month commencing as of the thirtieth (30th) day following the
mailing of the bill. All fees collected in conformance with this section shall
be deposited in the General Fund of the City and used for providing funds to
the Fire Department of the City for future replacement of life-safety vehicles
or equipment as may be determined by the City Council of the City.

   A.   Refusal To Issue Or Renew:
      1.   Grounds: The Building Official may refuse to issue or renew a crime-
free residential rental license, in whole or in part, for past violations of
this chapter, violations of the Property Maintenance Code, refusal to take
steps to mitigate against or prevent future violations of this chapter or the
Property Maintenance Code, failure to complete any requirements of a
conditional license, threats to the health, safety and welfare of the tenants/
occupants/public, if the landlord has had his/her crime-free residential rental
license denied, suspended or revoked in the past by the City or other
municipality operating under similar regulations and cannot show that the
circumstances attending such action have been remedied or that steps have been
taken to prevent future violations of a similar nature, and the falsification
of information or documents required to be submitted under this chapter.
      2.   Determination By Building Official:
         a.   The Building Official shall make his determination in writing
which shall include the factual basis and legal conclusion for his

renewal is submitted or within three (3) business days of a landlord or rental
manager’s failure to timely complete any requirements of a conditional license.

(i.e., for all dwelling units proposed to be governed by a particular license),
depending on the circumstances. A determination not to issue or renew a crime-
free residential rental license in whole shall be supported by a finding that
the prior violations were systematic, the result of wilful actions or
omissions, on-going despite warnings or requests for compliance by the Building
Official, or otherwise constitute a universal threat to the health, safety and
welfare of the tenants governed by the license.
      3.   Conditional License In Lieu: In lieu of refusing to issue or renew a
crime-free residential rental license, the Building Official may issue a
determination that a conditional crime-free residential rental license is
appropriate under the circumstances. A conditional crime-free residential
license shall be valid for a limited time period during which the landlord
shall be required to undertake and/or satisfy certain measures identified by
the Building Official before a crime-free residential rental license is issued
or renewed. The conditions imposed shall be directed towards remedying past
violations, the prevention of future violations under this chapter, or as a
probationary technique to ensure the landlord or rental manager understands and
has taken measures to ensure compliance with this chapter. A crime-free
residential rental license shall not be issued if the landlord fails to
complete or violates the conditions listed in the Building Official’s
determination in the time period referenced.
      4.   Appeals: A landlord may appeal the Building Official’s decision not
to issue or renew a crime- free residential rental license as provided in
subsection B of this section.
      5.   Effect Of Determination: The Building Official’s decision shall be
final and take immediate effect fourteen (14) days after it is issued, assuming
no appeal is taken.
   B.   Appeals:
      1.   The Building Official’s decision to not issue or renew a crime-free
residential rental license may be appealed by the landlord to the Mayor of the
City. The landlord shall perfect the appeal by filing exceptions with the City
Clerk no later than fourteen (14) days after the date of the Building
Official’s determination. The exceptions shall identify any factual or legal
errors with the Building Official’s determination, a short argument in favor of
reversal, and a copy of the Building Official’s determination. Any argument or
basis for reversal not raised in the exceptions shall be deemed waived on
appeal.
      2.   The timely filing of exceptions shall stay the Building Official's
determination through the date on which the appeal is decided.
      3.   Within forty eight (48) hours of the filing of exceptions, the Mayor
of the City shall send written notice of the appeal to the Building Official
and the landlord. The notice shall include a copy of exceptions as well as
notification as to the date, time and location for the hearing on the appeal.
Notice shall be provided by certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, to
the home addresses listed for the landlord.
      4.   Licensees shall be permitted but are not required to be represented
by an attorney. The Building Official may be represented by an attorney. The
City Attorney shall sit as counsel for the Mayor.
      5.   A de novo hearing shall take place no sooner than twenty five (25)
days nor more than forty five (45) days after exceptions are filed with the
City Clerk. The Mayor shall preside over the hearing and base his/her decision
upon the evidence submitted. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the
hearing. All witnesses proposed to testify shall be presented live, sworn in,
and subject to direct and cross-examination. The landlord shall have the burden
of proof and shall be required to prove its case by a preponderance of
evidence.

shown on the tax rolls of Iroquois County, and/or the occupant, at the address
of the property, if these persons are different than the person in charge, and
shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage pre- paid.
      4.   A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after ten
(10) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the person
in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the Chief of Police.
      5.   The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may be
a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
proceedings under this chapter.
      6.   If, after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal
proceedings by the City pursuant to this chapter, a person in charge stipulates
with the Chief of Police that the person in charge will pursue a course of
action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the
violation, the Chief of Police may agree to postpone legal proceedings for a
period of not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days, except in the
case of a nuisance activity under this chapter where a search warrant was
executed at the property. If the agreed course of action does not result in the
abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is
reached within thirty (30) days, the Chief of Police shall instruct the City
Attorney to commence legal proceedings to abate the nuisance.
      7.   Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the
Chief of Police shall send copies of the notice, as well as any other
documentation which supports legal proceedings, to the City Attorney.
   C.   When a person in charge makes a response to the Chief of Police as
required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with the
furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance
activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not, however, require
the exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered for any
other purpose.
(2019 Code)
6-9-4: REMEDIES:
   A.   In the event a court determines a property to be a chronic nuisance
property, the court may order that the property be closed and secured against
all use and occupancy for a period of not less than thirty (30) days, but not
more than one hundred eighty (180) days, or the court may employ any other
remedy deemed by it to be appropriate to abate the nuisance and to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City.
   B.   In addition to the remedy provided in subsection A of this section, the
court may impose upon the owner of the property a civil penalty as set forth in
section
1-4-1 of this Code, for each day the owner had actual knowledge that the
property was a chronic nuisance property and permitted the property to remain a
chronic nuisance property.
   C.   In determining what remedy or remedies shall be employed, the court may
consider evidence of other conduct which has occurred on the property,
including, but not limited to:
      1.   The disturbance of neighbors.
      2.   The recurrence of loud and obnoxious noises.
      3.   Repeated consumption of alcohol in public.
(2019 Code)
6-9-5: ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE; BURDEN OF PROOF:
   A.   The City Attorney of the City of Watseka or the State’s Attorney of
Iroquois County, upon request of the Mayor, may commence an action to abate a
chronic nuisance, as defined herein. Upon being satisfied by affidavits or
other competent sworn evidence that a chronic nuisance exists, the court may,
without notice or bond, enter a temporary restraining order or a preliminary
injunction to enjoin any defendant from maintaining such nuisance and may enter
an order restraining any defendant from removing or interfering with all
property used in connection with the chronic nuisance.
   B.   In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, the City
shall have the initial burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   C.   It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a chronic nuisance
property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in
the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had
become a chronic nuisance property, or could not, despite the exercise of
reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that
the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   D.   In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court
may consider any of the following factors:
      1.   The action or lack of action taken by the person in charge to
mitigate or correct the problem at the property.
      2.   Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous.
      3.   The magnitude or gravity of the problem.
      4.   The cooperation of the person in charge with the City.
      5.   The cost to the City investigating and correcting or attempting to
correct the condition.
      6.   Any other factors which the court, in the interests of preserving
and protecting the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
City, deems reasonably appropriate.
(2019 Code)
6-9-6: EMERGENCY CLOSING PROCEDURES:
   A.   In the event the Chief of Police determines the property is an
immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare, the City may apply
to the court for such interim relief as is deemed by the Chief of Police to be
appropriate. In such event, there need not be compliance with the notification
provision set forth in section
6-9-3 of this chapter; however, the City shall make a diligent effort to notify
the person in charge prior to a court hearing.
   B.   In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a CHRONIC
NUISANCE PROPERTY, as defined in this chapter, the court may order the remedy
set out above. In addition, in the event that it finds the person in charge had
knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting or violating
this chapter and permitted the activities to occur, the court may assess a
civil fine as provided above.
   C.   The court may authorize the City to physically secure the property
against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time
specified by the court. In the event that the City is authorized to secure the
property, all costs reasonably incurred by the City to effect a closure shall
be made and assessed against the owner, and shall further constitute a lien
against the property. As used herein, "costs" means those costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorney fees, actually incurred by the City for the
physical securing of the property, as well as tenant relocation costs.
   D.   The City shall prepare a statement of costs and shall thereafter submit
the statement to the court for its review. If no objection to the statement is
made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be
recorded against the property.
   E.   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by
the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof by the City.
   F.   A tenant is entitled to its reasonable relocation costs, as determined
by the court, if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into the property
after either:
      1.   The owner received notice as described herein of the Police Chief's
determination as described above.
      2.   Unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought
pursuant to this section.

sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation,
excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (3) taken as a
whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
   B.   Elements Of The Offense: A person commits obscenity when, with
knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he or she:

circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      2.   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance.

be admissible to show:
         a.   The character of the audience for which the material was designed
or to which it was directed.

adults or a special audience, and what effect if any, it would probably have on

of the material, or absence thereof.
         d.   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in the

advertising or other promotion of the material.

special justification for possession of such material.

8-12-2, he shall cause the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle to a facility
controlled by the City or its agents. No vehicle shall be seized and impounded
under this section unless the police officer determines that such action is
necessary and reasonable under the circumstances including, but not limited to,
community caretaking functions. If the vehicle is capable of being removed from
the scene by an individual who is present on the scene (not otherwise to be
taken into custody), and who has permission from the owner of the vehicle to
drive the vehicle, and the individual is otherwise capable of lawfully
operating a motor vehicle in the State of Illinois, the police officer shall
allow that individual to remove the vehicle without the same being subject to
seizure and impoundment. Similarly, if the vehicle is parked legally, and/or
will not present a hazard to the public safety or otherwise jeopardize the
efficient movement of vehicular traffic at its location, the officer shall
permit the vehicle to remain at its location without being seized and impounded
pursuant to this subsection. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to prevent a
police officer from seizing and impounding a vehicle when necessary for
investigative purposes or when otherwise authorized pursuant to some other
lawful purpose.
(Ord. 2580, 7-28-2020)
8-12-4: BOND:
Any vehicle seized and impounded under Section

the administrative hearing. If a cash bond in the amount of Five Hundred
Dollars ($500.00) is posted with the City, the impounded vehicle will be
released to the owner, upon the payment by the owner of the towing and storage
costs. If a penalty is imposed for a violation of this Section
8-12-2, the cash bond will be forfeited to the City to satisfy such penalty;
provided, in the event that a violation of Section
8-12-2 is not proven, the bond will be returned to the owner. Any form of bond
posted pursuant to this section will be held by the City until the hearing
officer issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until a reviewing
court issues a final decision. No bond shall be required to be posted in the
event a vehicle is not seized and impounded.
(Ord. 2580, 7-28-2020)
8-12-5: PRELIMINARY HEARING ON IMPOUNDMENT:
Whenever a vehicle is seized and impounded, the police officer shall notify the
person identifying himself or herself as the owner of the vehicle, or any
person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged
violation, of the vehicle owner’s right to request a preliminary hearing within
twelve (12) hours of the seizure. If the owner of a vehicle seized under the
provisions of this section timely requests a preliminary hearing, the Watch
Commander or any supervising officer must conduct a preliminary hearing within
twenty-four (24) hours after the request for the preliminary hearing is
received by the ‘City; provided that if the date for the hearing falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the preliminary hearing will be held on the
next business day following the Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. No
preliminary hearing shall be required or granted to an owner whose vehicle was
not seized and impounded. For purposes of this section, the following shall
apply:
   A.   All interested persons will be given a reasonable opportunity to he
heard at the preliminary hearing.
   B.   The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay
testimony will be allowed, and will be admissible.
   C.   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the Watch Commander or
supervising officer determines that there was probable cause to believe that
the vehicle was being used in violation of Section
8-12-2, and further determines that the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle
was proper under Section
8-12-3, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle unless the
owner of the vehicle posts a cash bond with the City in the amount of Five
Hundred Dollars ($500.00). Posting of the bond shall not relieve the owner from
paying any applicable towing and storage costs associated with the seizure and
impoundment of the vehicle.
   D.   If the Watch Commander or supervising officer determines that there was
no probable cause to believe that the vehicle was used in violation of Section
8-12-2, or otherwise determines that the vehicle should not have been seized
and impounded pursuant to Section
8-12-3, the motor vehicle will be returned to the owner of record without the
posting of the bond and without the costs associated with the seizure and
impoundment of the vehicle. A determination that the vehicle should not have
been seized and impounded pursuant to Section
8-12-3 has no bearing nor will relieve an owner of responsibility for violating
Section
8-12-2.
(Ord. 2580, 7-28-2020)
8-12-6: FINAL HEARING:
   A.   Notice of Hearing. Any owner issued a citation for a violation of

impoundment of the vehicle was proper under the circumstances. The application
for a hearing shall be made no later than five (5) days after notice has been
given either personally or by certified mail, whichever is applicable in the
given circumstance. The application to request a hearing shall be provided by
the City at the time notice is given. The bond will be forfeited in the event a
hearing is not requested as provided for in this chapter.

owners hearing:
      1.   Unless continued by order of the hearing officer, the hearing shall
be held within forty five (45) days the citation was issued.

heard at the final hearing.
      3.   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer
determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in
violation of Section

8-12-3, the hearing officer shall order the continued impoundment of the
vehicle until the owner of the vehicle pays to the City a penalty in the amount
of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), plus the towing arid storage costs. In the
event the vehicle was not impounded, an order shall be entered wherein the

officer shall enter an order of default in favor of the City, which order shall
require the payment to the City of a penalty of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).
      5.   If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was not used as
hereinabove provided in violation of Section
8-12-2, the motor vehicle will be returned to the owner of record of the
vehicle without any penalty or other costs, or, if a cash bond had previously
been posted, the cash bond shall be returned.
      6.   If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was used in
violation of Section
8-12-2, but determines that the vehicle was not properly subject to seizure and
impoundment under Section
8-12-3, the hearing officer shall enter a judgment against the owner in the
amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and release the seized vehicle without
towing and storage costs and/or order the reimbursement of towing and storage
costs if the vehicle was previously released.
      7.   The ticket issued shall constitute prima facie evidence that the
offense stated was committed.
      8.   Any penalty assessed shall be a debt due and owing the City.

review is filed with a court of proper jurisdiction. Where a petition for
judicial review of the hearing officer’s determination is filed and pending in
a court of proper jurisdiction, the vehicle shall not be deemed to be abandoned
and shall lot be sold. If the petition for judicial review is resolved in favor
of the City, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of by
the City if the penalty and towing and storage costs are not paid within thirty
(30) days after the date of the Court’s order.
(Ord. 2580, 7-28-2020)

9-4-1: PURPOSE; SCOPE; INTERPRETATION:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities in the rights-of-way within the City so
as to:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
City’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the City's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   B.   Scope: This chapter applies to all facilities on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way within the City, unless
otherwise exempted pursuant to a franchise, license, or similar agreement.
   C.   Franchises, Licenses Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   The City may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license,
or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over,
above, along, upon, under, across, or within a right-of- way. Utilities or
wireless providers that are not required by law to enter into such an agreement
may request that the City enter into such an agreement.
      2.   In the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider
has a franchise, license, or similar agreement with the City, such franchise,
license, or similar agreement shall govern and control during its term.
      3.   In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the
provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any franchise, license, or
similar agreement between the City and any telecommunications provider, the
provisions of such franchise, license, or similar agreement shall govern and
control during the term.
      4.   Existing agreements between the City and wireless providers that
relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way,
including the collocation of small wireless facilities on City utility poles,
that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small wireless
facilities collocated on the City's utility poles pursuant to applications
submitted to the City before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination
provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall
comply with this chapter. A wireless provider that has an existing agreement
with the City on the effective date of the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment
Act, P.A. 100-0585, may accept the rates, fees and terms that the City has
currently adopted for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the
installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless
facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two (2) or more
years after the effective date of the act by notifying the City that it opts to
accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement remains in effect,
subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities
the wireless provider has collocated on the City's utility poles pursuant to
applications submitted to the City before the wireless provider provides such
notice and exercises its option under this subsection C4.
   D.   Sound Engineering Judgment: The City shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter, and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements provided herein when appropriate under the
circumstances.

includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the City fails to approve or
deny the application within ninety (90) days after the submission of a
completed application. However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the
City in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner
than seventy (75) days after the submission of a completed application. The
permit shall be deemed approved on the later of the ninetieth day after
submission of the complete application or the tenth day after the receipt of
the deemed approved notice by the City. The receipt of the deemed approved
notice shall not preclude the City's denial of the permit request within the
time limits as provide under this section.
         e.   An application to collocate a wireless facility that does not
meet the definition of a "small wireless facility" under this chapter and seeks
installation on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be
approved or denied by the City within ninety (90) days.
         f.   An application to collocate a wireless facility that does not
meet the definition of a "small wireless facility" under this chapter and
requires construction of a new wireless support structure or pole shall be
approved or denied by the City within one hundred fifty (150) days.
         g.   The City shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this chapter. If the City determines that applicable codes,
ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or any of the
requirements of this chapter, require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider. The City shall document the basis for a
denial, including the specific code provisions or application conditions on
which the denial is based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or
before the day the City denies an application.
         h.   An applicant whose application has been denied may cure the
deficiencies identified by the City and resubmit the revised application once
within thirty (30) days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without
paying an additional application fee. The City shall approve or deny the
revised application within thirty (30) days after the applicant resubmits the
application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised
application within thirty (30) days of denial shall require the applicant to
submit a new application with applicable fees, and result in recommencement of
the City's review period. Any review of a revised application shall be limited
to the deficiencies cited in the denial, except in cases in which the revised
application involves review of a new location, new or different structure to be
collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.
         i.   Upon approval of an application to collocate a small wireless
facility on a Municipal utility pole, the City and the applicant shall enter
into a Master Pole Attachment Agreement, provided by the City, for the initial
collocation. For subsequent approved permits to collocate a small wireless
facility on a Municipal utility pole, the City and the applicant shall enter
into a License Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment Agreement.
         j.   The time period for filing small wireless facility applications
may be further tolled by: 1) an express written agreement by both the applicant
and the City; or 2) a local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
(Ord. 2529, 12-18-2018)
   D.   Supplemental Review:
      1.   Telecommunications Retailers:
         a.   Pursuant to section 4 of the Telephone Company Act (220 ILCS 65/
4), a telecommunications retailer shall notify the City that it intends to
commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the City not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Public Works Director shall
specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed,
used and constructed.
         b.   In the event that the Public Works Director fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: 1)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the City by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction; or
2) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter.
         c.   Where a permit is required for work pursuant to this chapter, the
telecommunications retailer shall submit to the City an application for a
permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of subsection D1a of this section.
      2.   Holders Of State Authorization Under The Cable And Video Competition
Law Of 2007: Applications by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 (220 ILCS 5/21-
100 et seq.) shall be deemed granted forty five (45) days after submission to
the City, unless otherwise acted upon by the City, provided the holder has
complied with applicable City codes, ordinances, and regulations.
   E.   Effect Of Permit:
      1.   Authority Granted: A permit authorizes a permittee to undertake
certain activities in the right- of-way and does not create a property right or
grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may
have an interest in the right-of-way.
      2.   Term Of Permits:
         a.   Utilities: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for
a period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually commenced
and prosecuted diligently thereafter to completion.
         b.   Small Wireless Facilities: For permits issued to wireless
providers to collocate small wireless facilities, the collocation must be
complete within one hundred eighty (180) days after the issuance of the permit,
unless the City and the wireless provider agree to extend the period or a delay
is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of
the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time
to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after
issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the City
grants an extension in writing to the applicant. Small wireless facility
permits which comply with the foregoing shall be for a period of not less than
five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless
the City makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or
modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable City codes or any
provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter.
      3.   Pre-Construction Meeting Required: No construction shall commence
prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and
subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction
meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place
designated by the City with such City representatives in attendance as deemed
necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the
permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work
will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other
facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of
other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and
access and egress by adjacent property owners.
      4.   Compliance With Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the City
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other laws that may govern
the construction.
      5.   Location Revisions: In the event that the actual location of any
facilities deviates in any material respect from the location identified in the
plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the
permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the City no later
than ninety (90) days after the permittee has knowledge of the same. The
revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the location of the
actual facilities deviates from the locations approved in the permit. If any
deviation from the permit involves other deviations from the requirements of
this chapter, such submission shall be treated as a request for variance in
accordance with section
9-4-16 of this chapter. If the City denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
   F.   Suspension Or Revocation Of Permit:
      1.   Grounds: The City may revoke or suspend a permit for one or more of
the following reasons:
         a.   Fraudulent, false, misrepresented, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
         b.   Noncompliance with this chapter;
         c.   The permittee’s physical presence or presence of the permittee’s
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or
welfare; or
         d.   The permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially
in accordance with the permit and approved plans.
      2.   Notice Requirements: The City shall send written notice of its
intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this chapter stating
the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the alternatives
available to the permittee under this section.
      3.   Option Of Permittee:
         a.   Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the City, the permittee shall have the following options:
            (1)   Immediately provide the City with evidence that no cause
exists for the revocation or suspension;
            (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the City, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the City within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
            (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-
of-way to the satisfaction of the City, providing written proof of such removal
to the City within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
         b.   The City may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the
time period to complete any action required herein.
      4.   Stop Work Order: In addition to the issuance of a notice of
revocation or suspension, the City may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons that constitute a basis for the revocation or
suspension of a permit.
      5.   Failure Or Refusal Of Permittee To Comply: If the permittee fails to
comply with the provisions of subsection F3 of this section, the City or its
designee may, at the option of the City: a) correct the deficiencies; b) upon
not less than twenty (20) days’ notice to the permittee, remove the subject
facilities or equipment; or c) after not less than thirty (30) days’ notice to
the permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and
property of the City. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the City
for all costs of removal.
(Ord. 2516, 7-24-2018)
9-4-5: INSURANCE; INDEMNITY; SECURITY:
   A.   Insurance:
      1.   Coverages And Limits:

in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies:
               (A)   Commercial general liability insurance, including
premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly
referred to as “X”, “C”, and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations
coverage with limits not less than
                  i)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury
or death to each person;
                  ii)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property
damage resulting from any one accident; and
                  iii)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other
types of liability;
               (B)   Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired
vehicles with a combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00)
for personal injury and property damage for each accident;
               (C)   Workers’ compensation with statutory limits; and
               (D)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less
than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
            (2)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this subsection.
         b.   Wireless Providers: Wireless providers collocating small wireless
facilities shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and expense, the
following insurance:
            (1)   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost
against all risks;
            (2)   Workers’ compensation insurance, as required by law; or
            (3)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the City's right-of- way to afford minimum protection limits in
the same manner as described in subsection A1a(1)(A) of this section.
      2.   Additional Insured: The City, its officials, employees, and agents
shall be named as additional insureds on the policies identified in subsections
A1a(1)(A), A1a(1)(B) and A1a(1)(C) of this section.
      3.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this
subsection may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies.
Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying
insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the
primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or
umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.
      4.   Copies Required: The utility or wireless provider shall provide
copies of any of the policies required by this subsection to the City within
ten (10) days following receipt of a written request therefor from the City.
      5.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages:
         a.   The insurance policies required by this subsection shall contain
the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the Public Works Director of such intent to cancel
or not to renew.
         b.   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the City of the notice, and
in no event later than ten (10) days prior to the cancellation, the utility or
wireless provider shall obtain and furnish to the City evidence of replacement
insurance policies meeting the requirements of this subsection.
      6.   Self-Insurance: A utility or wireless provider may self-insure all
or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by
subsection A1 of this section. A utility or wireless provider that self-insures
is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the
requirement for the naming of additional insureds, or the requirements of
subsections A3, A4 and A5 of this section. A utility or wireless provider that
elects to self-insure shall provide to the City evidence sufficient to
demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and
limit requirements required under this subsection, such as evidence that the
utility is a “private self- insurer” under the Workers’ Compensation Act (820
ILCS 305/1 et seq.)
      7.   Effect Of Insurance Or Self-Insurance On Facility Liability: The
legal liability of the utility or wireless provider to the City and any person
for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-
insurance shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or
by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
      8.   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this
subsection shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by
insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of
Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-”
or better and of a class size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.
   B.   Indemnification: As a condition of any permit, and the right to occupy,
construct, or operate facilities in the right-of-way, a utility or wireless
provider shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the City and
its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents, and
representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from, or alleged
to arise out of or result from, the negligent, careless or wrongful acts,
omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility, wireless provider or
their affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in
the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility's
or wireless provider's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out
of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by
the City, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.
   C.   Security:
      1.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in the form
and amount specified herein. The security fund shall be continuously maintained
at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work
authorized by a permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:
         a.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
         b.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
         c.   The payment by the permittee of all liens and all damages,
claims, costs, or expenses that the City may pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee in violation of this chapter
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration
work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the City must
perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s
failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the City from the
permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
      2.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the City in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the City, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the City. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant
to this subsection C2 shall, at a minimum:
         a.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
City and the permittee;
         b.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection
by the City of any amounts covered by it; and
         c.   Shall provide a location convenient to the City and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
      3.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient
to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the City engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the City estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the City, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities
in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the City engineer may, in the
exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the
permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal
to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of
this subsection C3 for any single phase.
      4.   Withdrawals: The City, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under, this subsection C4, may withdraw an amount from the security
fund; provided, that the permittee has not reimbursed the City for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
         a.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
         b.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due
and unpaid;
         c.   Fails to reimburse the City for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the City has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
         d.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the City
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
      5.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the City that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C3 of this section.
      6.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the
City, upon written request for said withdrawal to the City; provided, that any
such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in subsection C3 of this section.
      7.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the City for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the City as a result of the revocation; provided,
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
      8.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the City with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to the security fund shall affect
any other right the City may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed upon or otherwise violated.
(Ord. 2516, 7-24-2018)
9-4-6: COLLOCATION OF SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES:
   A.   Permitted Use: Collocation of small wireless facilities on City utility
poles in the rights-of-way is a permitted use as long as such facilities meet
the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The City may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the City’s electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the City reasonably determines
that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
   C.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in a safe condition,
in good repair and in compliance with all requirements of this chapter. The
wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contractors that
perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately
trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental
standards and regulations.
   D.   Make-Ready Requirements:
      1.   Nonaerial Facility Poles: The City may require make-ready work on an
existing utility pole to ensure structural integrity, compliance with an
approved City plan, or to comply with any ordinance, law or regulation. The
City will not require more make-ready work than required to meet applicable
codes or industry standards. Make-ready work may include work needed to
accommodate additional public safety communications needs that are identified
in a documented and approved plan for the deployment of public safety equipment
as specified and included in an existing or preliminary City or public service
agency plan. Fees for make-ready work, including a City utility pole
attachment, shall not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to
communications service providers for similar work, and shall not include any
consultant fees or expenses for City utility poles that do not support aerial
facilities used to provide communications services or electric service. Make-
ready work, including any pole replacement, shall be completed within sixty
(60) days of written acceptance of the good-faith estimate by the City at the
wireless provider's sole cost and expense.
      2.   Utility Poles With Aerial Facilities: For City utility poles that
support aerial facilities used to provide communications services or electric
services, a wireless provider shall comply with the process for make-ready work
under 47 USC 224 and its implementing regulations. Wireless providers shall
follow a substantially similar process for such make-ready work except to the
extent that the timing requirements are otherwise addressed by this chapter.
The good-faith estimate of the person owning or controlling the City’s utility
pole for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the
requested collocation shall include City utility pole replacement, if
necessary. Make-ready work for utility poles that support aerial facilities
used to provide communications services or electric services may include
reasonable consultant fees and expenses.
   E.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency's communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will
be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the
FCC’s regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. If a small
wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been
given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the
wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference
with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970
through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The City may
terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if
the wireless provider is not in compliance with the FCC's public safety
spectrum rules. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall
constitute a public nuisance.
   F.   Electric Distribution Or Transmission System Poles: The wireless
provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on City utility poles
that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the
communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the
pole. However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the City utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. For
purposes of this subsection, the terms “communications space”, “communication
worker safety zone”, and “electric supply zone” have the meanings given to
those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   G.   Compliance With Applicable Codes And Design Standards: The wireless
provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or
regulations that concern public safety. The wireless provider shall comply with
written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility
poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are
set forth in any City ordinance, written policy adopted by the City, a
comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers
of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic
district.
   H.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this section, a wireless
provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any
specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to
collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with
respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility
associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that the small
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant. If the applicant refuses a collocation
proposed by the City, the applicant shall provide written certification
describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the
alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this subsection.
   I.   Height Limitations:
      1.   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support structure on
which the small wireless facility is collocated. New or replacement utility
poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are
collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') above the tallest existing utility pole, other
than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on
the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located within three
hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support
structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional
boundary of the City, provided the City may designate which intersecting right-
of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed utility pole or
wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such
facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      2.   If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in
excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility has
proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variance in
conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in section
9-4-16 of this chapter.
   J.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the City and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to
utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right- of-way.
(Ord. 2516, 7-24-2018)
9-4-7: CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP, IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS:
   A.   Notification Of Change: A utility or wireless provider shall notify the
City no less than thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any

      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk, and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway

as required by chapter 6 of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices. Where practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between
the roadway and the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be
allowed to remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width
does not allow for windrowing excavated material off the paved portion of the
roadway, excavated material shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         c.   The utility or wireless provider shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the City to be preserved.
      3.   Backfilling:
         a.   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction”. When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         b.   For a period of three (3) years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility or wireless provider shall be responsible to
remove and restore any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of
the facility. If so ordered by the City engineer, the utility or wireless
provider, at its expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to
the top of the installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill
material, and restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the
proper grades, as determined by the City engineer.
      4.   Pavement Cuts: Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair

         d.   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven (7) years, or resurfaced in the last
three (3) years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to
be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before
the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
JULIE locate.
      5.   Encasement:
         a.   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
City.
         b.   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (1') of the right-of-way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be located
in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of the
highway.
         c.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or City approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the City. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less,
encasement may be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated only
if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair;
and 2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         f.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

to any other permit required under this chapter.
         b.   Application For Permit: Applications for tree trimming permits
shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent workers
with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning practices. Tree
trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring
that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The City will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The City may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The City may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special

may eliminate aboveground utility poles as long as such decision is made on a
nondiscriminatory basis. In the event the City chooses to eliminate a utility
pole upon which a small wireless facility is collocated, the City will either:
1) install and maintain a reasonable alternative utility pole or wireless
support structure for the collocation of the small wireless facility; or 2)
offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a reasonable cost;
or 3) allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole so it can
maintain service from that location.
   E.   Abandonment Of Facilities:
      1.   Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the City,
the utility or wireless provider shall notify the City within ninety (90) days.
Following receipt of such notice, the City may direct the utility or wireless
provider to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Public Works
Director determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the City does not direct
the utility or wireless provider that abandoned the facility to remove it, by
giving notice of abandonment to the City, the abandoning utility or wireless
provider shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any

right-of-way, the utility or wireless provider shall take immediate steps to
provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on
the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If
a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is
such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair
operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the
shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of
access to the facility is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility or wireless provider shall, as soon as
possible, notify the Public Works Director or his or her duly authorized agent
of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for
protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with
the free movement of traffic, the City police shall be notified immediately.

means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.

way within forty eight (48) hours after an emergency repair.

request shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is
requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.

whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified
in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions:
      1.   The Public Works Director may authorize a variance only if the
utility or wireless provider requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
         a.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility or
wireless provider (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line)
create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision
unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
         b.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
      2.   As a condition for authorizing a variance, the Public Works Director
may require the utility or wireless provider requesting the variance to meet
reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained
within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of this chapter.
   D.   Right To Appeal: Any utility or wireless provider aggrieved by any
order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance,

Council. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City
Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement,
decision or determination. The City Council shall consider the appeal at its

continue shall constitute a new and separate offense. Additionally, there may
be times when the City will incur delay or other costs, including third party
claims, because the utility or wireless provider will not or cannot perform its
duties. Unless the utility or wireless provider shows that another allocation
of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility or
wireless provider shall bear the City’s costs of damages and its costs of
installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that
is the subject of the permit.
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional
or further remedies that the City may have for enforcement of this chapter.

responsibility for the cost of maintenance of lots acquired as a part of the
project, limit the potential for additional losses to property due to flooding,

lots into beautified gardens, recreational areas, and other approved open

   A.   The City is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR
403.5(c).
   B.   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in
excess of the daily maximum limit.
Local Limits On Toxic Pollutants
Pollutant Concentration (mg/L)
Pollutant     Concentration (mg/L)
Arsenic       1.0
Cadmium       0.05
Chromium      6.9
Chromium (VI) 0.05
Copper        1.8

   C.   Local limit guidelines are used as benchmarks for nonresidential users
because the treatment of such pollutants is a loading issue rather than a
toxicity issue. Guidelines are not legally enforceable and are not subject to
escalated enforcement. Should a nonresidential user continually exceed the
listed guideline values, it must either pay for increased capacity provided if
the additional loading is not causing an impact to the City’s POTW, or it may
be required to be classified within the City’s pretreatment program with the
guideline concentrations or alternatives incorporated into a wastewater
discharge permit as limits if an impact to the POTW has occurred. At the point
of incorporation into a permit, the guideline discharge concentrations become
enforceable as local limits.
Local Limit Guidelines On Nontoxic Pollutants
 
Pollutant        Concentration (mg/L)
Ammonia-nitrogen 25
Phosphorus       10

after the publication of proposed pretreatment standards under section 307(c)
of the Clean Water Act which will be applicable to such source if such
standards are thereafter promulgated in accordance with that section; provided,
that one of the following is true:
      1.   The building, structure, facility, or installation is constructed at
a site on which no other source is located;
      2.   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces
the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at
an existing source; or
      3.   The production or wastewater-generating processes of the building,
structure, facility, or installations are substantially independent of an
existing source at the site. In determining whether these are substantially
independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility is integrated
with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in
the same general type of activity as the existing source, should be considered.
   B.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results
in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create
a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of
subsection A2 or A3 of this definition, but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds
to existing process or production equipment.

equipment; or
         b.   Significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation,
or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary
for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or
equipment; or
      2.   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of
facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a
reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or
modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering,
and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation under this
subsection C2.
   D.   New sources shall install and have in operating condition and shall
"start up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable
pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest
feasible time (not to exceed 90 days), new sources shall meet all applicable
standards.

   D.   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in subsection B of this
definition has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's
operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the City
may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received
from a user, determine that such user should not be considered a significant
industrial user.

sewer blockage being experienced by a residential customer, the customer must
first contact City Hall and request that a representative of the City Public
Works Department visit the residence of the customer.
      2.   The representative shall then make a determination as to whether the
cause of such sewer blockage is within the City's portion of the sewer system
or within the customer's portion of the sewer system.
      3.   If such representative determines that the cause of the sewer
blockage is not within the City’s portion of the sewer system, then the
customer shall pay all costs and expenses associated with the repair or
replacement of the customer's portion of the sewer system.
      4.   If such representative cannot determine whether the cause of the
sewer blockage is within the City’s portion of the sewer system or within the
customer’s portion of the sewer system, then the City shall reimburse the
customer for a sum not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) incurred by the
customer in retaining the services of a licensed plumber to determine the cause
of the sewer blockage, who shall proceed in the following manner:
         a.   The licensed plumber shall enter upon the customer's property and
make reasonable efforts to rod the customer's sewer line. If he determines
after rodding the sewer line that the cause of the sewer blockage is within the

any event, the City shall not be required to extend the sewer tap for a
distance of more than sixty feet (60'). The property owner making the new
connection shall furnish and pay for all materials used in making the
connection, and the actual physical connection to the City sewer system shall
then be made by City sewer employees and approved by the City engineer.
      3.   Connection fees involving extra strength wastewater are as follows:
         a.   All nonresidential users are required to provide information to
the Pretreatment Coordinator on proposed discharges which may include
concentrations and flow rates of wastewater discharged to the POTW. For
wastewater that contains higher concentrations of PE-determining constituents
than residential wastewater, the fees shall be based as follows:
            (1)   The new sewer tap fee for nonresidential users, published in
the schedule of fees in section
10-2-2 of this title, shall be calculated on the basis of the impact on a
treatment works as the equivalent of the highest PE of the following
parameters: flow, BOD5, ammonia, or TSS. Any increase in PE will be added to
the baseline PE of the property for the purpose of establishing the connection
fee.
            (2)   In the event that the wastewater exhibits a ratio of COD to
BOD5 that is greater than three to one (3:1), the BOD5/PE will be calculated on
the basis of 0.33 of the COD value.
         b.   When the volume and strength of the wastewater to be discharged
to the public sewer is not known at the time of the connection, the fee shall
be estimated and adjusted to reflect actual conditions during the billing
period after a full year of operation.
         c.   The volume and strength of the wastewater, for fee purposes,
shall be based on the maximum workday discharge of constituents.
         d.   When a connection is made based on the applicant’s statement that
the strength of the wastewater does not exceed residential wastewater in any
constituent, and at the end of the billing period after a full year of
operation it is determined that the wastewater does exceed residential
wastewater in strength, the Pretreatment Coordinator may accept or reject the
wastewater and back- charge the user for fees plus penalties for the extra
strength wastewater or have the service disconnected.
         e.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may review the nonresidential user's
flow and loadings on an intermittent frequency, to identify increases to the
baseline PE. The City shall bill a connection fee to the nonresidential user
for increases to the baseline PE. Upon payment of the fee, the current site
baseline PE shall be adjusted to the newly established site baseline PE.
      4.   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building; except, that where one building stands at the rear of another
on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to
the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the
building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and
the whole considered as one building sewer and may be done only with the
written authorization of the Superintendent of the Sewer Department.
      5.   An existing building sewer may be used in connection with a new
building only when it is found, on examination and test by the City engineer or
Superintendent of the Sewer Department or the designee of the Superintendent of
the Sewer Department, to meet all requirements of this section and article C of
this chapter. All costs and expenses for this examination shall be paid by the
applicant.
      6.   Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet (10')
of a water service pipe shall be laid in a separate trench and at such an
elevation that the top of the sewer is at least eighteen inches (18") below the
bottom of the water service pipe. If it is impossible to obtain a horizontal
separation of at least ten feet (10') and a vertical separation of at least
eighteen inches (18"), as stipulated above, the sewer shall be constructed of
mechanical or slip-on rubber gasketed joint water main quality pipe and shall
be pressure tested to assure watertightness.
      7.   No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet
(3') of any bearing wall. No building sewer shall be installed in any place
where it may be subject to freezing temperatures unless adequate provisions are
made to protect it from frost. Changes in direction shall be made only with

allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The manhole
shall be installed and maintained by the owner and/or user at its sole cost and
expense and shall be safe and accessible to the authorized agents of the City
at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are not representative of its discharge.
         b.   Where such a sampling manhole location would be impractical or
cause extreme hardship on the user, the City may permit the sampling manhole to
be constructed in the public right-of-way, provided the sampling manhole is
located so that it shall not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
If a sampling manhole is located in a parking lot, a permanent barricade, such
as a vertical pipe, shall be placed around the sampling manhole to prevent
vehicles from driving or parking over the sampling manhole cover.
         c.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may postpone the installation of the
sampling manhole when specific circumstances (e.g., weather) prevent the
installation of a manhole.
         d.   When a postponement for a sampling manhole installation is
granted by the Pretreatment Coordinator, an affidavit shall be signed by the
property owner indicating that the sampling manhole shall be installed at a
later date should business practices change at the location. The affidavit for
sampling manhole installation postponement may be recorded by the City against
the property.
         e.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may determine sub-classes of
business that do not require the installation of a sampling manhole; provided,
however, sampling manholes shall be required in zoned business or industrial
parks.
   B.   Liquid Quantity Measurements:
      1.   All significant industrial users and users subjected to wastewater
surcharges may be required to install an open channel flow measuring device in
said sampling manhole. When required, the sampling chamber shall contain a
Palmer-Bowlus or Parshall flume or equivalent, unless a weir or similar device
is approved by the City.
      2.   The City may, at its option, based on the water usage and/or waste
loadings, require the user to install a device with a recording and totalizing
register for measurement of the liquid quantity. The device shall include a
recorder suitable to display seven (7) calendar days of flow at a time. The
equipment required to indicate, record and totalize the flow shall be located
in a warm, dry location and be accessible to the City for reading. This
equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at the user's sole cost
and expense. The user shall complete installation of the flume and secondary
flow measuring device based on the installation schedule approved for such
device by the City.
      3.   The user shall be required to calibrate and maintain the flow
metering equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended procedures
and frequencies. Users who operate flow measuring devices shall submit the
procedure for operation and maintenance (O&M) to the Pretreatment Coordinator.
The user shall further document O&M in a log which shall be available for
inspection by authorized agents of the City. At a minimum, the user shall
submit a semiannual calibration report performed by an outside representative
by the deadline defined in the user's discharge permit. The user may be
required to submit flow records to the Pretreatment Coordinator monthly.
   C.   Sampling Equipment:
      1.   The City may, at its option, based on water usage and/or waste
loadings or when the waste loads cannot be accurately evaluated by time
composite samples, require the user to install sampling equipment. This
equipment shall be installed and maintained by the user at its sole cost and
expense.
      2.   Users shall submit the procedure for O&M to the Pretreatment
Coordinator. The user shall further document O&M in a log which shall be
available for inspection by duly authorized agents of the City. At minimum, the
user shall submit an annual report confirming the accurate operation of the
equipment performed by an outside representative by the deadline defined in the
discharge permit.

or possess the characteristics enumerated in section
10-3F-2 of this chapter, or which are in violation of the standards for
pretreatment provided in chapter 1, EPA Rules and Regulations, subchapter D,
Water Programs, part 403 - “General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and
New Sources of Pollution”, published in Federal Register Volume 46, No. 18,
Wednesday, January 28, 1981, and any amendments thereto, and which, in the
judgment of the City, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works,
processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard
to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
reject the wastes, require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the public sanitary sewer, or require control over the quantities
and rates of discharge. If the Coordinator permits the pretreatment or
equalization of wastewater flows, the design and installation of the plants and
equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Coordinator and
subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
      2.   Review fee(s) as provided in the schedule of fees in section

(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3D-6: FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS:
Food service establishments (FSE) shall be required to comply with the
following requirements, as determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator.
Inspections of food service establishments will determine the potential for
adverse impact to the POTW. Facilities determined to have the potential to
adversely impact the POTW will be subject to the requirements in this section.
   A.   Grease Traps And Interceptors:
      1.   General Requirements: Grease traps and interceptors (collectively
referred to as grease interceptors or GI) shall be installed in all new food
service establishments as required by the Pretreatment Coordinator. All GI
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Coordinator based on an
evaluation of the volume and characteristics of the discharge in conjunction
with the operating plan of the FSE. The Coordinator may require GI to be
installed or modified in an existing FSE where said FSE has caused or
contributed to overflows and/or blockages in a public sewer or is suspected of
contributing to other fats, oil, or grease related problems, or at an existing
FSE that significantly remodels its site or when streetscapes or street/sewer
replacements are installed.
      2.   Location: All GI shall be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. All GI shall be located on the exterior to the building for all new
construction and, when feasible, at an existing FSE. The GI shall not be
located in drive-through lanes.
      3.   Sizing: Each FSE GI shall be sized to continuously produce an
effluent containing less than the guideline limit of fats, oil and grease (FOG)
based on the GI's hauling frequency. Minimum GI size shall be according to
section 840.510 of the Illinois Administrative Code.
      4.   Inspection Fee: An inspection fee as provided by the schedule of
fees in section
10-2-2 of this chapter shall be paid to the City prior to issuance of the
permit should it be determined that the user is required to install a GI.
      5.   Maintenance: Such grease traps shall be inspected, the grease cap
and solids blanket cleaned every three (3) months, the entire contents of the
trap cleaned annually and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner and/or
user at its sole cost and expense. It shall be the responsibility of the FSE to
inspect its GI during the pumping procedure to ensure the trap is properly
cleaned out and that all fittings and fixtures inside the trap are in working
condition and functioning properly. In the event that actual operations of the
GI fail to produce results that consistently prevent prohibitive discharges as
defined in section
10-3F-2 of this chapter, the owner and/or user of the FSE shall be required by
the Pretreatment Coordinator to have the GI cleaned at a more frequent rate or
install additional pretreatment as necessary.
      6.   Modifications: The Pretreatment Coordinator may make determinations
of GI adequacy, need, design, appropriateness, application, location,
modification(s), and conditional usage based on review of all relevant
information regarding GI performance, facility site and building plan review by
all regulatory reviewing agencies and may require repairs to, or modification
or replacement of, the GI.
      7.   General Permit Requirements: All FSE shall be required to be issued
a general permit as provided by articles H and I of this chapter.
   B.   External Grease Interceptor Criteria: GI installed at new and existing
FSE must meet the following criteria:
      1.   Size: The size shall be determined by the Pretreatment Coordinator
using a formula that is approved by the City. The minimum capacity of any one
unit shall be five hundred (500) gallons, and the maximum capacity shall be one
thousand five hundred (1,500) gallons. Where sufficient capacity cannot be
achieved with a single unit, installation of GI in series shall be required.
      2.   Twenty Five Percent Requirement: The GI shall provide for a minimum
hydraulic retention time of twenty four (24) minutes at actual peak flow
between the influent and effluent baffles, with twenty five percent (25%) of
the total volume of the GI being allowed for any food-derived solids to settle
or accumulate and floatable grease-derived materials to rise and accumulate,
identified as a solids blanket and grease cap, respectively.
      3.   Access Manholes: Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of twenty
four inches (24"), shall be provided over each exterior GI chamber and each
sanitary tee. The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and
be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The
manholes shall have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease
removal, and wastewater sampling activities.
      4.   Prohibitions: Dishwashers and food waste disposal units shall not be
connected to or discharged into any GI.
   C.   Waivers: Waivers that are available to FSE are set forth below. A
request for a waiver is required to be filed with the Pretreatment Coordinator
on a form provided by the City and the waiver review fee published in the
schedule of fees in section
10-2-2 of this chapter shall be paid to the City at the time of the filing.
Waiver requests are not considered to be filed until the request has been
reviewed and determined complete. If the Coordinator fails to act on a
completed waiver request within forty five (45) calendar days, a request for
waiver shall be deemed to be denied. The issuance of a waiver does not
eliminate the requirement to prevent prohibitive discharges through alternate
technologies and best management practices plans.
      1.   Existing External FSE Of Installation Waiver: The requirement to
install and to properly operate and maintain a GI is conditionally stayed by
the Pretreatment Coordinator. Terms and conditions for the waiver issued for a
GI installation shall be set forth in a permit. The terms may include the
requirement to install grease trap(s) inside the FSE, alternate technology and
the use of Best Management Practices. The waiver shall not apply to any
existing FSE that has not operated as an FSE for the last twelve (12)
consecutive months prior to the effective date hereof. Such FSEs shall be
required to install a GI in order to operate an FSE in the City sanitary sewer
service area.
      2.   Common GI Waiver: “Common GI” means one or more interceptors
receiving FOG laden wastewater from more than one establishment. Common
interceptors may be used in lieu of an individual GI at each FSE, provided a
waiver has been issued by the Pretreatment Coordinator. A common GI may be
located at shopping centers, malls, entertainment complexes, sporting arenas,
hotels, multi-tenant "flex" spaces, mixed use spaces, and other sites where
multiple establishments are connected to a single GI. The owner of the property
on which the common GI is located shall be responsible for operation and
maintenance of the common GI including program documentation, upkeep, and
repair. In such cases, a permit will be issued to the owner of the property for
the GI, and general permits will also be issued to each FSE connected to the
common GI that contains Best Management Practices requirements.
      3.   GI Installation Waiver For Limited Food Preparation Establishments:
Waivers for installations at FSEs with only a snack bar with no food
preparation other than food warming will be handled on a case-by-case basis by
the Pretreatment Coordinator and are deemed to be limited food preparation
establishments.
      4.   Constraint Waivers At Existing FSE: Where the installation of a GI
is not feasible and no equivalent alternative pretreatment can be installed, a
waiver from the installation of the GI requirement may be granted. The
Pretreatment Coordinator's determination to grant the waiver shall be based
upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions:
         a.   There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of
a GI; or
         b.   There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between the kitchen
plumbing fixtures and the GI and/or between the GI and the private collection
lines or public sewer; and
         c.   The use of alternative pretreatment technology is not possible
that is equally effective in controlling the FOG discharge.
      5.   Alternate Technology Waiver: The use of an automatic grease removal
system is permissible only upon the written approval of the Pretreatment
Coordinator, the plumbing inspector of the City, and the Iroquois County Health
Department. Approval of the technology shall be based on empirical data
acceptable to the DPW demonstrating removal efficiencies and reliability of
operation. The DPW may approve these types of technologies dependent on
manufacturer's specifications on a case- by-case basis. The DPW shall require
in a permit that any user of an alternate technology shall attain a grease
wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's outlet. Any user
utilizing an alternative technology may be subject to additional operational
requirements imposed by the DPW.
      6.   Cleaning Cycle Waiver: The FSE may petition the Pretreatment
Coordinator to reduce the cleaning and servicing of the GI from every three (3)
months to a maximum of every six (6) months upon demonstration that the amount
removed every three (3) months is significantly less than what would have to be
removed to allow for a hydraulic retention time of twenty four (24) minutes
using seventy five percent (75%) of the basin capacity and the discharge does
not exceed the oil and grease local limit.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3D-7: SEWER LINE MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT:
   A.   Responsibility Of Owner: The owner of real property shall be
responsible for the maintenance and repair of all sewer lines, including the
tap into the public sewer, located on its property.
   B.   Excavations In Public Ways: In those instances when a property owner
must excavate in order to maintain or replace a sewer line and, as a result,
the sidewalk, curb and/or street are removed or damaged, the property owner
shall be responsible for the restoration of the sidewalk, curb and/or street
(surface and sub-surface). Tunneling under the curb and sidewalk is recommended
whenever practical, but such improvements shall be saw-cut when removal is
required.
   C.   Compliance Required: All work, as it is related to the maintenance and/
or replacement of sewer lines shall be in conformance with the provisions of
the Watseka City Code and shall be inspected by a duly authorized agent of the
City during the repair and replacement.
   D.   City Involvement: With respect to sewer lines on private property
connecting to a single-family residence, the City may agree, in its sole and
absolute discretion, and only on the written request of a property owner, to
open and clean (i.e., jet or rod) a sewer line located on private property
immediate adjacent to and connecting to a public sewer, provided the City is
contemporaneously engaged in public sewer maintenance or replacement in the
public right-of-way adjacent to such property. No work shall be undertaken by
the City unless the Superintendent of the Sewer Department is satisfied that
there is no obvious indication that the sewer line will be damaged on account
of such work due its age or condition and, the City's involvement will not
adversely affect its ability to complete other work through the diversion of
manpower and/or equipment. Prior to engaging in such work, the property owner
shall:
      1.   Agree in writing to reimburse the City for its costs to complete the
work, including labor and equipment in accordance with such rates as may be
established by the Superintendent of the Sewer Department; and
      2.   Execute a release and waiver absolving the City of responsibility
for any and all damage to persons or property on account of such work.

hazardous wastes as defined in section
10-3J-9 of this chapter shall develop and implement a spill prevention/slug
control plan (SPSCP) consistent with the requirements in section
10-3G-4 of this chapter. The Pretreatment Coordinator may also determine that a
SPSCP is required for liquids and solids not previously described in previous
plans based on an evaluation of a site potential to cause spills or slug loads
to be introduced to the POTW.
   B.   Discharge Into Natural Outlets: It shall be unlawful to discharge into
any natural outlet within the City or in any area under the jurisdiction of the
City, any wastewaters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in
accordance with USEPA or IEPA requirements.
   C.   Discharge Into Storm Drainage Systems:
      1.   For reasons of the protection of the health, safety and welfare of
the inhabitants of the City, it is the policy of the City to prohibit
wastewaters from entering into any stormwater drainage system, and any such
discharge to the stormwater drainage systems is determined to be injurious to
the public health and welfare and is hereby declared a public nuisance.
      2.   It shall be unlawful for any person to connect or cause to be
connected any drain carrying, or designed to carry, any toilet, sink, basement,
septic tank, cesspool, or industrial waste, or any fixture or device
discharging polluting substances to any storm sewer or stormwater drainage
system within the corporate limits of the City.
      3.   Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to

outlet approved by the Superintendent of the Sewer Department. Industrial
cooling waters or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, upon approval of
the EPA, to a storm sewer or natural outlet.
   D.   Discharge Of Unpolluted Waters Upon Adjacent Property Or Public Ways
Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge in such manner as
to cause such waters to overflow onto adjacent property or to be discharged
upon any public street or public way, any stormwater, surface water,
groundwater, roof runoff, or subsurface drainage, including the use of a sump
pump for such purpose.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this section
shall, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to section
1-4-1 of this Code. A separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day
during or on which such person, firm or corporation violates the provisions of
this section.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013; amd. 2019 Code)
10-3F-3: NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   All nonresidential users subject to national categorical pretreatment
standards, promulgated by the USEPA in accordance with section 307(b) and (c)
of the act, currently discharging or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall
comply with all pretreatment standards and requirements. The national
categorical pretreatment standards set forth in 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N,
parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter.
   B.   Limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the
discharge from the process regulated by the standard or as otherwise specified
by the standard. Compliance with national categorical pretreatment standards is
mandatory. The national categorical standards may be contained in the IEPA
operating permit.
      1.   Upon the promulgation of the national categorical pretreatment
standard for a particular user, the said standard, if more stringent than the
limitation imposed under this chapter for sources in that category, shall, when
effective, immediately supersede the limitations and conditions imposed under
this chapter. The City shall notify all known affected users of the applicable
reporting requirements under 40 CFR section 403.12
      2.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c) unless specifically restricted by the
categorical pretreatment standard. These equivalent limitations calculated in
accordance with the following requirements are deemed pretreatment standards.
Users shall be required to comply with the equivalent limitations instead of
the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations
were derived. An alternative pretreatment limit shall not be used if the
alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the
regulated pollutants.
      3.   a.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations
expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent
concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to
individual users.
         b.   The Coordinator calculating equivalent mass-per-day limitations
shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by
the user’s average rate of production. This average rate of production shall be
based on a reasonable measure of the user's actual long-term daily production
during a representative year and not based on design production capacity. For
new sources, actual production shall be estimated using projected production.
         c.   The Coordinator shall calculate such limitations by dividing the
mass limitations by the average daily flow rate of the user’s regulated process
wastewater. The average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable
measure of the user’s actual long-term average flow rate, such as the average
daily flow rate during the representative year.
      4.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard prior to any
pretreatment, the Coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the
combined waste stream formula set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(e); provided, that the
applicable categorical regulation allows the wastewaters to be mixed, and the
user can supply the information necessary to allow issuance of an alternative
limit.
      5.   A user may request a variance from USEPA based on fundamentally
different factors. The request must comply with the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13.
      6.   A user may request an adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard to account for pollutant loadings in the user's intake water (a net/
gross adjustment) in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
      7.   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of pollutant concentrations, a user may request that the City convert the
limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration
limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Pretreatment Coordinator.
The City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the user meets all the
conditions set forth in subsection B7a below.
         a.   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the user must:
            (1)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water
conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during
the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit;
            (2)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
            (3)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
            (4)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
            (5)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the user’s request for
equivalent mass limits.
         b.   A user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
            (1)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
            (2)   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use
of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
            (3)   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the Pretreatment Coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by
more than twenty percent (20%) from its baseline production rates determined in
subsection B7a(3) of this section. Upon notification of a revised production
rate, the Coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
            (4)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection B7a(1) of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
         c.   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Pretreatment
Coordinator:
            (1)   Shall calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the user by the
concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
            (2)   Shall reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the
limit necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility upon notification
of a revised production rate from the user; and
            (3)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the user's actual average daily
flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water
conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates
used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on
the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection
10-3F-2A2 of this article.
      8.   The Pretreatment Coordinator may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR parts 414, 419 and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Coordinator.
      9.   Once included in its wastewater discharge permit, the user must
comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the
promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
      10.   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitations.
      11.   Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit
incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a
production-based standard shall notify the Coordinator within two (2) workdays
after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user which fails to
timely notify the Coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in its wastewater discharge permit that
were based on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate.
   C.   All users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment
standards are required to file reports as required in sections
10-3J-3 and
10-3J-4 of this chapter, signed by an authorized representative. Such reports
shall include all information that the Coordinator deems necessary to make
compliance determinations.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3F-4: STATE LIMITS:
All users are subject to State water quality standards and requirements as set
forth in 35 Illinois Administrative Code (IAC) 307. Specifically, the standards
for discharge of mercury and cyanide are as follows:
   A.   Mercury Section (Amended at 28 Ill. Reg. 3076, effective February 6,
2004):
      1.   Except as provided below, no person may cause or allow the
concentration of mercury in any discharge to a publicly owned or publicly
regulated sewer system to exceed the following level, subject to the averaging
rule contained in 35 Illinois Administrative Code 304.104(a):
 
Constituent STORET Number Concentration
                          mg/L
Mercury     71990         0.0005
 
      2.   It will be an exception to subsection A1 of this section if the
discharge is to a publicly owned or publicly regulated sewer system that is
required to meet a limitation less stringent than the 0.0005 milligrams per
liter mercury concentration, in which case, the discharge limitation must be
the same as that applicable to the publicly owned or regulated sewer system to
which it discharges.
      3.   It will be an exception to subsection A1 of this section if all the
following conditions are met:
         a.   The discharger does not use mercury, the discharger uses mercury
and this use cannot be eliminated, or the discharger uses mercury only in
chemical analysis or in the laboratory or other equipment and takes reasonable
care to avoid contamination of wastewater;
         b.   The discharger mercury concentration is less than 0.003
milligrams per liter, as determined by application of the averaging rules of 35
Illinois Administrative Code 304.104(a);
         c.   The discharger is providing the best degree of treatment
consistent with technological feasibility, economic reasonableness, and sound
engineering judgment. This may include no treatment for mercury; and
         d.   The discharger has an inspection and maintenance program likely
to reduce or to prevent an increase in the level of mercury discharges.
      4.   The discharge of wastes from medicinal or therapeutic use of
mercury, exclusive of laboratory use, will be exempt from the limitations of
subsection A1 of this section if all the following conditions are met:
         a.   The total plant discharge is less than two hundred twenty seven
grams (227 g) (½ pound) as Hg in any year;
         b.   This discharge is to a public sewer system; and
         c.   The discharge does not, alone or in conjunction with other
sources, cause the effluent from the sewer system or treatment plant to exceed
0.0005 milligram per liter of mercury.
      5.   No person may cause or allow any discharge of mercury to a publicly
owned or publicly regulated sewer system which, alone or in combination with
other sources, causes a violation by the sewer treatment plant discharge of the
water quality standard of 35 Illinois Administrative Code 302 for mercury
applicable in the receiving stream.
      6.   For purposes of permit issuance, the agency may consider application
of the exception of subsection A2 or A3 of this section to determine compliance
with this section. The agency may impose permit conditions necessary or
required to assure continued application of the exception. When subsection A2
or A3 of this section applies, the agency may impose an effluent limitation in
the permit that allows the discharge of a concentration of mercury greater than
0.0005 milligram per liter but not more than 0.003 milligram per liter.
   B.   Cyanide Section (Amended at 28111, Reg. 3076, effective February 6,
2004):
      1.   No waste to any public sewer system must contain more than ten
milligrams per liter (10 mg/L) total cyanide (STORET number 00720), provided
any sample tested must not release more than two milligrams per liter (2 mg/L)
of cyanide when tested at a pH of 4.5 and at a temperature of sixty six degrees
Celsius (66°C) (150°F) for a period of thirty (30) minutes, except as permitted
by subsection B2 of this section.
      2.   Upon application by the City and approval by the agency, based upon
determination by the agency that no violation of the effluent standards of 35
Illinois Administrative Code 304 will result and that no hazard to workers in
such sewage works will result, limited additional amounts of cyanide exceeding
the standards in subsection B1 of this section may be discharged to the sewage
works of the City.
      3.   Nothing in this section may be construed as limiting the authority
of the City to impose any more stringent standards or limitations on cyanide
discharges to its sewage works.
      4.   Any actions undertaken pursuant to subsection B2 of this section
will be subject to the limitations of 35 IAC section 307.2400(b)(7).
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3F-5: CITY’S RIGHT OF REVISION:
   A.   The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits or general wastewater discharge permits, more
stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with
the purpose of this chapter. The specific limitations on discharges are derived
from the Maximum Allowable Industrial Loading (MAIL) calculation. The MAILs are
allocated only to those users, at the City's discretion, that contribute the
regulated pollutant. All remaining users are held to either the background
concentration or slightly higher than background but lower than the specific
discharge limit. In no case shall the sum of allocations exceed the MAIL.
   B.   The City will maintain a reserve of the maximum allowable headworks
pollutant loading for each pollutant for new industries or increase of
pollutant loading from existing industries. The City will recalculate the
maximum concentrations from time to time using site specific data and will
consider revisions to State and Federal regulations that may impact the
calculations.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3F-6: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
   A.   Monitoring Facilities:
      1.   Sampling Manhole Applicability:
         a.   All nonresidential users are required to install a sampling
manhole for each separate discharge of a building sewer into the public sewer
in accordance with section
10-3D-3 of this chapter with the plans and specifications approved by the City.
When required by the City, an SIU or NSRU that does not have a unique sampling
chamber at the end of the pipe shall install a monitoring manhole or sampling
chamber for use as the local limits regulatory sampling location along the
building sewer, in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the
City. A sampling chamber may be required to be installed within the building.
         b.   When required by the Pretreatment Coordinator, a categorical
industrial user shall install a monitoring manhole or sampling chamber for use
as the regulatory sampling location of the categorically regulated discharge in
the building sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the
City. This sampling chamber may be required to be installed within the building
and may be in addition to an end-of-pipe manhole.
         c.   In the event that a suitable sampling facility does not exist at
an existing building, the “sampling manhole” shall be considered to be either
the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer from the point at which the
building sewer is connected or the point of process wastewater discharge if
accessible by the City.
      2.   Wastewater Monitoring And/Or Flow Measurement Facility Operation And
Maintenance:
         a.   Such facilities shall be installed and maintained at all times at
the user's sole cost and expense. The failure of a user to maintain its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for a user to
assert that the sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
Installation of such facilities will be consistent with the requirements of
section
10-3D-4 of this chapter.
         b.   The manhole or chamber located on a building sewer discharge
located in dedicated easements shall be easily accessible to duly authorized
agents twenty four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week.
         c.   The manhole or chamber at a discharge location within the
building shall be accessible to representatives of the City or their duly
authorized agents during normal operating hours.
         d.   The sampling chamber, flow metering device, sampling equipment
and documentation of the frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analyses
of samples shall be subject, at all reasonable times, to inspection by a duly
authorized agent.
         e.   Metered water supply may be used to determine wastewater flow if
it is substantiated to the City that the metered water supply and wastewater
quantities are approximately the same, or where an adjustment agreed to by the
Pretreatment Coordinator is made in the metered water supply to determine
wastewater flow and is documented through the use of sub-meters and/or
production records. In the event that the wastewater flow cannot be
substantiated at any regulated location, the user shall be required to install
flow monitoring consistent with section
10-3D-4 of this chapter.
         f.   Under authorization from the City, users may be permitted to
install additional water meters on the exterior of the user's structure at the
user’s sole cost and expense for the purpose of measuring water not discharged
to the City sanitary sewer system. All users shall register with the City and
provide information requested by the City concerning the installation of
additional water meters. The Building Official shall have the right to inspect
and regulate the installation of additional water meters. The wastewater volume
discharged to the City sanitary sewer system shall be determined by subtracting
the volume shown on the additional water meter(s) from the total metered amount
of water supplied to the premises.
         g.   In the event the City, or surrounding area, should suffer from a
water shortage, the City Council shall have the authority to suspend the
provisions of subsection A2e of this section, in order to encourage the
conservation of water resources. In the event that the Mayor of the City
determines and declares that such water shortage exists to such an extent and
degree as to constitute an emergency, then the Mayor shall have the authority
to suspend the provisions of subsection A2e of this section, pending
ratification by the City Council at its next regularly scheduled meeting
following the suspension by the Mayor. In determining whether a water shortage
exists, the Mayor and City Council may consider water shortages in the
surrounding area in addition to the adequacy of the supply of the City water
system. In the event that a future water shortage appears evident, the
provisions of subsection A2e of this section may also be suspended by the Mayor
or City Council prior to the existence of an emergency.
   B.   Monitoring Requirements:
      1.   Applicability: All significant industrial users (including
categorical industrial users) and nonsignificant regulated users are required
to sample based on the monitoring frequency as stated in the applicable
wastewater discharge permit other users are required to sample upon the request
of the City. A user shall pay the cost of sampling of its discharge and the
cost of analyses of its samples, whether or not the sampling and analyses are
performed by the user or by the POTW.
      2.   Frequency:
         a.   All significant industrial users, including categorical
industrial users, shall sample their effluent(s) for the parameters specified
in its wastewater discharge permit, and report the results to the Pretreatment
Coordinator at a minimum of at least twice per year or more frequently as
designated in the permit. The City shall have the right to perform its own
sampling at any time.
         b.   Any nonsignificant regulated users with an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit shall sample their effluent and report the results
to the Coordinator consistent with the requirements of the wastewater discharge
permit and the City monitoring frequency.
         c.   The sampling frequency listed in a wastewater discharge permit
may be modified by the Coordinator in the event that additional samples are
needed to demonstrate consistent compliance.
      3.   Sample Collection:
         a.   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements shall be
based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative
of conditions occurring during the reporting period as defined in the
wastewater discharge permit.
         b.   Except as indicated in subsection B3c of this section, the user
shall collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques.
         c.   In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the
Coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling at minimum
collecting samples every fifteen (15) minutes during a 24-hour workday; or a
minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will
provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. A
proportional number of samples shall be collected for wastewater discharges
less than twenty four (24) hours.
         d.   Single grab samples shall be required by the Coordinator in the
event of an infrequent batch discharge or to show compliance with instantaneous
discharge limits.
         e.   Samples for fats, oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide,
hexavalent chromium, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds shall be
obtained using the number of grab samples determined by the Coordinator to
assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. Multiple grab samples that are individually preserved as
specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate USEPA guidance that are collected
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis, as follows:
            (1)   For, cyanide, hexavalent chromium, phenols, and sulfides,
multiple grab samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field.
            (2)   For volatile organics and oil and grease, multiple grab
samples may only be composited in the laboratory.
         f.   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved USEPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Coordinator, as appropriate.
   C.   Analytical Requirements: All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the USEPA
determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling
and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Coordinator or
other parties approved by USEPA.

and specifications shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facilities as necessary to comply with the provisions of this
chapter.
   B.   All users are required to comply with IEPA permitting requirements. A
user shall file an IEPA application for a construction-operating permit prior
to construction or significant modification of a pretreatment system that has
been signed off by the City and obtain either a permit from the IEPA or a
letter indicating no permit is needed prior to the City connection and/or
wastewater discharge permit(s) being issued. No sources of nonresidential
wastewater shall be discharged to the POTW until all permitting requirements
have been satisfied. All pretreatment facilities designated by the Coordinator
shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA-certified wastewater
operator even if the user is not issued an IEPA operating permit.
   C.   Any subsequent proposed modification, alteration, or change to the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be submitted to the City

10-3G-3: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
   A.   The City may require the additional pretreatment measures set forth
below. The City reserves the right to make unannounced inspections of any
additional pretreatment measures during normal business hours whether or not
the user has been issued an individual or general wastewater discharge permit.
      1.   Whenever deemed necessary, the Coordinator may require a user to
restrict its discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific public sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and make other such actions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
      2.   The Coordinator may require any user discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on its property and at its sole cost and expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. This
device shall be approved by the Coordinator. The City may issue an individual
or general wastewater discharge permit solely for flow equalization.
      3.   The Coordinator may require a user discharging to the POTW to
install and maintain facilities to limit the amount of grease, oil, and sand
entering the POTW through the procedures outlined in subsection
10-3D-4B of this chapter.
      4.   The Coordinator may require a user with the potential to discharge
flammable substances into any public sewer to install and maintain, on its
property and at its own cost and expense, a combustible gas detection meter.
This meter shall be approved by the Coordinator.
      5.   No statement contained in this subsection shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial user whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to the conditions of the
City's general pretreatment program.
   B.   While performing the necessary work on private properties, the
Coordinator, duly authorized employees of the City, consultants retained by the
City, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the user, and the user shall be held harmless for injury or
death to the City employees, and the City shall indemnify the user against
liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted
against the user, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the
user to maintain safe conditions.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3G-4: SPILL PREVENTION/SLUG CONTROL PLAN:
   A.   Required:
      1.   A user shall develop, implement and maintain a spill prevention/slug
control plan hereafter referred to as an SPSC plan if the user has:

recycled, final products, or utility chemicals) that total or exceed two
hundred fifty (250) gallons or five (5) 55-gallon drums at or on its site;
         b.   Prohibited discharge materials as defined in section
10-3F-2 of this chapter at or on its site; or
         c.   Hazardous waste as defined in section
10-3J-9 of this chapter at or on its site; or
         d.   Been defined by the Pretreatment Coordinator to have a need to
control slug discharges.
      2.   Any user that meets the above criteria shall develop and implement
an SPSC plan regardless of whether or not that user is regulated by an
individual or general wastewater discharge permit.
   B.   Minimum Requirements: The SPSC plan, which is required to be submitted
to the City if the user's discharge is regulated, shall address, at a minimum,
the following:
      1.   Specifics Of SPSC Plan:
         a.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
         b.   Description of stored chemicals, including quantity of chemicals
and type and number of storage containers;
         c.   Site diagram showing location of all tanks holding greater than
or equal to two hundred fifty (250) gallons or areas containing five (5) 55-
gallon drums or more of raw materials, prohibited wastes, hazardous wastes,
wastes to be recycled, or final product;
         d.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures shall include, but are not limited to, routine
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
measures specific to slug discharge control, worker training, building of
containment structures or equipment, inventory of spill response equipment,
measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and
measures and equipment for emergency response. Building containment structures
or production equipment changes are considered procedures to prevent adverse
spills. If containment structures are connected to the public sewer, a shutoff
valve is required and shall be left in a closed position;
         e.   Location of notices/signs posted in conspicuous places advising
employees in English and the language of common use whom to call in the event
of a spill, accidental discharge of prohibited materials, slug discharge or a
bypass of any part of a pretreatment system; and
         f.   Emergency telephone number(s) (24-hour) off-site and backup
telephone number(s) and other contact information (e.g., address, e-mail
address, etc.) for responsible site staff. Once an SPSC plan has been filed
with the City, any change in such information should be submitted within five
(5) workdays after revision.
      2.   Notification Procedure: The SPSC plan shall contain procedures for
immediately notifying the Pretreatment Coordinator of any accidental or slug
discharge, as required by section
10-3J-7 of this chapter.
      3.   Documentation: The SPSC plan shall contain a sample of the
documentation maintained at the site that:
         a.   Ensures that all employees who are in a position to cause,
discover, or observe such discharge are advised of the emergency notification
procedures and the training is documented with the date and time of training
and the employee’s signature; and
         b.   Verifies inspection and maintenance procedures to prevent adverse
impacts and confirm that said procedures are being performed on a regular
basis. At minimum, logs are required to verify valves in containment
structures, if present, are closed.
   C.   Submission Of Plan: The SPSC plan shall be submitted to the Coordinator
when the plan is required in an individual or general wastewater discharge
permit. Review of an SPSC plan by the City shall not relieve the user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility or SPSC plan as necessary to meet
all requirements of this chapter. Review by the City does not constitute an
approval of the SPSC plan, and the City and its duly authorized agent(s) are
not responsible for the actions of the user and any impacts the user may cause
as a result of a spill or slug load.
   D.   Evaluation And Revisions To Plan:
      1.   At least once every two (2) years, the Coordinator shall require
each significant industrial user to evaluate the need to revise its SPSC plan.
The Coordinator may require any user to submit, at a frequency less than two
(2) years, such SPSC plan or require modification of an existing SPSC plan
based on changes that have occurred at the site or in response to an incident
that had the potential to impact the POTW.
      2.   In alternate years, the Coordinator shall evaluate whether each
nonsignificant regulated user is required to file a revision to its SPSC plan
based on changes that have occurred at the site or in response to an incident
that had the potential to impact the POTW.
   E.   Implementation Of Plan: All SPSC plans shall be implemented by the user
whether or not they have been reviewed by the City.

(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3H-2: PERMIT ISSUANCE AUTHORITY AND CONDITIONS:
   A.   The Coordinator may issue a user a wastewater discharge permit as
follows:
      1.   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Issued To Significant
Industrial Users (SIUs) (Which Includes Categorical Industrial Users (CIUs) Not
Identified As Nonsignificant CIUs): No SIU, including any CIU, shall discharge
wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining an individual wastewater
discharge permit issued by the City; except, that an existing SIU that has
filed a timely application pursuant to section
10-3H-3 of this article may continue to discharge for the time period specified
herein. Alternately, the City may issue general wastewater discharge permits to
an SIU or CIU if the conditions in subsection A2 of this section are met.
      2.   General Wastewater Discharge Permit Issued To SIUs And CIUs: At the
discretion of the Coordinator, the City may issue a general wastewater
discharge permit to control discharges from SIUs or CIUs to the POTW if the
following conditions are true of all facilities controlled by a general
wastewater discharge permit:
         a.   Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;
         b.   Discharge the same types of waste;
         c.   Require the same effluent limitations or best management
practices;
         d.   Require the same or similar monitoring and/or reporting
requirements; and
         e.   In the opinion of the Coordinator, are more appropriately
controlled under a general wastewater discharge permit than under an individual
wastewater discharge permit.
      3.   Other Wastewater Discharge Permits: The Coordinator may require
other nonresidential users to obtain either individual or general wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Such
a wastewater discharge permit shall state that the holder of such a permit
issued under this section is not classified as an SIU or CIU. A user with a
wastewater discharge permit in this class may include, but is not limited to:
         a.   Any user that has been determined to be a nonsignificant
categorical industrial user, as defined in section
10-3B-2 of this chapter, definition of “significant industrial user or SIU”,
subsection C.
         b.   Any user that has been determined not to be a “significant
industrial user”, as defined in section
10-3B-2 of this chapter, that requires regulation by a wastewater discharge
permit;
         c.   Any user subject to national categorical pretreatment standards
that opts not to discharge process waste shall be issued a zero process
wastewater discharge permit;
         d.   Any user that is a noncategorical zero process wastewater
discharger that the Coordinator determines shall be permitted;
         e.   Any nonsignificant regulated user (NSRU) set forth below:
            (1)   An NSRU that discharges a process wastewater flow greater
than or equal to 0.005 percent of the POTW's design dry-weather hydraulic
capacity, or five thousand (5,000) gallons per day, whichever is smaller;
            (2)   An NSRU that discharges more than or equal to 0.005 percent
of the design dry-weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW;
            (3)   An NSRU that discharges 0.005 percent of the maximum
allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by a local limit set
forth in section
10-3F-2 of this chapter; or
            (4)   An NSRU that intermittently discharges any individual batch
or batches that would meet the criteria in subsections A3e(1), (2), or (3)
above when discharged or otherwise have the potential to discharge a slug load
to the POTW;
         f.   Any user that has device(s) installed to remove oils, grease and
sand;
         g.   Any food service establishment (FSE); and
         h.   Any user required to eliminate or control specified pollutants
from its wastewater through the development and implementation of a Best
Management Practice (BMP) Plan.
   B.   A scenario may arise that a user that is subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards opts not to discharge, as described in
subsection A of this section, but the wastewater discharged is classified as
significant. Both an SIU permit and a zero process wastewater discharge permit
should be issued in this case.
   C.   Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
subject the user to the sanctions set out in articles L, M, and N of this
chapter. Obtaining an individual or general wastewater discharge permit does
not relieve a user of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of
Federal, State, and local law.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3H-3: PERMITS FOR EXISTING CONNECTIONS:
   A.   Any existing SIU, including CIU, required to obtain an individual or
general wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the
POTW prior to September 15, 2013, and who wishes to continue such discharges in
the future, shall, within sixty (60) calendar days after said date, apply to
the Coordinator for the appropriate wastewater discharge permit in accordance
with section
10-3H-5 of this article, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to
continue after one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of September 15, 2013,
except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the
Coordinator.
   B.   Any existing non-SIU required to obtain an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit shall file an application within the time period
specified in a notification provided by the Coordinator.
   C.   No user shall discharge, or cause to discharge, any wastewater from a
food service establishment (FSE) directly or indirectly into the POTW without
first obtaining an FSE wastewater discharge permit. The City will implement the
FSE permit process by issuing a survey as provided by article E of this chapter
specific to FSE. Any FSE that completes and submits a survey in the time frame
required by the City will be deemed to have complied with the permit
requirements during the implementation of this program. The completed survey
shall serve as the wastewater discharge permit application for the FSE.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3H-4: PERMITS FOR NEW CONNECTIONS:
   A.   Any CIU proposing to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must
obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of
such discharge. An application for this individual or general wastewater
discharge permit, in accordance with section
10-3H-5 of this article, must be filed at least ninety (90) calendar days prior
to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
   B.   Any non-CIU proposing to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW
that is required to obtain an individual or general wastewater discharge permit
must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such
discharge, or operations in the case of a zero process discharger, in
accordance with section

wastewater discharge permit application.
   B.   General Application:
      1.   Users Generally: The Coordinator may require all users that are
required to obtain a general wastewater discharge permit to submit an
application, on a form provided by the City, which is specific to the category
regulated by the general wastewater discharge permit. The form may require, but
is not limited to, contact information, production processes, the types of
wastes generated, and the location for monitoring all wastewaters if regulated
by the general wastewater discharge permit. If a pretreatment standard requires
compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall
submit documentation as required by the Coordinator.
      2.   Food Service Establishments (FSE): The Coordinator may require all
FSE that are required to obtain a general wastewater discharge permit to submit
an application on a form provided by the City which is specific to the FSE. The
form may require, but is not limited to, contact information; general business
information; facility operation; kitchen fixtures; fats, oil and grease
handling; kitchen cleanup and water usage; grease interceptor or alternatives
used; and sampling locations. The City requires the FSE to comply with a BMP,
and the FSE shall submit documentation as required by the Coordinator.
   C.   Categorical Monitoring Waivers:
      1.   Authority: The City may authorize a user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the user has demonstrated through sampling
and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected
to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from
intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the
user. This waiver is not available to users whose concentration standards are
derived from mass standards or production-based standards. This waiver is
subject to the following conditions:
         a.   The monitoring waiver may only be authorized where a pollutant is
determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the
facility; provided, that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard and otherwise includes no process
wastewater.
         b.   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequently issued individual
wastewater discharge permit.
         c.   This subsection C1 does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
      2.   Application Requirements:
         a.   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         b.   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with section
10-3H-6 of this article, and include the certification statement in said
section
10-3H-6.
         c.   Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the USEPA approved method from 40 CFR part
136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
   Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be
returned to the user for revision.
      3.   Documentation And Record Retention For CIU Monitoring Waivers: Any
grant of the monitoring waiver by the Coordinator shall be included as a
condition in the user’s wastewater discharge permit. The reasons supporting the
waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver
shall be maintained by the Coordinator for three (3) years after expiration of
the waiver.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3H-6: APPLICATION SIGNATURES AND CERTIFICATION:
   A.   All wastewater discharge permit applications, user reports and
certification statements shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
user and contain the following certification statement:
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
      I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments

user within ninety (90) calendar days from the end of the compliance schedule
deadline to verify the success or failure of the entire schedule. The final
report will, if appropriate, identify the steps being taken by the user to
resolve noncompliance.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3J-3: PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CATEGORICAL INDUSTRIAL USERS:
In the event that either the City, a user or IEPA determines that the user is
regulated as a categorical industrial user by standards and requirements
promulgated by the IEPA in accordance with section 307(b) and (c) of the act,
the following reports are required to be filed by the user with the City.
   A.   Baseline Monitoring Reports:
      1.   Within either one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final
administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4),
whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging
to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the Coordinator a
report which contains the information listed in subsection A3 of this section.
      2.   At least ninety (90) calendar days prior to commencement of its
discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall
submit to the Coordinator a report which contains the information listed in
subsection A3 of this section. A new source shall report the method of
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards, and
shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to
be discharged.
      3.   Users described in subsections A1 and A2 of this section shall
submit the information set forth below to the Coordinator:
         a.   Identifying Information: The name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owner.
         b.   Environmental Permits: A list of any environmental control
permits held by or for the facility.
         c.   Description Of Operations: A brief description of the nature,
average rate of production (including each product produced by type, amount,
processes, and rate of production), and standard industrial classifications of
the operation(s) carried out by the user. This description should include a
schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from
the regulated processes.
         d.   Flow Measurement: Information showing the measured average daily
and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process
streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
         e.   Measurements Of Pollutants:
            (1)   The user shall identify the categorical pretreatment
standards applicable to each regulated process;
            (2)   The user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the
categorical pretreatment standard or by the Coordinator of regulated pollutants
in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average
concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be
representative of daily operations. In cases where the categorical pretreatment
standard requires a best management practice or pollution prevention
alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the Coordinator
or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the categorical
pretreatment standard;
            (3)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
complete the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection

cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, hexavalent chromium, and
volatile organic compounds.
            (4)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure
the flows and concentrations necessary to allow the use of the combined waste
stream formula of 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with all
pretreatment standards. Similar methodology may be used to evaluate limits for
users that combine waste streams after pretreatment but before monitoring at
the discretion of the Coordinator. Where an alternate concentration or mass
limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted
limit, along with supporting data, may be submitted to the USEPA or IEPA;
            (5)   Sampling shall be performed in accordance with procedures set
out in subsection
10-3F-6B of this chapter, and samples shall be analyzed in accordance with
procedures set out in subsection
10-3F-6C of this chapter;
            (6)   The Coordinator may allow the submission of a baseline report
which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
            (7)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place
of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the City;
         f.   Compliance Certification: A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative (as defined in section
10-3B-2 of this chapter, definition of "authorized representative of the
user"), and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required for the CIU to meet the pretreatment standards and
requirements; and
         g.   Compliance Schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which
the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion
date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established
for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to
this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection B of this
section.
         h.   Signature And Report Certification: All baseline monitoring
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section
10-3H-6 of this chapter.
   B.   Compliance Schedule Progress Reports: The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection A3g of this section:
      1.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to:
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      2.   No increment referred to in subsection B1 of this section shall
exceed nine (9) calendar months;

than fourteen (14) calendar days following each date in the schedule and the
final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule;
      4.   In no event shall more than nine (9) calendar months elapse between
such progress reports to the Coordinator; and
      5.   All compliance schedule progress reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with section
10-3H-6 of this chapter.
   C.   Reports On Compliance With Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline:
      1.   Within ninety (90) calendar days following the date for final
compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case
of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into
the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements
shall submit to the Coordinator a report containing the information described
in subsection A of this section.
      2.   For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report

specified by the City in a wastewater discharge permit), submit a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which
are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with section
10-3H-6 of this chapter.
      2.   These reports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in
the period covered by the report, and performed in accordance with the
techniques described in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the CIU’s discharge and comply with the
requirements of subsections
10-3F-6B and C of this chapter.
      3.   This sampling and analysis may be performed by the City in lieu of
the CIU at the discretion of the Coordinator. In such cases, the City will
issue an attachment to the wastewater discharge permit that specifies the City
will perform sampling and analysis semiannually at minimum. The CIU shall
reimburse the City for all costs and expenses incurred for such sampling and
analysis.
      4.   If a CIU subject to the reporting requirements in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Coordinator, using
the procedures prescribed in subsections
10-3F-6B and C of this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be
included in the report.
      5.   Where the City has imposed mass limitations on a CIU as provided for
by 40 CFR 403.6(c), the report required by subsection B1 of this section shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by the pretreatment standards in the
discharge from the CIU.
      6.   For a CIU subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the City in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c),
the report required by subsection B1 of this section shall contain a reasonable
measure of the user's long- term production rate. For all other CIUs subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the
report required by subsection B1 of this section shall include the user's
actual average production rate for the reporting period.
      7.   In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a
best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the CIU
must submit documentation required by the Coordinator or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      8.   Upon approval of a monitoring waiver for pollutants found to be not
present and revision of the user’s permit by the Coordinator, the CIU must
certify on each periodic report with the statement in section
10-3H-6 of this chapter that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
waste stream due to activities of the user with the following statement:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR ________ (specify
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard part(s)), I certify that,
to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level
of the ________ (list the categorically regulated pollutant(s)) in the
Wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last
periodic report.
      9.   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection
B1 of this section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by
the Coordinator, and notify the Coordinator.
   C.   Nonsignificant Categorical Users: “Nonsignificant categorical
industrial users”, as defined in section
10-3B-2 of this chapter, definition of “significant industrial user or SIU”,
subsection C, shall, at a frequency determined by the Coordinator but no less
frequently than annually (on dates specified by the City in a wastewater
discharge permit), submit a report which contains the certification statement
named “Nonsignificant Categorical Industrial User Certification Form” on file
in the Office of the City Clerk.
   D.   Other Nonsignificant Regulated Users:
      1.   Categorical zero process dischargers, noncategorical zero process
dischargers, batch dischargers, food service establishments and any firms
regulated by individual or general wastewater discharge permit requirements
including, but not limited to, best management practices shall, at a frequency
determined by the Coordinator, submit a periodic report at a frequency defined
in the applicable wastewater discharge permit.
      2.   The reports may require sampling and analyses or some other measure
to determine compliance with permit pretreatment standards and requirements.
The user must submit documentation necessary to determine the compliance status
of the user as defined by the Coordinator and identified in the wastewater
discharge permit.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3J-5: REPORTS FROM USERS NOT REQUIRING A PERMIT:
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports under the conditions required by the Coordinator. These
reports may include, but are not limited to, surveys of business activities,
water usage, wastes discharged, spill and slug loading potential, pretreatment
equipment, waste hauling and facility layout.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3J-6: CHANGED CONDITIONS:
   A.   Authorized Representative Change Notification: Any significant
industrial user that changes the authorized representative of its company shall
file a change notice with the City within thirty (30) calendar days of the
effective date of the change.
   B.   Reports Of Changed Conditions:
      1.   Each user must notify the Coordinator of any planned substantial
changes to the user’s operations or system which might alter the nature,
quality, or volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) calendar days before
the change. Immediate shutdowns or deletions of products are required to be
noticed within five (5) workdays of determination.
      2.   The Coordinator may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section
10-3H-5 of this chapter.
      3.   The Coordinator may issue or modify an existing individual or
general wastewater discharge permit under sections
10-3I-2 and
10-3I-4 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
      4.   For purposes of this requirement, substantial changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or greater, the
addition or deletion of a shift, the discharge of any previously unreported
pollutants including changes to the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes
for which the user has submitted initial notification under section
10-3J-9 of this article, introduction of a pollutant for which a monitoring
waiver had been obtained, the addition of a new process regardless of waste
discharge or lack of discharge, shutdown of a process, or addition or deletion
of a product.
      5.   Significant industrial users and categorical industrial users are
required to notify the Coordinator of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a slug discharge.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3J-7: REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:
   A.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, or a slug load that may cause potential problems for the POTW, any
user shall immediately telephone (within 15 minutes) and notify the Coordinator
of the incident. If this notification cannot be made to the POTW staff during
routine business hours, the user shall notify the ICOM (Iroquois County
Communications Dispatch Center) at (815)432-7224. This notification shall
include the name of the caller, location of the discharge, physical state of
the discharge, chemical composition, concentration and volume, if known, and
date and time of discharge as well as duration of the discharge, and corrective
actions taken by the user. The notification shall include what Federal, State
and local entities have also been notified by the user.
   B.   The user shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   C.   Within five (5) workdays following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the Coordinator, submit a detailed written report describing
the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences.
   D.   Such notifications shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   E.   A notice/sign shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees in English and the language of
common use whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection A
of this section, as described in the user's spill prevention/slug control plan.
Employers shall ensure through documentation that all employees who may cause
such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3J-8: NOTICE OF VIOLATION; REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING:
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Coordinator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the Coordinator within thirty (30) calendar days after
becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the
City monitors at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the City
samples between the user’s initial sampling and when the user receives the
results of this sampling. If the City performed the sampling and analysis in
lieu of the user, the City will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless
it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the
repeat sampling and analysis.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3J-9: NOTIFICATION OF DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE:
   A.   Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12(P), any user who commences the discharge of
hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the USEPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the
name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the USEPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other). If the user discharges more than one hundred kilograms (100 kg) of such
waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and is readily
available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be
discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take
place no later than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once
for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under subsection
10-3J-6B of this article. The notification requirement in this subsection does
not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections
10-3J-3A and C and 10-3J-4B of this chapter.
   B.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection A of this
section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
kilograms (15 kg) of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
fifteen kilograms (15 kg) of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or
of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one- time notification. Subsequent months during which
the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.
   C.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Coordinator, the USEPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substances within
ninety (90) calendar days of the effective date of such regulations.
   D.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
   E.   This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit issued hereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3J-10: DUE DATES OF REPORTS:
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked.
For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility
serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern. In order to meet deadlines, reports may be faxed or e-mailed on
the due date to the City. The original of the fax or e-mail is required to be
mailed to the City postmarked within one workday of the transmission.

   A.   The Pretreatment Coordinator and his designee(s), duly authorized
agents of the City, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA), and
the United States Environmental Protection Agency, hereafter referred to as
“the above-named entities”, shall have the right to enter the premises of any
user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this
chapter and any individual or general wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder. Users shall allow the above-named entities ready access to
all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, analyses, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
   B.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, the above-named entities will be permitted to enter without
delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   C.   The above-named entities shall have the right to set up on the user’s
property or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations, inspect the premises for
leaks or stoppages, or place dye in the sanitary pipe so to ascertain whether
or not the sanitary pipe is draining into the proper City sewer system.
   D.   The Coordinator may require the user to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own
cost and expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall
be calibrated twice yearly (at 6 month intervals) to ensure their accuracy. The
user shall submit these calibration reports semiannually to the Coordinator
with the periodic compliance reports required in section
10-3J-4 of this chapter.
   E.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Coordinator and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
   F.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the above-named entities access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   G.   In the event that a suitable sampling facility does not exist, pursuant
to section

If any of the above-named entities have been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, of the user, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the
overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the above-
named entity may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Circuit Court of
Iroquois County.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3K-3: RECORDKEEPING:
   A.   Users: Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall retain and make available for inspection and copying all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with best management practices established under
section
10-3I-2 of this chapter. Records shall include the date, exact place, method,
and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the
dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the Coordinator.
   B.   City: The City will maintain documentation of any monitoring waiver
issued pursuant to subsection 10-3H-5C of this chapter for a period of three
(3) years after the expiration of the waiver. The documentation will include
the reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in
its request for the waiver.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3K-4: PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANT USERS:
The Pretreatment Coordinator shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12)
months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall be
applicable to all significant industrial users and categorical industrial users
(or any other user that violates subsection C, D or H of this section) and
shall mean:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement as defined in article
F of this chapter;
   B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a 6-month period equals or exceeds the product
of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous
limits, as defined by article F of this chapter, multiplied by the applicable
criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement
as defined by article F of this chapter (daily maximum long-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the Coordinator has determined
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass
through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public;
   D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Coordinator's exercise
of his or her emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide, within forty five (45) calendar days after the due
date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, that the Coordinator determines will adversely affect the
operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

10-3L-1: NOTICE OF VIOLATION (NOV):
   A.   Issuance And Response: When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a
user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Pretreatment Coordinator may serve
upon that user a written NOV. The user shall respond to the NOV by the deadline
defined therein (usually within 20 workdays of issuance). The user's response
shall provide an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction of the cause of the violation and prevention of future violations
and shall include specific required actions. The response in no way relieves
the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the NOV.
   B.   Pretreatment Review: The Coordinator may initiate a pretreatment review
("pretreatment review") for any violation issued under subsection
10-3J-2B of this chapter, but will most likely initiate the process for the
first violation of any individual parameter. Once the need for a pretreatment
review has been identified, the Coordinator shall send the authorized
representative of the user the date that the pretreatment review meeting is
scheduled, normally within thirty (30) calendar days of the determination that
a pretreatment review is required.
   C.   Compliance Directive: After such pretreatment review meeting, the City
may issue a compliance directive stating that the user is in a “corrective
action” status. A plan for correction and compliance schedule illustrating
milestones may be issued by the City to the user. The plan for correction and
compliance schedule may become part of the user’s wastewater discharge permit.
The user shall meet the wastewater discharge permit pretreatment standards and
requirements at all times. The plan for correction, compliance schedule and
revised wastewater discharge permit do not relieve the user of meeting the
wastewater discharge permit limits or requirements of this chapter. The user
shall take whatever actions are necessary to meet the wastewater discharge
permit limits and conditions.
   D.   Continued Sampling: The City may continue to sample the wastewater of
the user and determine the user's progress towards meeting milestones as needed
to determine if the user is complying with the conditions of the plan of
action, compliance schedule and/or wastewater discharge permit. In the event
the City detects and documents any violation, an NOV shall be issued to the
user.
   E.   NOV For Each Violation: An NOV shall be issued for each identified
violation of the plan of action, compliance schedule, and wastewater discharge
permit conditions.
   F.   Termination Of Corrective Action Status: When the user has met the
conditions of the plan of action, compliance schedule, and permit, the City may
notify the user in writing that the conditions have been satisfied and they are
no longer under a “corrective action” status.
   G.   Other Actions Authorized: Issuance of a notice of violation shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3L-2: COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS:
The Coordinator may enter into compliance agreements, (i.e., “consent orders”,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance). Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
10-3L-4 and
10-3L-5 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3L-3: SHOW CAUSE ORDER:
The Coordinator may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear for a
hearing before representatives of the City and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken against the user. Notice of such hearing
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the
proposed enforcement action to be taken, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken against the user. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally
or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10)
workdays prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3L-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
   A.   When the Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Coordinator may issue an order to the user directing that the user comply with
this chapter, the wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement within a specified time.
   B.   If the user does not comply within the time provided, sanitary sewer
service may be discontinued by the City. Compliance orders may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or related appurtenances, additional
self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the POTW.
   C.   A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation.
   D.   Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3L-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
   A.   When the Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Coordinator may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge of wastewater.
   B.   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3L-6: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
   A.   The Coordinator may immediately suspend a user's discharge of
wastewater, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge of wastewater which
reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The Coordinator may also immediately
suspend a user’s discharge of wastewater, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
   B.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Coordinator may
take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance,
disconnection or blocking of the building sewer connection, to prevent, or
minimize damage to, the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Coordinator may allow the user to recommence its discharge
when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Coordinator that the
period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
section
10-3L-7 of this article are initiated against the user.
   C.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge of
wastewater presenting imminent endangerment as identified by the Coordinator
shall submit a detailed written statement, signed by the authorized
representative of the user, describing the causes of the harmful contribution
and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Coordinator
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section
10-3L-3 or 10-3L-7 of this chapter.
   D.   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3L-7: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
   A.   In addition to the provisions in section
10-3L-6 of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to termination of its wastewater discharge:
      1.   Violation of one or more wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      2.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      3.   Failure to report substantial changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      4.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      5.   Violation of one or more of the pretreatment standards in article F
of this chapter.
   B.   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
of wastewater and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section
10-3L-3 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the Coordinator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.

(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3M-2: RECOVERY OF COSTS INCURRED:
   A.   Generally: Any person or user violating any of the provisions of this
chapter, or who causes damage to or impairs the POTW is liable to the City for
all expenses, costs, losses and damages caused directly or indirectly by such
violation. The City may invoice the costs and expenses, including, but not
limited to, sampling and analyses associated with the investigation, costs and
expenses of mitigating impact to the POTW, costs and expenses of preparing the
administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders; investigative
and/or correction actions, and review of response(s) from the user. The City
shall invoice the user for the costs and expenses incurred by the City for any
and all cleaning, repair, replacement or other investigative and/or corrective
action(s) as a response to the violation. Any user that does not pay to the
City all such assessed costs and expenses shall constitute a violation of this
chapter enforceable under the provisions of article L of this chapter.
   B.   Food Service Establishments (FSEs):
      1.   Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee:
         a.   An FSE that operates without a grease interceptor may be required
to pay an annual grease disposal mitigation fee to equitably cover the costs of
increased maintenance of the POTW as a result of the FSE's inability to
adequately remove FOG from its wastewater discharge. This subsection B1a shall
not be interpreted to allow the new construction of an FSE, or existing FSE
undergoing remodeling, to operate without an approved grease interceptor.
         b.   The grease disposal mitigation fee is be based on the estimated
annual increased cost of maintaining the sewer system for inspection and
removal of FOG and other viscous or solidifying agents attributable to the FSE
resulting from the lack of a grease interceptor or in the case a grease
interceptor or alternate grease control device exists but has been determined
to be inadequate.
      2.   Sewer System Overflows; Public Nuisance; Abatement And Cleanup
Costs: Notwithstanding the waiver of grease interceptor installation for
existing FSE established in section
10-3D-5 of this chapter, an FSE found to have contributed to a sewer blockage,
sewer system overflow (SSO) or any public sewer interference resulting from the
discharge of wastewater or waste containing FOG may be subject to costs and
expenses incurred by the City. SSOs cause threats and injuries to public
health, safety, and welfare of life and property and are hereby declared public
nuisances. Building sewer failures and SSOs caused by FSE alone or collectively
are the responsibility of the private property owner or FSE, and the individual
(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE. If the City must act
immediately to contain and clean up an SSO caused by blockage of a building
sewer or public sewer, or at the request of the property owner or operator of
the FSE, or because of the failure of the property owner or FSE to abate the
condition causing immediate threat of injury to the health, safety, welfare, or
property of the public, the City's costs and expenses of such abatement shall
be entirely borne by the property owner or operator of the FSE, and the
individual(s) as a responsible officer or owner of the FSE(s), and shall
constitute a debt to the City and become due and payable upon the City's
request for reimbursement of such costs and expenses.
   C.   Lien Provisions:
      1.   Notice Of Lien:
         a.   If any person refuses to remedy a violation of the provisions of
this section and said violation is remedied by the City, a notice of lien for
the cost and expenses incurred shall be recorded in the following manner: The
City, or the person performing the service by authority of the City, may file
notice of lien in the Office of the County Recorder of Deeds.
         b.   The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting
forth:
            (1)   A description of the real estate involved sufficient for
identification;
            (2)   An amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred
or payable for the service; and
            (3)   The date or dates when the expense was incurred.
         c.   The notice of lien shall be filed within sixty (60) days after
the cost and expense is incurred.
      2.   Release Of Lien: If payment of the cost and expense is made after
notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the City, and the
release filed in the same manner as the notice of lien.

10-3M-3: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Coordinator may fine such user in an
amount not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). Such fines shall be
assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during
the period of violation.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013; amd. 2019 Code)
   B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after fifteen (15) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance. If the charges for such services are not paid within forty five (45)
days after the rendition of the bill for such services, such services shall be
discontinued without further notice and shall not be reinstated until all
claims are settled. A one hundred dollar ($100.00) disconnect and reconnect fee
shall be applied to the unpaid balance. A lien against the user’s property
shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
   C.   Users desiring reconsideration of such fines must file a written
request for the Coordinator to reconsider the fine along with full payment of
the fine amount within thirty (30) calendar days of being notified of the fine.
Where a request has merit, the Coordinator may convene a hearing on the matter.
In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user.
   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3M-4: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Attorney
may petition the Circuit Court of Iroquois County for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Coordinator
may also seek such environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3M-5: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
chapter, an individual or general wastewater discharge permit, or order issued

the City for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
   B.   The Coordinator may recover costs, including, but not limited to,
filing fees, witness fees, attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.
   C.   In determining the amount of fines and/or civil liability, the court or
judicial administrator shall take into account all relevant circumstances,
including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through
the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of
the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
   D.   Issuing a notice of local ordinance violation or the filing of a suit
for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against a user.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3M-6: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided in this article are not exclusive. The Coordinator may
take any or all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the City’s enforcement response plan. However, the Coordinator may take
other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the
Coordinator is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.

ARTICLE O: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
Section
10-3O-1: Upsets
10-3O-2: Prohibited Discharge Standards
10-3O-3: Bypasses
10-3O-1: UPSETS:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An "upset" does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An UPSET shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection C of this section are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workerlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the Pretreatment
Coordinator within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written report must be provided within
five (5) workdays):
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3O-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsections
10-3F-2A1 and A2 of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in subsection
10-3F-2A3 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference or that either:
   A.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or
interference; or
   B.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 2408, 11-26-2013)
10-3O-3: BYPASSES:
   A.   Definitions: For the purposes of this section, the following words and
terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection:
   BYPASS: The intentional diversion of wastewater from any portion of a user's
treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the
treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur
in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.
   B.   Bypasses Permitted: A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provisions of subsections C and D of this section.
   C.   Notice Of Bypass:
      1.   Anticipated: If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Coordinator at least ten (10) workdays before
the date of the bypass, if possible.
      2.   Unanticipated: A user shall submit oral notice to the Coordinator of
an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) workdays of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Coordinator may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty four (24) hours.
   D.   City Actions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Coordinator may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed, in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment, to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The Coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass after considering
its adverse effects, if the Coordinator determines that it will meet the three
(3) conditions listed in subsection D1 of this section.

10-2-2 of this title (see also subsections
10-4-2B and 10-4-3B of this title). The City may issue default rates for
defined classes of users. The basic user rate shall be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having a 5-day, twenty
degree Celsius (20°C) BOD of two hundred one milligrams per liter (201 mg/L)
and an SS concentration of two hundred thirty nine milligrams per liter (239
mg/L) (see also subsections
10-2-1C and 10-4A-1C1 of this title).
   C.   For users that cannot be defined in a default class, the surcharge rate
is based on the following three (3) components: volume discharged, surcharged
BOD, and surcharged TSS. The Pretreatment Coordinator may choose to not bill
users for surchargeable discharges if the Coordinator estimates that issuing
the surcharge would be cost prohibitive or have minimal benefit.

method of collection as herein provided or as provided by laws, the City may
turn delinquent users over to collection agencies. Any user being turned over
to such an agency for collection shall first be sent a notice of the City
intent to do so. Any outstanding water invoices will also be added to the sewer
use charges being turned over to the collection agency. The City may impose a
collection agent turnover fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) on any customer
so turned over to such an agency, If so, the notice must state to the customer
the amount of such fee.

description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill and a notice
that the City claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges
subsequent to the period covered by the bill.
         b.   If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises
and the City Secretary has notice of this condition, a notice shall be mailed
to the owner of the premises, if known to the Secretary, whenever such bill
remains unpaid for one hundred five (105) calendar days after it has been
issued.
         c.   The failure of the City Secretary to record such lien or to mail
such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect
the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned in subsection E2
of this section.
      2.   Foreclosure Of Lien: Property subject to lien for unpaid charges
under this chapter shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds
of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting the costs, as
is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by
bill in equity in the name of the City. The City Attorney is hereby authorized
and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the City of Watseka
in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against the property for
which the bill has remained unpaid one hundred five (105) calendar days in the

10-4A-1:   BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the City shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance plus replacement, applicable surcharges and local
capital cost charge composed of a debt service charge and a capital improvement
charge.
   A.   Debt Service Charge: The debt service charge is computed by
apportioning the annual debt service on a cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons
basis.
   B.   Capital Improvement Charge: The capital improvement charge is levied on
all users to provide for capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of
the sewage treatment works. The capital improvement is computed by apportioning
the annual amount to be accrued as a cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons or
as a fixed charge per month.
   C.   Basic User Charge:
      1.   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
domestic concentrations (see also subsections
10-2-1C and
10-3P-1B of this title):
         a.   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°) biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) of two hundred one milligrams per liter (201 mg/L)
         b.   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred thirty nine
milligrams per liter (239 mg/L).
      2.   It shall consist of operation and maintenance replacement and shall
be computed as follows:
         a.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated.
         b.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
         c.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance, and replacement
(OM&R) costs to each user class by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
         d.   Proportion the estimated OM&R costs to wastewater facility
categories by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
         e.   Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage
strength.
         f.   Compute surcharge costs per pound per one thousand (1,000)
gallons in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
   D.   Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed
the normal domestic concentrations of BOD (201 mg/L) and SS (239 mg/L). The
surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or
sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the two hundred one milligrams per
liter (201 mg/L) and two hundred thirty nine milligrams per liter (239 mg/L)
concentration for BOD and SS respectively. Subsection
10-4A-4A of this article specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
(1980 Code page 216 art. I § 1)
10-4A-2:   MEASUREMENT OF FLOW:
The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges shall
be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of one
thousand (1,000) gallons.
   A.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by
the City for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these
other sources.
   B.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by
the City if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water
consumption records.
   C.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the City.
(1980 Code page 217 art. I § 2)

charges of debt service of sixty five cents ($0.65) per one thousand (1,000)
gallons, capital improvement charge of ninety cents ($0.90) per one thousand
(1,000) gallons, and eighty five cents ($0.85) for operation, maintenance and
replacement for a total of two dollars forty cents ($2.40) per one thousand
(1,000) gallons.
      2.   a.    All nonmetered residential users of the wastewater facilities
shall pay a minimum flat rate charge of seven dollars fifty cents ($7.50) per

herein set forth.
(1980 Code § 36-83)
12-3C-8: FACTORS AND MITIGATION:
   A.   No special use permit shall be granted pursuant unless the applicant
shall establish that:   
      1.   Code And Plan Purposes: The proposed use and development will be in
harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this title was enacted
and for which the regulations of the district in question were established.
      2.   No Undue Adverse Impact: The proposed use and development will not
have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the
character of the area, or the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      3.   No Interference With Surrounding Development. The proposed use and
development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to dominate
the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the use and development of
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations.
      4.   Adequate Public Facilities: The proposed use and development will be
served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as streets,
public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection, refuse
disposal, parks, libraries, and schools, or the applicant will provide
adequately for such services.
      5.   No Traffic Congestion: The proposed use and development will not
cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through
streets.
      6.   No-Destruction Of Significant Features: The proposed use and
development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural,
scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
      7.   Compliance With Standards: The proposed use and development complies
with all standards imposed on that use and any district where it is a permitted
use.
   B.   In determining whether the applicant’s evidence establishes that the
foregoing standards have been met, the Zoning Commission shall consider:
      1.   Public Benefit: Whether and to what extent, the proposed use and
development at the particular location requested is necessary or desirable to
provide a service or a facility that is in the interest of the public
convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood
or community.
      2.   Alternative Locations: Whether and to what extent, such public goals
can be met by the location of the proposed use and development at some other
site or in some other area that may be more appropriate than the proposed site.
      3.   Mitigation Of Adverse Impacts: Whether and to what extent, all steps
possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed use
and development on the immediate vicinity through building design, site design,
landscaping, and screening.
   C.   The Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Council may impose
such conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character,
location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes
and objectives of this title upon the premises benefited by a special use
permit as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse
effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject
property or upon public facilities and services; provided, however, that such
conditions shall not be used as a device to grant a permit for a special use
that is intended to be temporary in nature. Such conditions shall be expressly
set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Violation of any such
condition or limitation shall be a violation of this title and shall constitute
grounds for revocation of the special use permit.
   D.   Whenever any special use permit granted pursuant to this section is
made subject to conditions or limitations to be met by the applicant, the
applicant shall, upon meeting such conditions, file an affidavit with the
Building Official so stating. Such affidavit shall be accompanied by a
nonrefundable fee, to be fixed in each case by the Building Official, to
recover the City’s actual direct cost of an inspection to verify that such
conditions and limitations have been met.
   E.   The grant of a special use permit shall not authorize the establishment
or extension of any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize
the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits or
approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the City.
   F.   Subject to an extension of time granted by the Building Official, no
special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one (1) year unless
a building permit is issued and construction has actually begun within that
period, and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a
Certificate of Occupancy is issued and a use commenced within that period.
   G.   A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular
use for which it was issued, and such permit shall automatically expire and
cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be
discontinued for a period of six (6) consecutive months or more.
   H.   Except when otherwise provided in the ordinance granting a special use
permit, a special use permit shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the
benefit of, the use and property in question rather than the owner or operator
of such use or property.
   I.   A special use permit may be amended, varied, or altered only pursuant
to the procedures and subject to the standards and limitations provided in this
section for its original approval.

foundation and design of the CSEF is within accepted professional standards,
given local soil and climate conditions.
   B.   A CSEF shall be designed, installed and conform to applicable industry
standards, including those of the American National Standards Institute
(“ANSI").
   C.   A CSEF and the property on which it is located shall be maintained in
compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal technical codes and
regulatory standards, as amended.
   D.   A CSEF shall conform to the performance standards applicable in the
zoning district in which they are located.
   E.   Power and communication lines running between banks of solar panels and
to electric substations or interconnections with buildings within the perimeter
of the solar energy development shall be buried according to the National
Electric Code (NEC) in effect at the time of application. All power and
communication lines outside the fenced perimeter of the solar energy
development shall be buried no less than six feet (6'). During the installation
and before wires and lines are covered there will be an inspection for
compliance by the City. Exemptions or variances may be granted by the City
Council in instances where shallow bedrock, water courses, or other elements of
natural landscape interfere with the ability to bury lines. All power and
communication lines shall be geo-located. J.U.L.I.E. shall be contacted before
commencing digging excavations. All electrical components of the CSEF shall
conform to the applicable local, state, and national codes, and relevant
national and international standards.
   F.   All drainage tiles shall be repaired or restored to same or better
condition as to when the project began. There will be an inspection for
compliance by an independent inspector chosen and hired by the City and
invoiced and by the City to the facility owner or operator. Local drainage
districts shall be contacted prior to beginning development to locate drainage
district tiles.
   G.   Equipment and structures shall not exceed twenty feet (20') in height
when ground mounted. Excluded from this height requirement, however, are
electric transmission lines and utility poles.
   H.   An appropriate warning sign shall be provided at the entrance to the
facility and along the perimeter to the solar farm project. The sign at the
entrance to the facility shall include the facilities 911 address and a twenty-
four (24)-hour emergency contact number. A 911-compliant visible warning sign
concerning voltage must be placed at all CSEF(s), including the base of all
pad-mounted transformers, and supporting facilities.
      Warning signs identifying underground wire locations shall be placed at
all road crossings, creek, waterway, and ditch crossings, and at the base of
CSEF(s) and supporting facilities. All underground wire locations shall be GPS
mapped and given to the Building Official.
   I.   The regulations regarding the siting of a CSEF, with setback distances
measured from the nearest edge of any component of the facility, are as
follows:
      1.   One hundred fifty feet (150') from the nearest point on the outside
wall of the structure, measured from the nearest edge of any component of the
facility from occupied community building and dwellings on nonparticipating
properties.
      2.   Zero feet (0') from boundary lines of participating property.
      3.   Fifty feet (50') from the nearest edge of a public road rights-of-
way.
      4.   Fifty feet (50') to the nearest point on the property line of a
nonparticipating property.
   J.   The equipment and structures of the CSEF shall be fully enclosed and
secured by a chain-link or equivalent fence with a minimum height of eight feet
(8') and not more than twenty feet (20') in height. Knox boxes and keys shall
be provided at locked entrances for emergency personnel access. The entirety of
the CSEF shall be enclosed with a living buffer of evergreen trees that must be
planted and maintained prior to construction and will meet or exceed the height
of the solar panels and all facilities equipment, including fencing.
Additionally, the applicant/owner must comply with any screening requirements
requested by the Building Official and consistent with state law and the
provisions hereof. An alternative buffer may also be considered. Earth be1ms or
other topographical features and existing wooded areas may be accepted in lieu
or in combination of the above requirements if they conceal the use from public
view and are maintained. The landscape plan shall also incorporate native
grasses, flowers and plants which will provide wildlife and pollinator habitat,
soil erosion protection and/or aid in strengthening the soil structure. This
shall not be part of the evergreen screen but shall be for all other areas of
the solar farm that will not interfere with the solar arrays.
   K.   If lighting is provided at the site, lighting shall be shielded and
downcast such that the light does not spill onto the adjacent parcel or
residence.
   L.   Noise levels measured at the property line shall not exceed fifty (50)
decibels when located adjacent to an existing residence or residential
district.
   M.   Individual arrays/solar panels shall be designed and located in order
to prevent glare toward any inhabited buildings on adjacent properties as well
as adjacent street rights-of-way.
   N.   CSEF projects shall conform with site runoff storage requirements,
unless the solar panels are "disconnected." Solar panels will be considered
"disconnected" and therefore pervious, if the following criteria are met:
      1.   Pavement, gravel, bare ground, or impervious surfaces are prohibited
below panels or in spacer sections between rows of panels unless specifically
approved by the Village Engineer. All such areas shall be seeded with native
grass or other acceptable alternative. Landscaping shall be well-maintained and
annually seeded, as appropriate, to prevent soil compaction or bare ground
conditions. The growth of vegetation within the perimeter of CSEF assemblage
shall not exceed ten (1 0") inches in height. Tire rutting from maintenance or
other vehicles in spacer sections shall be monitored annually and regraded and
seeded, as appropriate, to mitigate soil erosion and storm water run-off
      2.   The total proposed impervious area on the surface of the ground must
be less than twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet.
      3.   The open space between panels must be equal to or greater than the
width of the row of panels. The runoff must sheet flow onto and across the
vegetated area to maintain the disconnection. Sheet flow is optimal on sites
with gradual slopes less than five percent (<5%). Level spreaders, terraces, or
berms may be used to maintain sheet flow conditions if the average slope is
steeper than five percent (5%) and less than ten percent (<10%). Installations
on slopes greater than ten percent (>10%) will require a detailed engineering
study to demonstrate the safe and non-erosive conveyance of runoff to the
property line or downstream storm water management practice.
   O.   The applicant, facility owner or operator shall submit to the local
fire department(s) with jurisdiction over the site, a copy of the existing and
proposed site plans. Upon request by the local fire department, the facility
owner or operator shall cooperate with the local fire department to develop the
fire department's emergency response plan. In addition, at no cost to the local
fire department, the facility owner or operator shall provide to the local fire
department any and all specialized and necessary new rescue or retrieval
equipment occasioned by the use of the particular solar panels being used at
the project (i.e., gurney, body harnesses, etc.). In addition, the facility
owner or operator shall have the responsibility to update, at no cost to the
local fire department, such equipment in possession of the local fire
department as any updates are presented to the facility owner or operator in
the normal course of business. Failure to comply shall be deemed a default
resulting in an immediate shutdown of the CSEF(s). Nothing herein shall
alleviate the need to comply with all other applicable fire laws and
regulations.
   P.   Battery storage systems for any CSEF shall comply with NFPA 855.
(Ord. 2710, 3-26-2024)
12-16-6: INSPECTIONS:

(12) consecutive months. Decommissioning shall be completed within six (6)
months. Decommissioning will not be required in the event a CSEF cannot be used
for reasons outside of the control of the facility owner or operator and it is
using commercially reasonable means to put the CSEF back in use as
expeditiously as is reasonably possible.
   B.   Prior to the issuance of building permits, financial assurances for
compliance with the decommissioning plan shall be made to the City in a minimum
amount equal to two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per acre. Additional financial
assurance shall be supplied, if necessary, to bring the total amount of
security to an amount equaling the City engineer's estimate for
decommissioning. All cash security shall be paid into an escrow account
acceptable to and controlled by the City. Said escrow shall be released when
the CSEF is decommissioned in accordance with the plan.
   C.   The City shall have the authority to decommission the site with the
security held in the event the facility owner or operator fails to do comply
with the decommissioning plan. In the event that escrow funds are not
sufficient to cover the cost of decommissioning, the shortfall shall be due and
owing to the City by the landowner.
   D.   A facility owner or operator shall submit an updated decommissioning
plan, including updating the escrow amount, to the Building Official for his
approval every three (3) years.
(Ord. 2710, 3-26-2024)

with an approved preliminary plat of subdivision site plan or preliminary site
plan.
      4.   The plat or site plan does not conform to this title, the
Comprehensive Plan, the Official Map, the flood control ordinance of the City,
City ordinances, or established planning policies of the City.
      5.   The provisions for vehicular loading, unloading, parking or
circulation on the parcel or onto adjacent public rights-of-way will create
hazards to safety or will cause significant burdens on transportation
facilities that could be avoided by modification of the plan.
      6.   The vehicular and pedestrian traffic circulation system creates
hazards to safety which could be avoided by modification of the plan.
      7.   The proposed plan unnecessarily and in specified particulars
destroys, damages, or detrimentally alters significant natural, topographic or

streets, to topographical conditions and natural terrain features such as
streams and existing tree growth, to public convenience and safety, and in
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by such streets.
It is the intent that the street system, whether public or private, encourage
safe and efficient traffic flow (B-40 vehicle with a turning radius of 60
feet), as well as provide safe vehicular storage space for stopping and turning
movements so as to not conflict at intersecting streets or driveway entrances.

proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on
the Official Map.
      2.   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches and
shopping centers, to population densities and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
      3.   Minor streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to
the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets
necessary to provide convenient, safe access to property.
      4.   The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not necessarily
be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets shall be encouraged where
such use will result in a more desirable layout. The use of cul-de-sacs and u-
shaped streets is not encouraged.
      5.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
parcel to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Plan Commission, extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
site plan with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development
of adjacent parcels.
      6.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys and truck loading and
maneuvering areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various
types of traffic.
      7.   Dual access shall be provided in any subdivision site plan,
beginning with the initial construction, and shall be maintained in suitable
condition for passage of private and emergency vehicles.
   C.   Where a subdivision site plan borders on or contains a railroad or
highway, the Plan Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and
on each side of such railroad or highway, at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land, for park purposes in residential
districts or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts.
Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separations.
   D.   Where a subdivision site plan abuts or contains an existing or proposed
highway or major thoroughfare, as shown on the Comprehensive Plan or Official
Map (see title 1, chapter 13 of this Code), the Plan Commission may require
marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a
nuances reservation, at least ten feet (10') wide, along the rear property
line; deep lots with rear service alleys; or such other treatment as may be
necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
   E.   1. Street right-of-way widths shall be as specified in section
13-8-2 of this title.
      2.   Reserve strips controlling access to public utilities or streets
shall be prohibited.
      3.   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point by more than ten degrees (10°), they shall be connected by a curve with a
radius adequate to ensure clear sight distances.
   F.   Street grades shall provide proper relation between the street and the
first floor elevation of the houses or buildings to permit convenient and
economical access to and drainage of the lots. Driveway slopes shall be between
two percent (2%) and eight percent (8%).
   G.   Street gradients shall be as specified in section
13-8-2 of this title.

   G.   Separation From Sewers: The water main pipe shall be laid at least ten
feet (10') horizontally distant from any existing or proposed sewer pipe. If
the water main must cross a sewer pipe, the bottom of the water main pipe must
be laid at least eighteen inches (18") above the top of the sewer pipe. If
neither of these conditions can be met, other protective methods, as described
and illustrated in the “Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main
Construction in Illinois”, shall be followed.
   H.   Construction Requirements:
      1.   Excavation:
         a.   The trench shall be excavated so that the water main shall have a
minimum of five feet (5') of cover.
         b.   The trench shall be excavated so that a minimum of six inches
(6") of CA-7 stone be placed as bedding material. The pipe shall then be
covered with a minimum of six inches (6") of the same stone.
         c.   Where a firm foundation is not found to exist for the bottom of
the trench at the required depth due to soft, spongy, or other unsuitable soil,
such unsuitable soil shall be removed for the full width of the trench and
replaced with well-compacted CA-7 material or an equal substitute if such
compacted material proves unsatisfactory. Where rock in either ledge or boulder
formation is encountered, it shall be removed below grade and replaced with a
well-compacted cushion of CA-7 material having a thickness under the pipe of
not less than eight inches (8").
      2.   Safety: The contractor shall be responsible for providing a
competent individual on-site during all trenching operations to ensure that all
OSHA and other applicable safety standards are met by construction means and
methods.
      3.   Laying Water Main:
         a.   The contractor shall keep the trench free from water while the
water main is being placed and the pipe joint has been sealed to the
satisfaction of the Subdivision Administrator.
         b.   Adequate provision shall be made for the safety, storage, and
protection of all water pipe prior to actual installation in the trench. Care
shall be taken to prevent damage to the pipe castings, both inside and out.
Provisions shall be made to keep the inside of the pipe clean throughout its
storage period and to keep mud and other debris from being deposited therein.
All pipe shall be thoroughly cleaned on the inside before laying of the pipe.
Proper equipment shall be used for the safe handling, conveying, and laying of
the pipe. All pipe shall be carefully lowered into the trench, piece by piece,
in such manner as to prevent damage to water main materials and protective
coatings and linings. Under no circumstances shall water main materials be
dropped or dumped into the trench.
         c.   In making joints, all portions of the joining materials and the
socket and spigot ends of the joining pipe shall be wiped clean of all foreign
materials. The actual assembly of the jointing shall be in accordance with the
manufacturer's installation instructions and as directed by the Subdivision
Administrator. During construction, until jointing operations are complete, the
open ends of all pipes shall be at all times protected and sealed with
temporary watertight plugs.
         d.   Polyurethane wrapping of the water main will be required only in
areas where unsuitable soils are found to exist as determined by the
Subdivision Administrator.
      4.   Pipe Cutting:
         a.   The cutting of pipe for inserting valves, fittings, or closure
pieces shall be done in a neat and workerlike manner without damage to the
cement lining and so as to leave a smooth end at right angles to the axis of
the pipe.
         b.   Flame cutting of the pipe by means of an oxyacetylene torch shall
not be allowed.
         c.   All cut-in connections for greater than a two inch (2")
connection shall be made by cast iron sleeve or City-approved equal.
      5.   Trench:
         a.   The trench bottom shall be flat and shall provide full bearing of
the length of the pipe.
         b.   Thrust blocks shall be used to prevent movement at all tees,
caps, valves, and hydrants.
         c.   Backfilling of the trench shall be accomplished by careful
replacement of the excavated material after the pipe and the bedding material
(if applicable) have been installed. Any pipe installed under an existing or
proposed street pavement, or within two feet (2') of an existing or proposed
pavement edge, curb and gutter, bike trail or sidewalk shall be backfilled to
the top of the trench with CA-7 material compacted in lifts not exceeding
twelve inches (12") and the final twelve inches (12") with compacted CA-
6 material.
      6.   Fire Hydrant:
         a.   Fire hydrants shall be placed as specified herein. There shall be
no obstructions within four feet (4') of the fire hydrant. All nozzles shall
stand plumb, their steamer nozzle pointing normal to the road. They shall
conform to the established grade, with nozzles at eighteen inches (18") above
the finished grade.
         b.   A drainage pit two feet (2') in diameter shall be excavated
around each hydrant and filled completely with three-fourths inch (3/4") washed
gravel under and around the bowl of the drain opening. No hydrant drainage pit
shall be connected to a sewer.
      7.   Water Main Installation: During water main installation, to make a
closure between two (2) pipe ends, or between a pipe end fittings, or between a
pipe end and valve, short lengths shall be used with proper connections or
couplings. Repair sleeves shall not be used to make closures during new
construction.
      8.   Dewatering: Where water is encountered in the trench, it shall be
removed during pipe laying and jointing operations. Trench water shall not be
allowed to enter the pipe at anytime.
      9.   Connections To Existing Mains: All connections to the City water
distribution system shall be made under full water service pressure, unless
otherwise approved by the Subdivision Administrator at locations approved by
the Subdivision Administrator.
   I.   Pressure Test:
      1.   As part of the construction, the water mains shall be pressure
tested in accordance with this appendix. All testing shall be performed before
curb and gutter or other permanent type surface improvement work begins. The
Subdivision Administrator shall be notified at least twenty four (24) hours
before the test. The filling of the water main shall be at a rate set by the
City, with all hydrants and whips in the open position and slowly closed in the
order in which water appears. A form documenting the test procedure and results
shall be signed by the contractor and the representative for the City
witnessing the test,
      2.   All newly laid pipe shall be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure of
one hundred fifty (150) pounds per square inch, in accordance with AWWA
Standard C-600-93, latest edition, section 4: Hydrostatic Testing. Allowable
leakage, measured in gph (gallons per hour) per one thousand feet (1,000') of
pipeline, as specified in Table 6A of the AWWA Standard C-600-93, shall apply.
Duration of each pressure test shall be for a period of not less than two (2)
hours. Each valved section of pipe shall be filled with water, and the
specified test pressure shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the
pipe. Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled
from the pipe. All leaks shall be repaired until tight. Any cracked or
defective pipes, fittings, valves or hydrants discovered in consequence of this
pressure test shall be removed and replaced and the test repeated until
satisfactory results are obtained.
      3.   All testing shall be performed before the installation of service
lines.
   J.   Preliminary Flushing: Prior to chlorination, the main shall be flushed
as thoroughly as possible with the water pressure and outlets available. The
Subdivision Administrator shall be notified before any water is drawn from City
mains. Flushing shall be done after the pressure test is made. Because such
flushing removes only the lighter solids, it cannot be relied upon to remove
heavy material allowed to get into the main during laying. If no hydrant is
installed at the end of the main, a tap should be provided large enough to
affect a velocity in the main of at least two and one-half feet (21/2') per
second.
   K.   Disinfection:
      1.   The preferred point of application of the chlorinating agent shall
be at the beginning of the pipeline extension (or any valved section of it) and
through a corporation stop in the top of the newly laid pipe. The injector for
delivering the chlorine gas into the pipe should be supplied from a tap on the
pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow into the pipeline
extension.
      2.   Water from the existing distribution system or any other source of
supply shall be controlled so as to flow slowly into the newly laid pipeline
during the application of chlorine gas. The rate of chlorine mixture flow shall
be in such proportion to the rate of water entering the pipe that the chlorine
dose applied to the water entering the newly laid pipe shall be at least fifty
(50) ppm, or enough to meet the requirements during the retention period. This
may require as much as one hundred (100) ppm of chlorine in the water left in
the line after chlorination.
      3.   Valves shall be manipulated so that the strong chlorine solution in
the line being treated shall not flow back into the line supplying the water.
The pipe section being chlorinated shall be kept at a lower pressure than the
water system pressure.
      4.   Treated water shall be retained in the pipe long enough to destroy
all spore-forming bacteria. This retention period shall be at least twenty four
(24) hours. After the chlorine-treated water has been retained for the required
time, the chlorine residual at the pipe extremities and at other representative
points shall be at least ten (10) ppm.
      5.   In the process of chlorinating newly laid pipe, all valves or other
appurtenances shall be operated while the pipeline is filled with the
chlorinating agent.
      6.   Water mains shall be disinfected and tested according to the
requirements of the “Standards for Disinfecting Water Mains”, AWWA C-601, as
amended from time to time, and as required by this appendix. All disinfection,
as required by this appendix, shall be performed by an independent firm
exhibiting experience in the methods and techniques of this operation, and
shall be approved by the Subdivision Administrator. The firm shall be bonded
and insured and have proof of both in the firm's vehicle (as well as on file
with the City). The insurance shall include the City of Watseka as additionally
insured and must include coverage for the handling and transporting of chlorine
gas. Furthermore, the firm must comply with all State and Federal regulations
regarding the handling and transporting of chlorine gas. City personnel must be
present during any chlorination work (including the collection of samples). The
Subdivision Administrator is to receive a forty eight (48) hour notification
prior to any disinfection work.
      7.   Disinfecting shall be done by the continuous feed method.
      8.   Only authorized City employees shall operate water system valves.
      9.   A minimum of two (2) people are required for chlorinating
procedures, one to monitor the chlorine at the cylinder and one to monitor the
chlorine at the sample (whip) locations.
      10.   Samples shall only be taken from copper “whips” (not hydrants).
      11.   All chlorine cylinders shall be secured to the vehicle in a
vertical position.
      12.   Under no circumstances shall any heat be applied directly to the
chlorine cylinder.
      13.   A yoke adaptor for connection to the chlorine cylinder shall be
used.
      14.   Clear neoprene tubing shall be used for the dissemination of the
chlorine.
      15.   A needle valve shall be used for the accurate control of the
chlorine.
      16.   A back-pressure gauge and plastic check valve shall be used.
      17.   The chlorine assembly shall not use any “quick-connects” or clamps;
only threaded fittings.
      18.   The firm performing the chlorinating shall have an up-to-date
certified air pack in their vehicle.
      19.   All building service lines (4 inches in diameter or larger) shall
be chlorinated/disinfected only after permanent fittings have been installed.
Removal of any such fitting may require the service line to be re-sampled or
re-chlorinated at the discretion of the City.
   L.   Final Flushing And Testing:
      1.   No disconnection from an existing or connection to a new water main
is to be performed until the new water main is tested and placed into service.
For replacement water mains, all work shall be performed prior to abandoning
the existing water main. In the event that an interruption of service is
required, the contractor shall notify all affected users, in writing, at least
twenty four (24) to forty eight (48) hours in advance.
      2.   Following chlorination, all treated water shall be thoroughly
flushed from the newly laid pipeline at its extremities until the replacement
water, throughout its length, shall, upon test, be approved as safe water by
the Subdivision Administrator. This quality of water delivered by the new main
should continue for a period of at least two (2) full days, as demonstrated by
laboratory examination of samples taken from a tap located and installed in
such a way as to prevent outside contamination. Samples should never be taken
from an unsterilized hose or from a fire hydrant because such samples seldom
meet current bacteriological standards.
      3.   After disinfecting and flushing, a minimum of two (2) water samples
shall be collected by the contractor on two (2) successive days, with notice
given, so that the collection may be witnessed by the City. Bacteriological
sampling and analyses of the samples shall be performed by a laboratory
approved by the Illinois Department of Public Health and the City. Should the
initial treatment result in an unsatisfactory bacteriological test, the
procedure shall be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. The
contractor or developer shall pay for the sampling and analyses. Results shall
be transmitted by the laboratory directly to the Subdivision Administrator.
Test results shall indicate the date the sample was made, the exact locations
at which the sample was taken, the firm submitting the sample, and the project
at which the sample was collected. Sufficient samples shall be collected in
order to ensure that the system is bacteriologically safe.
      4.   The City shall operate the valves, hydrants, and any other
appurtenances to flush the water main after the receipt of satisfactory water
samples. Any operation difficulties or deficiencies shall be noted and
submitted to the developer or contractor for repair.
      5.   All corporation stops used for testing and chlorination purposes
shall be removed and plugged with a tapered brass plug.
      6.   Fire flow testing will be performed by the Superintendent of Water.
      7.   Record drawings:
         a.   Prior to final acceptance of work, as-built drawings shall be
submitted to the City for review.
         b.   Upon City approval of as-built drawings, two (2) full-size (36
inch by 48 inch) copies (signed and sealed by a registered Illinois
professional engineer) shall be submitted to the City, along with an electronic
copy in accordance with current City requirements (see section
13-5-10 of this title).

The principal purpose of this title is to promote effective, equitable,
acceptable, and legal stormwater management measures by establishing reasonable
rules and regulations for development within the City. Other purposes of this
title include:
   A.   Managing and mitigating the effects of urbanization on stormwater
drainage throughout the City through planning, appropriate engineering
practices and proper maintenance.
   B.   Protecting from, and reducing the existing potential for, loss of human
life, health, safety and property from the hazards of flooding damages on a
watershed basis.
   C.   Preserving and enhancing the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions
and natural characteristics of watercourses and floodplains to protect water
quality, protect aquatic habitats, reduce flood damages, reduce soil erosion,
provide recreational and aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.
   D.   Controlling sediment and erosion in and from stormwater facilities,
developments, agricultural fields, and construction sites and reducing and
repairing stream bank erosion.
   E.   Requiring that planning for development provides for water resource
management, taking into account natural features such as vegetation, wildlife,
waterways, wetlands, and topography in order to reduce the probability that new
development will create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion.
   F.   Protecting environmentally sensitive areas from deterioration or
destruction by private or public actions.
   G.   Requiring appropriate and adequate provision for site runoff control,
especially when the land is developed with a large amount of impervious
surface.
   H.   Requiring the design and evaluation of each site's stormwater
management plan consistent with watershed capacities.
   I.   Encouraging the use of stormwater storage and infiltration of
stormwater in preference to stormwater conveyance.
   J.   Lessening the taxpayers’ burden for flood-related disasters, repairs to
flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief
operations.
   K.   Meeting the Illinois Department of Natural Resources-Office of Water
Resources floodway permitting requirements delineated in 615 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/18g (“An Act in Relation to the Regulation of the Rivers, Lakes, and
Streams of the State of Illinois”), as amended from time to time.
   L.   Making federally subsidized flood insurance available in the City by
fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
   M.   Complying with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified in title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
   N.   Restricting future development in the floodplain to facilities that
will not adversely affect the potential for flood damage.
   O.   Requiring regular, planned maintenance of stormwater management
facilities.
   P.   Allowing the use of simple technologies whenever appropriate and
realistic, but requiring the use of more sophisticated techniques when
necessary to ensure the adequacy of stormwater controls.

14-1-2: SCOPE:
This title applies to all development within the City, including that under the
control of any governmental entity, agency, or authority. When the City shall
undertake development in the regulatory floodway, or regulatory floodplain
where no regulatory floodway has been designated, it shall obtain a permit from
IDNR/OWR prior to issuance of a stormwater management permit. All units of
local government shall obtain stormwater management permits from the City for
all development projects within the corporate limits of the City.

(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-5-4: LETTERS OF CREDIT:
   A.   Letters of credit posted pursuant to sections
14-5-1,
14-5-2 and
14-5-3 of this chapter shall be in a form satisfactory to the Administrator.
   B.   Each letter of credit shall be from a lending institution:
      1.   Acceptable to the Administrator, as applicable;
      2.   Having capital resources of at least ten million dollars
($10,000,000.00), or such other amount acceptable to the Administrator; and
      3.   Insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
   C.   Each letter of credit shall, at a minimum, provide that:
      1.   It shall not be canceled without the prior written consent of the
Administrator; and shall not expire without written notification of the
Administrator at least forty five (45) days prior to expiration; and
      2.   It shall not require the consent of the developer prior to any draw
on it by the Administrator; and
      3.   If at any time it will expire within forty five (45) or any lesser
number of days, and if it has not been renewed and the renewal submitted to the
Administrator, and if any applicable obligation of the developer for which its
security remains uncompleted or is unsatisfactory, then the Administrator may,
without notice and without being required to take any further action of any
nature whatsoever, call and draw down the letter of credit and thereafter
either hold all proceeds as security for the satisfactory completion of all
such obligations or employ the proceeds to complete all such obligations and
reimburse the City for any and all costs and expenses, including legal fees and
administrative costs, incurred by the City, as the Administrator shall
determine.
   D.   If at any time the Administrator determines that the funds remaining in
the letter of credit are not, or may not be, sufficient to pay in full the
remaining unpaid cost of all stormwater facility construction or sediment and
erosion control measures, then, within ten (10) days following a demand by the
Administrator, the developer shall increase the amount of the letter of credit
to an amount determined by the Administrator to be sufficient to pay such
unpaid costs. Failure to so increase the amount of the security shall be
grounds for the Administrator to draw down the entire remaining balance of the
letter of credit.
   E.   If at any time the Administrator determines that the bank issuing the
letter of credit is without capital resources of at least ten million dollars
($10,000,000.00), is unable to meet any Federal or State requirement for
reserves, is insolvent, is in danger of becoming any of the foregoing, or is
otherwise in danger of being unable to honor such letter of credit at any time
during its term, or if the Administrator otherwise reasonably deems the bank to
be insecure, then the Administrator shall have the right to demand that the
developer provide a replacement letter of credit from a bank satisfactory to
the Administrator. Such replacement letter of credit shall be deposited with
the Administrator not later than ten (10) days following such demand. Upon such
deposit, the Administrator shall surrender the original letter of credit to the
developer.
   F.   If the developer fails or refuses to meet fully any of its obligations
under this title, then the Administrator may, in his or her discretion, draw on
and retain all or any of the funds remaining in the letter of credit. The
Administrator thereafter shall have the right to take any action he or she
deems reasonable and appropriate to mitigate the effects of such failure or
refusal, and to reimburse the Community from the proceeds of the letter of
credit for all of its costs and expenses, including legal fees and
administrative expenses, resulting from or incurred as a result of the
developer's failure or refusal to fully meet its obligations under this title.
If the funds remaining in the letter of credit are insufficient to repay fully
the Community for all such costs and expenses, and to maintain a cash reserve
equal to the required letter of credit during the entire time such letter of
credit should have been maintained by the developer, then the developer shall,
upon demand of the Administrator therefor, immediately deposit with the
Administrator such additional funds as the Administrator determines are
necessary to fully repay such costs and expenses and to establish such cash
reserve.

CHAPTER 6: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS
Section
14-6-1: Compliance With Certain Provisions
14-6-2: General Requirements
14-6-3: Site Runoff Requirements
14-6-4: Site Runoff Storage Requirements (Detention/Extended Detention)
14-6-5: Requirements For Agricultural Land Uses
14-6-1: COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN PROVISIONS:
   A.   All developments shall meet the requirements specified for general
stormwater development (section
14-6-2 of this chapter), site runoff (section
14-6-2 of this chapter), sediment and erosion control (chapter 7 of this
title), and performance security and maintenance (chapter 9 of this title).
   B.   1. All developments shall comply with the site runoff storage
requirements provided in section
14-6-4 of this chapter in which:
         a.   More than two (2) single-family structures or one multi-family
structure is to be constructed on a parcel or site more than one acre in size;
         b.   Nonresidential land use is to be constructed on a parcel or site
more than one acre in size;
         c.   Existing multi-family or nonresidential land uses on a site one
acre or more in size on which new development after the effective date hereof
in the aggregate exceeds twenty five thousand (25,000) square feet;
         d.   Roadway developments in rights-of-way under the ownership or
control of a unit of local government when the contiguous area of new roadway
construction (excluding previously paved areas) exceeds two (2) acres;
         e.   The developer of a commercial or industrial redevelopment may
request that a fee-in-lieu of detention be approved; provided, that all of the
following are demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the Administrator:
            (1)   The drainage plan will not increase existing flood damages;
and
            (2)   The drainage plan provides a net benefit in water quality
compared to the existing development.
      2.   The Administrator shall determine the appropriate fee to be
collected as defined in chapter 11 of this title, and his or her decision in
the matter shall be considered final.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-6-2: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Requirements Applicable To All Developments: No development shall:
      1.   Result in any new or additional expense to any person other than the
developer for flood protection; nor
      2.   Increase flood elevations or decrease flood conveyance capacity
upstream or downstream of the area under the ownership or control of the
developer. This requirement shall not prohibit the removal or reduction of
built obstructions to flow, such as increasing culvert capacity or lowering
roadway elevations; nor
      3.   Increase runoff rates (from the 10-year event up to the 100-year
event) to any downstream properties unless the developer can demonstrate that
the increased runoff rates can be safely conveyed via storm sewers, ditches (if
allowed), or overland flow paths to the next downstream receiving stream, lake
or pond. If the developer is significantly raising runoff rates to downstream
properties and cannot demonstrate downstream conveyance capacity, some amount
of on-site stormwater management may be required in order to reduce the
proposed runoff rate down to existing runoff rates.
   B.   Requirements Applicable To All Subdivisions And Commercial
Developments: All subdivisions and commercial developments shall:
      1.   Extend the storm sewer system through the proposed development to
serve upstream properties in the natural drainage area. The storm sewer system
should reflect the ultimate development of the drainage area.
      2.   Provide a stormwater drainage system that consists of a minor
drainage system, a major drainage system and an emergency overland flow route.
      3.   The storm sewer drainage system is assumed to consist of such
components as sewers, channels, swales, natural drainageways, inlets, catch
basins, manholes, streets, detention/retention basins, and other necessary
facilities.
      4.   The engineering plans shall have a certification by a registered
professional engineer as follows:
To the best of our knowledge and belief, the drainage of surface waters will
not be changed by the construction of such subdivision or any part thereof or
that if such surface water drainage will change, adequate provision has been
made for the collection and diversion of such surface waters into public areas
or drains which the subdivider has a right to use, and that such surface waters
will not be deposited on the property of adjoining land owners in such
concentrations as may cause damage to the adjoining property because of the
construction of the subdivision.
 
Dated at     , this     day of       , A.D. 20   .
                 (Seal)
Design Engineer
      5.   The storm sewer system shall be entirely separate from the sanitary
sewer system.
      6.   Storm sewers shall be designed to convey the peak flow from a 10-
year rainfall event with a hydraulic grade line that is entirely within the
pipe. Rainfall frequency data shall be obtained from the table which is found
in the Office of the City Clerk. Storm sewers and outfalls shall be designed to
function at their design capacity during flooding conditions on the receiving
stream or other body of water.
      7.   The storm sewers shall be a minimum of twelve inches (12") in
diameter and shall be constructed of reinforced concrete pipe only unless
authorized by the Administrator.
      8.   No ditch system shall be permitted on any new site developments. The
minor drainage system shall be constructed so that the drainage from each lot
or parcel is conveyed entirely through storm sewer pipe.
      9.   The major drainage system may be permitted to flow over roadways,
rear yard and side yard swales, and other open conveyances as long as the
maximum depth of ponding or flow is no more than nine inches (9") on pavement
and one foot (1') at any other location, and the maximum water surface
elevation is at least one foot (1') below the lowest opening of any nearby
structure. The design of the major drainage system may account for the minor
drainage system (storm sewers) to be fully functional. No flow is allowed over
the road, perpendicular to the roadway.
      10.   Rear yard and side yard swales shall meet the following conditions:
         a.   The maximum side slopes shall be a four to one (4:1) ratio.
         b.   The appropriate easements are provided, a minimum of twenty feet
(20') wide.
      11.   Inlets/catch basins on roadways shall be located as necessary to
collect surface water, but spacing shall not exceed a maximum of four hundred
feet (400'). Inlets shall only be used for the first “run”, and catch basins
shall be placed before a storm sewer enters a manhole. Manholes shall be
located at the junction of two (2) or more storm sewer pipes or at any change
in grade alignment or size of pipe. Maximum spacing of manholes shall be per
the City subdivision and development regulations (see title 13 of this Code).
      12.   All storm sewers shall use materials and be installed in the manner
meeting or exceeding the requirements, standards, and specifications contained
in the “Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in
Illinois”, the most current edition, as amended, supplemented and amended by
the City or its engineer.
      13.   Where applicable, the developer shall install storm systems
sufficient in size and depth to carry the storm runoff from upstream properties
naturally tributary to the proposed subdivision. The City shall make special
provisions for the developer to recapture those additional costs incurred as a
result of oversizing and/or over-excavating the storm sewer system.
   C.   Functional Facilities Required:
      1.   Stormwater facilities shall be functional before building permits
are issued for residential and nonresidential subdivisions.
      2.   Stormwater facilities shall be functional where practicable for
single parcel developments before building construction begins.
   D.   Overland Flow Paths:
      1.   The development shall have an overland flow path at the downstream
limit of the property that will pass the base flood flow without increasing
damage to structures or property. Overland flow paths internal to the site
shall be considered as part of the major stormwater system and shall be
designed for conveyance of the base flood (critical duration) and shall be a
minimum of one cfs per tributary acre without damage to structures. If the
storm sewer pipe and inlet sized for the base flood can be constructed in lieu
of providing an overland flow path as a part of the major drainage system, then
the overland flow path shall be considered an emergency overland flow path, and
it shall not be considered a part of the major stormwater system but must still
meet the protection of buildings criteria in subsection E of this section.
      2.   For all overland flow routes, whether a part of the major drainage
system or an emergency overland flow route, the water surface elevation for
determining the FPE (flood protection elevation) shall be calculated assuming
that the storm sewers are inoperable.
      3.   Structures of any kind, including fences, shall not be permitted in
overland flow paths draining more than twenty (20) acres, unless the structures
are otherwise permissible and certified by a professional engineer or
professional landscape architect that the proposed structure will not cause any
adverse upstream impacts as a result of blocking or impeding the flow of
stormwater. A fence, if permitted, shall conform to the City’s fence ordinance
provisions for fences located in drainage easements as applicable (see title
11, chapter 8 of this Code).
   E.   Protection Of Buildings: All usable space in new buildings or added to
existing buildings hydraulically connected to a major stormwater system, site
runoff storage facility, or overland flow path shall be elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected to at least the FPE.
   F.   Depressional Storage: The function of existing on-site depressional
storage shall be preserved for both on-site and off-site tributary flows in
addition to required detention. When depressional storage is removed, it must
be compensated for in the site runoff storage facility at a one to one (1:1)
ratio; provided, that off-site areas tributary to the existing depressional
storage are routed through the site runoff storage facility. This requirement
is in addition to the site runoff storage required in section
14-6-4 of this chapter. The Administrator may allow the function of
depressional storage to be preserved if the applicant performs detailed pre-
and post-project hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to identify the effect of
the depressional storage on discharges over a range of rainfall frequencies.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-6-3: SITE RUNOFF REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Stormwater Facility Discharges: Stormwater facilities shall be required
and designed so that runoff exits the site at a point where it exited prior to
the subject development and in a manner such that flows will not increase flood
damage to adjacent property except when otherwise approved by the
Administrator. Concentrated discharges from new developments must enter
conveyance systems capable of carrying the design flow rate without increasing
flood damages or maintenance costs downstream.
   B.   Minor Stormwater System Criteria: Minor stormwater systems shall be
sized to convey runoff from the tributary watershed under fully developed
conditions for the 10-year storm event. Minor stormwater systems shall be
enclosed systems (e.g., storm sewers) unless otherwise approved by the
Administrator. Storm sewers shall be designed to convey the peak flow from a
10-year rainfall event with a hydraulic grade line that is entirely within the
pipe.
   C.   Major Stormwater System Criteria: Major stormwater systems shall be
sized to carry the base flood without causing additional flood damage. Maximum
flow depths shall be nine inches (9") in streets, parking lots and driveways;
except, that parking lots and driveways intended for access only by commercial
trucks may permit maximum flow depths of twelve inches (12"). The maximum depth
of flow in nonpaved drainage easements shall be twelve inches (12"). The
tailwater used for the major drainage system shall be the 10-year water surface
elevation in the receiving system or, in the case of stormwater detention
facilities, the 2-year design water surface elevation, plus one foot (1').
   D.   Existing Subsurface And Surface Drainage Systems: Stormwater systems
shall properly incorporate and be compatible with existing subsurface and
surface drainage systems including agricultural systems. Designs shall not
cause damage to the existing drainage system(s) or the existing adjacent or
tributary land including those with agricultural uses. The following principles
and requirements shall be observed in the design:
      1.   Off-Site Agricultural Drainage: Agricultural subsurface and surface
drainage systems shall be evaluated with regard to their capacity and
capability to properly convey low flow groundwater and site runoff storage
facility release without damage to downstream structure and land use on the
adjacent property. If the outfall drain tile and surface drainage systems prove
to be inadequate, it will be necessary to modify the existing systems or
construct new systems which will not conflict with the existing systems and
will not impact the existing agricultural land use. Existing subsurface systems
shall only be used with extended detention design and at the discretion of the
Administrator.
      2.   On-Site Agricultural Drainage: Agricultural drainage systems shall
be located and evaluated on-site. All existing on-site agricultural drain tiles
not serving a beneficial use shall be abandoned by trench removal prior to
other development and recorded on record plans. If any existing drain tiles
continue to upland watersheds, the developer must maintain drainage service
during construction until new sewers can be installed for a permanent
connection.
      3.   Off-Site Tributary Drainage: Existing drainage systems shall be
evaluated with regard to existing capabilities and reasonable future expansion
capacities. All existing tributary drain tiles shall be incorporated into the
new conduits including observation structures located at the property limits,
shall provide a free flow discharge and shall not allow surface runoff to enter
the system.
      4.   New Roadway Construction: New roadway construction shall preserve
existing subsurface systems within the right-of-way. Inspection wells shall be
placed at the right-of-way (ROW), and tiles found to not be flowing between
inspection wells at the end of the construction shall be replaced.
   E.   Design Runoff Rate:
      1.   Design runoff rates for conveyance (i.e., pipe design) may be
calculated using the Rational Method for drainage areas of less than twenty
(20) acres. For drainage areas greater than twenty (20) acres, the
Administrator may require the use of hydrograph routing.
      2.   Any design runoff rate calculation method for conveyance shall use
the data presented in Table 1: Watseka Rainfall Depths and Intensities, which
is on file in the Office of the City Clerk.
   F.   Stormwater System Easements:
      1.   For subdivision projects, the minor, major and emergency stormwater
systems shall be located within easements or rights-of-way explicitly providing
for public access for maintenance of such facilities. For all other projects
requiring a permit, easements are required for public access for maintenance of
stormwater facilities only for new construction or modifications involving
components of a drainage system that conveys runoff from off-site properties.
      2.   Easements and rights-of-way shall be of sufficient width. Storm
sewers shall be installed at such locations therein as to permit open cut
installation, maintenance and repair within the confines of the easement or
right-of-way without relocation or other unreasonable interference with other
public utilities located therein, and so as to meet the following minimum
standards: Fifteen feet (15') in width, plus for storm sewers in excess of
twenty four inches (24") in diameter, two (2) additional feet for each twelve
inches (12") or portion thereof of additional storm sewer diameter rounded up
to the next multiple of five feet (5'). Sewers with depths of greater than
fifteen feet (15') may require additional width as determined by the
Administrator.
   G.   Flow Depths: Maximum flow depths for new transverse stream crossings
shall not exceed the crown of the road during the base flood condition. The
maximum flow depth on a roadway shall not exceed nine inches (9") at the curb
line for flow parallel to the roadway. For flow parallel to a new roadway, the
product of the flow depth (in feet) and velocity (in feet per second) shall not
exceed four (4) for the base flood condition.
   H.   Diversion Of Flow To Another Watershed: Transfers of waters between
watersheds (diversions) shall be prohibited except when such transfers will not
violate the provisions of subsection
14-6-2A of this chapter and are otherwise lawful. "Watersheds", for purpose of
regulation under this subsection, shall be the major watershed divides as
determined by the Administrator.
   I.   Best Management Practices Requirements:
      1.   The City strongly encourages stormwater quality management within
the City. The developments are encouraged to incorporate the following:
         a.   All best management practices as may be required pursuant to the
United States Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq., as amended.
         b.   Manage parcels as unified sites by incorporating watershed-based
planning.
         c.   Create designs that promote a healthy aquatic ecology, and
provide for sustainability, minimize maintenance, and human intervention.
         d.   Treat stormwater as a multiple use resource.
      2.   The City does reserve the right to require stormwater quality best
management practices at a particular site if the Administrator deems that the
discharge is to a sensitive ecological area or that the intended use of the
property produces a particularly detrimental water quality of the discharge.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-6-4: SITE RUNOFF STORAGE REQUIREMENTS (DETENTION/EXTENDED DETENTION):
   A.   Release Rate:
      1.   Sufficient flood storage shall be provided so that the site will not
discharge at a rate greater than 0.15 cfs/acre of development during and after
a rainfall event with a 100-year frequency except for sites exempted in 200.3.
Unless exempted in 200.3, sites shall not discharge at a rate greater than 0.04
cfs/acre of development during and after a rainfall event with a 2-year
frequency.
      2.   This area of hydrologic disturbance on the site shall be used to
calculate the required site runoff storage volume. The on-site watershed area
tributary to the point of discharge shall be used to calculate the allowable
release rate for the site runoff storage facility, which shall be the maximum
release rate allowed considering only the on-site watershed area runoff.
   B.   Design Methods:
      1.   Event hydrograph routing methods shall be used to calculate design
runoff volumes for site runoff facilities. The methods must be HEC-1, (SCS
methodology), HEC-HMS, TR-20, or TR-55 tabular method, as appropriate, based
upon the rounding limitations of the model used. Proprietary models that use
the approved methods may be accepted at the sole discretion of the
Administrator. Digital copies of the model input files shall be provided. For
sites of forty (40) acres or more, the methods used must be acceptable to FEMA.
Event methods shall incorporate the following assumptions:
         a.   Antecedent moisture condition=2; and
         b.   Appropriate Huff rainfall distribution; and
         c.   24-hour duration storm with a one percent (1%) probability (100-
year frequency) of occurrence in any one year as specified by Illinois State
Water Survey Bulletin 70 Northeast Sectional rainfall statistics.
      2.   Figure 1, a copy which is on file in the Office of the City Clerk,
based upon generic hydrograph curves developed by the Northeastern Illinois
Planning Commission, may be used for sites of twenty (20) acres or less when
acceptable to the Administrator. The Rational Method is not acceptable.
   C.   Existing Release Rate Less Than Allowable: For sites where the
undeveloped release rate is less than the maximum release rate in subsection A
of this section, the developed release rate and corresponding site runoff
storage volume shall be based on the existing undeveloped release rate for the
development.
   D.   Downstream Water Surface Elevations: All hydrologic and hydraulic
computations must utilize appropriate assumptions for downstream water surface
elevations, from low flow through the base flood elevation, considering the
likelihood of concurrent flood events.
   E.   Extended Detention Requirement:
      1.   The requirements of this subsection will apply only when an existing
agricultural land use is downstream of and adjacent to a site runoff storage
facility outlet. The runoff from a 0.75 inch rainfall event over the
hydraulically connected impervious area of the new development shall be stored
below the elevation of the primary gravity outlet (extended detention) of the
site runoff storage facility. The facility may be designed to allow for
evapotransporation or infiltration of this volume into a subsurface drainage
system and shall not be conveyed through a direct positive connection to
downstream areas.
      2.   The hydraulically connected impervious area used in the calculation
of required extended detention volume may be reduced by the Administrator if
the soils are prepared to maximize infiltration, and deep rooted grasses or
other plants selected for their ability to promote infiltration or water
absorption are planted in areas appropriately dedicated. The reduction in
hydraulically connected impervious area used in the calculation shall be equal
to the area of the development meeting the soils/native planting requirement in
this subsection E2.
      3.   Subsurface drainage systems may be designed as a component of the
extended detention portion of the detention basin to assist in infiltration in
accordance with the following criteria:
         a.   The extended detention volume shall be discharged at a rate no
greater than that required to empty the calculated extended detention volume
within five (5) days of the storm event.
         b.   No subsurface drainage pipe shall be located within ten feet
(10') of drainage pipes directly connected to the detention basin.
         c.   For purposes of meeting the maximum subsurface drainage discharge
requirements, flow control orifices and weirs may be used.
         d.   All design-extended detention volume shall be provided above the
seasonal high groundwater table or the invert elevation of the groundwater
control system.
         e.   Farm field tile shall not be considered a subsurface drainage
system.
   F.   Site Runoff Storage Facility Design Requirements: Storage facilities
shall be designed and constructed with the following characteristics:
      1.   The site runoff storage facility shall provide one foot (1') of
freeboard above the design high water elevation.
      2.   The storage facilities shall be accessible and easily maintained.
Side slopes above the NWL shall not exceed four to one (4:1) (horizontal to
vertical) under any circumstances. For storage facilities with a bounce of
greater than four feet (4'), the maximum side slope shall not exceed five to
one (5:1) (horizontal to vertical). For industrial or commercial areas that do
not adjoin schools, residential, or planned residential areas, the
Administrator may approve four to one (4:1) side slopes for bounces up to six
feet (6'). The Administrator may require that access roads or paths on the top
of berms be provided with an H10 design load rating and meeting other City
design criteria.
      3.   Storage facilities shall facilitate sedimentation and catchment of
floating material. Unless specifically approved by the Administrator, concrete
lined low-flow ditches shall not be used in detention basins.
      4.   Storage facilities shall minimize impacts of stormwater runoff on
water quality by incorporating best management practices.
      5.   Storage facilities shall maximize the normal flow distance between
detention inlets and outlets, to the extent possible.
      6.   Storage facilities shall be designed such that the existing
conditions pre-development peak runoff rate from the 100-year, critical
duration rainfall will not be exceeded assuming the primary restrictor is
blocked.
      7.   Storage facilities with single pipe outlets shall have a minimum
inside diameter of twelve inches (12"). If design release rates necessitate a
smaller outlet, structures such as perforated risers or flow- control orifices
shall be used.
   G.   Special Rules For Iroquois River And Sugar Creek: In addition to the
requirements of subsection F of this section, the following special rules apply
to the Iroquois River and Sugar Creek:
      1.   The creeks shall be maintained, or restored, to their natural
condition. This shall include the restoration of the streambed and stream banks
where it has been channelized or tiled.
      2.   Surface or buried creeks existing in the development property or
adjacent rights-of-way shall be restored. This shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to, daylighting piped creeks and historic creek
corridors, removing fish barriers, establishing buffers and planting native
vegetation including native trees. The restoration shall emphasize water
quality, fish habitat, aquatic biodiversity, vegetation, and appropriate land
use. To the extent practicable, natural drainage patterns shall be restored
based on historical research; examination of soils; and identification of
channel, floodplain, and vegetation characteristics both upstream and
downstream for current and projected land uses.
      3.   Proposed detention ponds discharging directly to the creek shall be
required to be:
         a.   A naturalized detention pond; or
         b.   A wet bottom pond with an average depth of not less than ten feet
(10') over twenty five percent (25%) of the surface area during normal pool

water surface of the pond.
      4.   The stream may not be modified except in accordance with a
restoration project designed by and supervised by a qualified stream channel
restoration specialist under the following circumstances:
         a.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions must be
significantly improved by the modification. No significant habitat area may be
destroyed;
         b.   A natural meander pattern, pools, riffles, and substrate shall be
created;
         c.   Gentle side slopes (no steeper than 4 feet horizontally to 1 foot
vertically), including the installation of erosion control features, shall be
constructed;
         d.   Natural materials shall be used wherever possible; and
         e.   The planting and maintenance of vegetation normally associated
with streams, including primarily native riparian vegetation and upland prairie

within thirty five feet (35') of the stream banks shall be prohibited unless
otherwise approved by the Administrator.
         g.   A minimum of thirty five feet (35') of appropriate native
vegetation shall be planted and maintained along the banks of the stream.
         h.   Provisions shall be made for passive public use of the area
through the construction of trails outside of the native vegetation area
whenever practicable.
         i.   The following criteria are proposed as moderately conservative

this title; and
      2.   Store the required amount of site runoff to meet the release rate
requirement under all stream flow and backwater conditions in the receiving
stream up to the 10-year flood elevation; and
      3.   Detention volume provided by enlarging existing regulatory
floodplain storage without providing a structure controlling discharge (on-
stream detention) will be allowed only as a variance. The applicant must
demonstrate that flood damages are not increased and the development will not
increase flood flows for both the 2-year and 100-year floods on the stream with
developed conditions on the site; and
      4.   The Administrator may approve designs which can be shown by detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses to provide a net watershed benefit not
otherwise realized by strict application of the requirements in subsections H1,
H2 and H3 of this section.
   I.   Site Runoff Storage Facility Requirements Within The Regulatory
Floodway: Storage facilities located within the regulatory floodway shall:
      1.   Meet the requirements for locating storage facilities in the
regulatory floodplain; and
      2.   Be evaluated by performing hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
consistent with the standards and requirements for any adopted watershed plans;
and
      3.   Provide a net watershed benefit.
   J.   Off-Site Facilities: Site runoff storage facilities may be located off-
site if the following conditions are met:
      1.   The off-site storage facility meets all of the requirements of this
chapter; and
      2.   Adequate storage capacity in the off-site facility is dedicated to
the development; and
      3.   The development includes means to convey stormwater to the off-site
storage K. Cross-Stream Structures For Site Runoff Storage Facilities:
Structures constructed across the channel to impound water to meet detention
requirements shall be prohibited on any perennial stream unless part of a
public flood control project with a net watershed benefit. Those streams
appearing as blue on a USGS quadrangle map shall be assumed perennial unless

intermittent streams must demonstrate that they will not cause short-term or
long-term stream channel instability.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-6-5: REQUIREMENTS FOR AGRICULTURAL LAND USES:
   A.   Applicability Of Provisions: Regulations under this section apply only
to croplands, pasturelands, farmsteads and outbuildings associated with those
agricultural practices. Compliance with the requirements of this section shall
be construed as compliance with the this title for the above land uses, and no
further regulation under this title will apply. Any other land use, including
greenhouses, nurseries, container grown plants, equestrian facilities, the sale
of agricultural products to the public or where commercial activities involving
the new construction of gravel or paved parking facilities or buildings whose
aggregate area is twenty five thousand (25,000) square feet or more are
required to comply with all applicable sections of this title.
   B.   Conservation Planning And Performance Standards:
      1.   To comply with this section, landowners shall practice conservation
planning whose product shall be a management system which addresses site
runoff, soil erosion and sediment control, and surface and subsurface drainage.
Any acreage with a signed and approved NRCS conservation plan is exempt from
the requirements of this section and this title.
      2.   Applicable approved practices include:
         a.   Vegetated grass waterways.
         b.   Contour buffer strips.

with the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (current edition) or as otherwise
approved by the Iroquois County NRCS District Conservationist or the Iroquois
County Agricultural Administrator.
      3.   The performance standard for conservation planning shall be a
management system which will develop a set of field practices which will reduce
the calculated actual soil loss to the "tolerable soil loss" (T) as calculated
by the revised Universal Soil Loss Equation for the actual site conditions.
Cropland tillage and resource management methods shall be consistent with the
Technical Guide Notice IL-108 and shall be considered evidence of compliance
with the T performance standard.
   C.   Drainage Practices, Requirements And Design Criteria: Drainage for
agricultural purposes shall be consistent with those practices identified as
appropriate for “good husbandry” given the soil types, slopes and crops. An
agricultural drainage system may consist of both subsurface drainage systems
and surface drainage systems. Where active drainage districts maintain drainage
systems, they shall be consulted on surface and subsurface drainage within the
district boundaries. Requirements applying to subsurface and surface drainage
systems shall be as follows:
      1.   Subsurface Drainage Systems: Drain tile systems shall be maintained
and constructed in accordance with subsurface drainage recommendations for the
appropriate soil drainage group as specified by The Illinois Drainage Guide,
University of Illinois Extension Service Circular No. 1226. Surface inlets into
the subsurface drainage system shall be allowed only to maintain good
husbandry. Where their use cannot be practicably avoided due to topography,
they shall be installed using flow controls such as orifices and perforated
risers with gravel filters and/or vegetative filters.
      2.   Surface Drainage Systems: Surface drainage systems shall be
maintained and constructed in accordance with surface drainage recommendations
for the appropriate soil drainage group as specified by the Illinois Drainage
Guide, University of Illinois Extension Service No. 1226. Surface drainage
systems shall be built with geotechnically stable slopes, and the surface, when
applicable, shall be further stabilized utilizing the establishment of cool and
warm season grass mixes as identified in Field Office Technical Guide (Illinois
108).
      3.   Buffer Strips: Open channels with a definable bed and banks shall
use buffer strips in order to reduce the amount of erosion occurring from the
conveyed flows as well as to help filter the runoff from the site into the
waterway. Buffer strips shall be a minimum of fifteen feet (15') wide from the
top of the bank except where smaller widths are necessary due to site
limitations and when approved by the Administrator.
      4.   Compliance With Other Regulations: Agricultural drainage systems
shall also comply with all regulations regarding wetlands as enforced by
Federal, State, and local agencies.
   D.   Sediment Control For Open Channels: All open channel drainage systems
shall maintain practices adjacent to the open outlet channel that will reduce
the transportation of sediment off-site. Runoff from agricultural fields must
pass through a sediment control system prior to discharge into the open channel
conveyance system. Approved sediment control systems may consist of the
following:
      1.   Vegetated buffer zones planted with permanent grasses appropriate
for soil stabilization and filtering.
      2.   Grade control structures for over fall stabilization.
      3.   Sediment traps adjacent to the stream channel.
      4.   Other standard practices for conservation planning in accordance
with the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (current edition) or as otherwise
approved by the Iroquois County NRCS District Conservationist or the
Administrator.
   E.   Maintenance And Construction Of Drainage Systems: Agricultural drainage
systems shall be maintained so as to convey the expected flows for good
drainage practices. The existing agricultural surface drainage systems shall
not be enlarged unless such enlargement is consistent with all other provisions
of this section. Maintenance and construction of subsurface drainage systems
will not be subject to the requirements of other sections of this title except
as they are regulated by other agencies. Maintenance projects by legally
functioning drainage districts on existing agricultural drainage systems will
not be subject to further permitting requirements under this title except as
they relate to the jurisdiction of other agencies.

14-7-1: SITE PLANNING:
Sediment and erosion control planning shall be part of the initial site
planning process. In planning the development of the site, the applicant shall
consider the susceptibility of existing soils to erosion and topographic
features such as steep slopes and stream corridors which must be protected to
reduce the amount of sediment and erosion which occurs. Where appropriate,
existing vegetation shall be protected from disturbance during construction by
fencing or other means. In the planning process, the applicant shall also
address the following:
   A.   For projects that involve phased construction, existing land cover for
those areas not under current development shall be addressed. If existing land
cover does not consist of an appropriate ground cover, then these phases shall
be planted temporarily to reduce erosion from idle land.
   B.   In planning the sediment and erosion control strategy, preference shall
be given to reducing erosion rather than controlling sediment. In order to
accomplish this, the plan must carefully consider the construction sequence of
the phases so that the amount of land area exposed to erosive forces is the
minimum consistent with completing construction. In no case shall more than
twenty (20) acres of ground cover be disturbed at one time without permanent or
temporary stabilization at one time unless authorized by the Administrator.
   C.   Stormwater detention basins shall be constructed as early in the
construction process as practicable.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-7-2: STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS:
   A.   Specifications for erosion control measures shall be in accordance with
the “Illinois Urban Manual” (1995) or latest edition. Sediment and erosion
control planning shall be in accordance with “Procedures and Standards for
Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois” (revised July, 1988)
by the Urban Committee of the Association of Illinois Soil and Water
Conservation Districts (The “Green Book”) chapters 1-5. Where the Illinois
Urban Manual supersedes sections of The Green Book, the Illinois Urban Manual
shall prevail.
   B.   All projects that will result in the development of one acre or more,
except for agricultural projects regulated solely under section
14-6-5 of this title, shall be required to obtain coverage under an appropriate
NPDES permit. The permittee shall certify to the City that all required
permits, plans and inspections have been prepared and maintained in accordance
with the NPDES permit. Specifically, the permittee shall prepare and adhere to
a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) prepared for the development
project that shall meet the conditions in the permit for SWPPPs. A copy of such
plan shall be maintained on the construction site at all times that workers are
present, and a copy of the permit, SWPPP and/or inspection logs shall be
provided to the City upon request. Failure to obtain an NPDES permit or to
comply with the conditions of an NPDES permit for the construction activity
shall constitute a violation of this title.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-7-3: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The runoff from disturbed areas shall not leave the development site
without first passing through sediment control facilities. This requirement
shall apply to all phases of construction and shall include an ongoing process
of implementation of measures and maintenance of those measures during both the
construction season and any construction shutdown periods.
   B.   The smallest practical area shall be exposed for the shortest practical
time during development. However, in no case shall more than twenty (20) acres
be exposed at one time on a development unless a larger area is approved by the
Administrator.
   C.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected whenever possible.
Areas within twenty five feet (25') of natural watercourses, lakes, ponds and
wetlands should be left undisturbed whenever possible.
   D.   All applicants for developments of one acre or more shall submit an
application for an NPDES permit or a notice of intent (NOI) to be covered under
a general NPDES permit. A copy of any stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPPP) required by such permit shall be provided to the City prior to
commencement of development activities, and a copy shall be kept on the
development site at all times.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-7-4: EXTENDED CONSTRUCTION SHUTDOWN PERIODS:
The condition of the construction site for the winter shutdown period shall
address proper sediment and erosion control early in the fall growing season so
that slopes and other bare earth areas may be stabilized with temporary and/or
permanent vegetative cover. All open areas that are to remain idle throughout
the winter shall receive temporary erosion control measures including temporary
seeding, mulching and/or erosion control blanketing prior to the end of the
fall growing season. The areas to be worked beyond the end of the growing
season must incorporate soil stabilization measures that do not rely on
vegetative cover such as erosion control blankets and heavy mulching. In no
case shall requirements less than those required by IEPA NPDES Permit ILR10
apply to projects disturbing more than one acre.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-7-5: HYDRAULIC AND HYDROLOGIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
In the hydraulic and hydrologic design of major erosion control measures (those
of which the tributary drainage area is greater than 3 acres) such as sediment
basins and traps, diversions, and the like, the design frequency shall be
commensurate with the risk of the design event being exceeded. The following
design frequencies shall be regarded as minimum design frequencies for the
construction period:
   A.   For those projects whose construction period is less than six (6)
months, the storm event having a fifty percent (50%) chance (2-year event) of
being exceeded in any year shall be used for design purposes;
   B.   For those projects whose construction period is greater than six (6)
months but less than one year, the design frequency for major sediment basins
shall be a rainfall event with a twenty percent (20%) (5-year event) chance of
being exceeded in any one year; and
   C.   For those construction projects expected to last more than one year,
major sediment basins shall be designed for a rainfall event with a ten percent
(10%) (10-year event) chance of being exceeded in any one year.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-7-6: “AS-NEEDED” PRACTICES ON PLANS:
The sediment and erosion control plan shall designate a series of practices
which shall be implemented, either at the direction of the permittee or the
permittee's representative, on-site or at the direction of the Administrator
should an inspection of the site indicate a deficiency in soil and sediment
erosion control measures. As a minimum, these measures shall include the
following:
   A.   Sedimentation basins.
   B.   Sediment traps.
   C.   Diversion swales.
   D.   Silt fences.

this title but shall include the following:
   A.   Detailed construction phasing plan identifying sediment and erosion
control measures to be in place for each phase shall be submitted prior to
stripping the site of existing vegetation or cover.
   B.   Sediment and erosion control measures to be installed initially prior
to stripping existing vegetation or mass grading shall be indicated on the
plans.
   C.   Permanent stabilization measures shall be indicated on a separate plan.
   D.   The expected 2-year and 10-year runoff rates from all off-site areas
draining into the site shall be identified on the plan.
   E.   Methods for conveying flows through the site during construction shall
be indicated. These methods must include the temporary and permanent
stabilization measures to be used to reduce velocity and erosion from flow
through the construction zone.
   F.   A maintenance schedule of each measure used shall be indicated on the
plan. As a minimum, all sediment and erosion control measures on-site shall be
inspected weekly and also by the applicant's designee or after a one-half inch
(½") or greater rainfall event, and any required repairs shall be made to keep
these measures functional as designed. All repairs and modifications shall be
reviewed by the Administrator or his/her designee.

14-7-9: STOCKPILES:
Stockpiles of soil and other erodible or floatable building materials (sand,
limestone, etc.) shall not be located in floodplains, overflow routes or areas
subject to frequent inundation. If a stockpile is to remain in place for more
than three (3) days, then sediment and erosion control shall be provided for
the stockpile.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-7-10: STORM SEWER INLETS:
Storm sewer inlets, catch basins, and manholes with open lid grates shall be
protected with manufactured filtration devices developed to prevent sediments
from entering the drainage system. Silt screens, hay bales, and filter fabrics
under storm grates are not allowed.

14-7-12: PROTECTION OF ROADWAYS:
Graveled roads, access drives, parking areas of sufficient width and length,
and vehicle wash down facilities, if necessary, shall be provided to prevent
soils from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any soil tracked onto
a public or private roadway shall be removed before the end of each workday or
sooner as directed by the authority maintaining the roadway.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-7-13: TEMPORARY STREAM CROSSINGS:
   A.   Temporary stream crossings of intermittent and perennial streams used
only for and during construction shall be designed to convey a 2-year flood
(minimum) or other flood event approved by the Administrator without
overtopping unless a more frequent design event is allowed by the
Administrator.
   B.   The entire crossing shall be designed to withstand hydrodynamic forces
and erosive forces up to the base flood event without washing out.
   C.   Ephemeral streams may be crossed at temporary at-grade crossings;
provided, that the crossing point is stabilized with materials resistive to the
erosive forces produced by runoff from the upstream drainage area, and the
design is approved by the Administrator.
   D.   Temporary stream crossings shall be removed upon completion of
construction activities. All temporary stream crossing shall be completely
removed and the stream restored to its preconstruction condition upon
completion of construction.

14-8-1: APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION:
   A.   This chapter, including article A, sets forth requirements for
developments within floodplains and floodways. In addition, developments in the
SFHA draining more than one square mile with no designated floodway must meet
IDNR-OWR 17 Illinois Administrative Code Part 3700 Rules. Projects which meet
all the requirements and conditions to be considered permitted under IDNR-OWR
Statewide, regional and general permits, and are not in designated floodways,
shall be considered to have met the technical requirements of this section.
References to IDNR/OWR permits or approvals in this section shall be construed
as “their designee” where a portion or all of their authority has been
delegated.
   B.   All developments shall meet the requirements set forth in Table 2 -
Summary of Applicable Title Section for Development in Floodplains, a copy of
which is on file in the Office of the City Clerk. The table is intended only as
a guide to indicate the applicable sections of this title for development in
floodplains.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8-2: FLOODPLAIN, REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN, BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE) AND
REGULATORY FLOODWAY LOCATIONS:
   A.   The BFE shall be delineated onto the site topography to establish the
regulatory floodplain area limits for regulation under this title. Regulatory
floodplains shall be delineated onto the site map from the current FEMA, FIRM,
FBFM or LOMR and include those areas of the SFHA which are not regulatory
floodplains. The Community remains responsible for maintaining the effective
FIS and a list of FIRM panels.
   B.   The BFE shall be:
      1.   The elevation of the 100-year profile corresponding to the location
of the development as indicated in the flood profiles in the FEMA flood
insurance studies listed in appendix B of this title (which may be updated from
time to time), a copy of which is on file in the Office of the City Clerk; or
      2.   In the case of FEMA delineated “AH Zones”, the elevation noted on
the map shall be the BFE. In the case of FEMA delineated “AO Zones”, the BFE
shall be the depth number shown on the map added to the highest adjacent grade,
or at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number
is provided; or
      3.   When no BFE information exists and the upstream tributary drainage
area is six hundred forty (640) acres or greater, the BFE shall be determined
using a site-specific floodplain study by a professional engineer using
appropriate hydrologic and hydraulic models acceptable to FEMA and IDNR/OWR, as
follows:
         a.   Where a channel has a tributary drainage area of six hundred
forty (640) acres or more, the above analyses shall be submitted to the IDNR/
OWR for concurrent approval.
         b.   For a nonriverine regulatory floodplain, the historic flood of
record, plus three feet (3'), may be used for the BFE instead of performing a
detailed hydrologic and hydraulic study for developments of less than forty
(40) acres, at the discretion of the Administrator.
      4.   For floodplains that are not regulatory, are not draining more than
six hundred forty (640) acres, and with no BFE determined, the Administrator
may require a site-specific floodplain study for the purpose of establishing an
FPE for the development. A site-specific study is required for all developments
of forty (40) acres or more that have a regulatory floodplain on any portion of
the site.
   C.   1.   The location of the regulatory floodway shall be as delineated on
the current effective regulatory maps maintained by the City. The location of
the regulatory floodway boundary shall be scaled onto the site plan using
references common to both the map and the plan (typically the centerlines of
adjacent roadways). Where an interpretation is needed to determine the exact
location of the regulatory floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted.
Note: If an area of the site is located in the regulatory floodway that is
higher than the BFE, that area is subject to the floodway standards of section
14-8-8 of this chapter, including the appropriate use criteria, until such time
as an LOMR is received from the IDNR/OWR and FEMA.
      2.   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations in the regulatory
floodway are as follows:
         a.   The flood profiles, flows, and data in the current effective FIS
must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to
be in error or conditions have changed, FEMA and IDNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
The Administrator shall be copied on all related correspondence.
         b.   If the BFE at the site of the proposed development is affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the
proposed development shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section
with the receiving stream at both the normal water and BFEs.
         c.   If the applicant is informed by IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream or upstream restrictive bridge or culvert is
scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, or modified, or a regional flood
control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified
within the next five (5) years, the proposed development shall be analyzed and
shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions
and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood
control project is built, removed or modified as applicable.
         d.   If the appropriate use will result in a change in the regulatory
floodway location or a change in the BFE, the applicant shall submit the
information required to be issued a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)
to IDNR/OWR and FEMA. A public notice inviting public comment on the proposed
change in the BFE or location of the regulatory floodway will be issued by
IDNR/OWR or its designee before a CLOMR is issued. Filling, grading, dredging
or excavating may take place upon issuance of a conditional approval from IDNR/
OWR and the Administrator. No further development activities shall take place
in the existing or proposed floodplain until a letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA unless such activities meet all the requirements of section
14-8-3 of this chapter. The Administrator shall be copied on all related
correspondence.
         e.   For those circumstances listed below and located in a regulatory
floodway, the following information shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their
review and concurrence:
            (1)   Analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge,
culvert crossings and roadway approaches.
            (2)   An engineer’s determination that an existing bridge, culvert
crossing or approach road is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile.
            (3)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage.
            (4)   Stormwater management permits to local units of government
for regulatory floodway and floodplain development.
            (5)   IDNR/OWR will issue permits for any IDNR/OWR projects, dams,
etc., and all other State, Federal or Community projects.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8-3: GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following general performance standards are applicable to all development
in a regulatory floodplain. The standards of this section apply except when
superseded by more stringent requirements in the subsequent sections.
   A.   No development except as allowed in section
14-8-10 of this chapter shall be allowed in the regulatory floodplain that
singularly or cumulatively creates an increase in flood stage or velocity off-
site, or a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or
velocity on-site or threat to public health, safety and welfare.
   B.   For all projects involving a channel modification, fill, stream
maintenance or a levee, the flood conveyance and storage capacity of the
regulatory floodplain shall not be reduced.
   C.   If the proposed development would result in a change in the regulatory
floodplain or BFE, the applicant shall obtain an LOMA/LOMR from FEMA. If the
development will result in an increase in the BFE of more than one foot (1') at
any location, a CLOMR must be obtained before any work is performed in the
regulatory floodplain. No buildings may be built in the existing or proposed
regulatory floodplain until the LOMA/LOMR receives concurrence from IDNR/OWR
and is issued by FEMA unless the building meets all the building protection
standards of section
14-8-5 of this chapter. Proposed changes to the regulatory floodway delineation
and the BFE must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence.
   D.   If the development is located in a public body of water, as defined by
IDNR/OWR, a permit must also be received from IDNR/OWR.
   E.   Prior to the commencement of any construction, modification or removal
of a dam, the developer shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit or letter
indicating a permit is not required.
   F.   1. For public flood control projects, the floodplain management
standards will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR
that each of the following conditions are met:
         a.   Demonstrate by hydraulic and hydrologic modeling that the
proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood
heights outside the project site or demonstrate that any increases will be
contained in easements for all flood events up to and including the base flood
event.
         b.   Demonstrate that the project will be operated and maintained by a
public agency.
         c.   Demonstrate that the project will reduce flood damage to an
existing building or structure.
      2.   These standards do not preclude the design, engineering,
construction or financing, in whole or in part, of a public flood control
project by persons who are not public agencies.
   G.   Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, and planned
unit developments (PUDs) and additions to manufactured home parks and additions
to subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
data and floodway delineations.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8-4: PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTION STANDARDS:
   A.   New and replacement water supply systems, wells and sanitary sewer
lines may be permitted if all manholes or other aboveground openings located
below the FPE are watertight.
   B.   New or replacement on-site waste disposal systems are not allowed in
the regulatory floodplain within the City limits.
   C.   New, substantially improved or replacement wastewater treatment plants
shall have watertight openings for those openings located below the FPE. Such
facilities should be located to avoid impairment to the facility or
contamination of floodwaters during the base flood.
   D.   No developments in the SFHA shall include the locating or storing of
hazardous materials, buoyant materials, solid wastes, fertilizers, pesticides
or other toxic materials or potential pollutants.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8-5: BUILDING PROTECTION STANDARDS:
These building protection standards apply to all buildings located in the
regulatory floodplain; however, it should be noted that most new and
replacement buildings are not appropriate uses of the regulatory floodway.
   A.   The lowest floor, including basements, of all new residential
structures, substantially improved structures and additions shall be elevated
up to at least the FPE. An attached garage for a structure must be elevated up
to at least 0.1 foot above the BFE.
      1.   If placed on fill, the top of the fill for the residential structure
shall be above the FPE. The top of the fill for an attached garage shall be at
least 0.1 foot above the BFE. The fill shall be placed at that elevation for a
distance of twenty feet (20') out from the building unless the building design
is certified by a registered structural engineer to be protected from damages
due to hydrostatic pressures. Additionally, the fill shall not settle below the
FPE for the residential structure and not below 0.1 foot above the base flood
for an attached garage, and shall be adequately protected against erosion,
scour and differential settlement. The building shall meet all of the
requirements of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01.
      2.   If elevated by means of walls, pilings, or other foundation, the
building's supporting structure must be permanently open to floodwaters and not
subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood. The permanent
openings shall be no more than one foot (1') above existing grade, and consist
of a minimum of two (2) openings. The openings must have a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding below the BFE. The lowest inside grade must match the
lowest existing outside grade adjacent to the structure. The foundation and
supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and
adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces
such as current, waves, ice and floating debris. All areas below the FPE shall
be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor
(including basement) for the residential structure and all electrical, heating,
ventilating, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall
be located at or above the FPE. An attached garage must be elevated to at least
0.1 foot above the BFE. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines,
submersible pumps and other waterproofed service facilities may be located
below the FPE. No area below the FPE shall be used for storage,
   B.   The lowest floor, including the basement, of all new or substantially
improved nonresidential buildings shall be elevated at least to the FPE as
described in subsection A of this section or be structurally dry floodproofed
to at least the FPE. A nonresidential building may be structurally dry
floodproofed (in lieu of elevation); provided, that a professional engineer or
registered structural engineer shall certify that the building has been
structurally dry floodproofed below the FPE, and the structure and attendant
utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the
base flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities,
duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of
buoyancy and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures shall be
operable without human intervention and without an outside source of
electricity. (Levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered
floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection.)
   C.   Manufactured Homes and recreational vehicles to be installed on a site
for more than one hundred eighty (180) days shall be at or above the FPE and
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in
accordance with the Illinois Manufactured Home Installation Code (77 Illinois
Administrative Code 870 1999), as amended.
   D   1. Accessory structures, such as toolsheds and detached garages, which
are not substantial improvements on an existing single-family lot, may be
constructed with the lowest floor below the FPE in accordance with the
following criteria:
         a.   The building shall not be used for human habitation.
         b.   All areas below the FPE shall be constructed with waterproof
material. Structures located in a regulatory floodway shall meet the floodway
standards in section
14-8-8 of this chapter.
         c.   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation and
movement.
         d.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed to the FPE.
         e.   The building shall be no greater than six hundred (600) square
feet in floor size, and be valued at less than seven thousand five hundred
dollars ($7,500.00). The building shall meet the permanent opening criteria of
subsection A2 of this section.
         f.   The building shall be used only for the storage of vehicles or
tools and may not contain basements or other rooms, workshops, greenhouses or
similar uses.
      2.   Accessory structures that do not meet all of the criteria in this
subsection may be constructed if they are dry floodproofed or elevated at least
one-half foot (0.5') above the BFE.
   E.   Garages, sheds other minor accessory structures constructed ancillary
to an existing use may be permitted provided the following conditions are met:
      1.   The garage or shed must be non-habitable.
      2.   The garage or shed must be used only for the storage of vehicles and
tools and cannot be modified later into another use.
      3.   The garage or shed must be located outside of the floodway or have
the appropriate state and/or federal permits.
      4.   The garage or shed must be on a lot and be accessory to an existing
principle structure on the same lot.
      5.   Below the base flood elevation, the garage or shed must be built of
materials not susceptible to flood damage.
      6.   All utilities, plumbing, heating, air conditioning and electrical
must be elevated above the flood protection elevation.
      7.   The garage or shed must have at least one permanent opening on each
wall not more than one (1) foot above grade with one (1) square inch of opening
for every one (1) square foot of floor area.
      8.   The garage or shed must be less than fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000) in market value or replacement cost whichever is greater or less than
five hundred and seventy six (576') square feet (24' x 24').
      9.   The structure shall be anchored to resist floatation and
overturning.
      10.   All flammable or toxic materials (gasoline, paint, insecticides,
fertilizers, etc.) shall be stored above the flood protection elevation.
      11.   The lowest floor elevation should be documented and the owner
advised of the flood insurance implications.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014; amd. Ord. 2566, 4-28-2020)
14-8-6: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other disaster may be
restored unless the damage meets or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its market
value before it was damaged, in which case, it shall conform to the building
protection standards of this title.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8-7: COMPENSATORY STORAGE VOLUME STANDARDS:
The following standards apply within the regulatory floodplain or, for sites
draining more than six hundred forty (640) acres, the limits of the delineated
floodplain as accepted by the Administrator:
   A.   Hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage volume will be required
for development in a riverine regulatory floodplain and shall be at least equal
to the regulatory floodplain flood storage volume displaced. The storage volume
displaced below the existing 10-year frequency flood elevation must be replaced
below the proposed 10-year frequency flood elevation. The storage volume
displaced above the 10-year existing frequency flood elevation must be replaced
above the proposed 10-year frequency flood elevation. Additional storage of not
less than fifty percent (50%) of the net volume displaced shall be provided
based upon the total volume filled below the BFE. The additional fifty percent
(50%) need not be hydraulically equivalent. The volume of storage lost shall be
calculated based on the existing BFE, and the volume of compensatory storage
shall be calculated based upon the final project BFE.
   B.   Compensatory storage volume for development in a nonriverine regulatory
floodplain area that is also adjacent to a lake shall be equal to the storage
volume displaced. Additional storage of not less than fifty percent (50%) of
the net volume displaced shall be provided. The volume of storage lost shall be
calculated based on the existing BFF, and the volume of compensatory shall be
calculated based upon the final project BFE.
   C.   Compensatory storage volume requirements for development in a
nonriverine regulatory floodplain that is not adjacent to a lake shall be
replaced in accordance with the requirements for the loss of depressional
storage in subsection
14-6-2F of this title.
   D.   The hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage areas shall be
designed to drain freely and openly to the channel and shall be located
adjacent to the development. This standard does not apply to nonriverine
regulatory floodplain.
   E.   A recorded covenant running with the land is required to maintain the
compensatory storage volume in areas modified to provide compensatory storage
volume.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8-8: FLOODWAY STANDARDS:
The only development in a regulatory floodway which will be allowed is
appropriate uses which will not cause an increase in flood heights or
velocities for all flood events up to and including the base flood. Only those
appropriate uses listed in subsection A of this section will be allowed in the
regulatory floodway. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or
placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts,
fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and
storage of materials except as specifically defined in said subsection A as an
appropriate use. If the development is proposed for the regulatory floodway
portion of the regulatory floodplain, the following standards apply in addition
to the standards for the regulatory floodplain:
   A.   Only the construction, modification, repair or replacement of the
following appropriate uses will be allowed in the regulatory floodway:
      Boathouses or other nonhabitable structures without sanitary facilities
that are accessory to existing buildings and will not block flood flows nor
reduce regulatory floodway storage.
      Bridges, culverts and associated roadways, sidewalks and railways
required for crossing the regulatory floodway or for access to other
appropriate uses in the regulatory floodway and any modification thereto.
      Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures
including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or
the construction of floodwalls or berms around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall or berm
shall be no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the
existing structure, and which are not considered to be substantial improvements
to the structure.
      Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the BFE and which will not block
flood flows. These modifications include fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios
and second story additions. No enclosed floor areas may be built on stilts. The
modifications may not singularly or cumulatively equal fifty percent (50%) or
more of the building's market value.
      Public flood control structures and private improvements relating to the
control of drainage and flooding of existing buildings, erosion, water quality
or habitat for fish and wildlife.
      Recreational facilities such as playing fields, open pavilions, gazebos
and trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when
viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows.
      Regulatory floodway grading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a channel.
      Repair, replacement or reconstruction of a damaged building; provided,
that none of the outside dimensions of the building are increased; and
provided, that the cost of repair is less than fifty percent (50%) of the
building's value before it was damaged. When damage is fifty percent (50%) or
more (a substantial improvement), the activity shall conform to section
14-8-5 of this chapter.
      Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls.
      Structures or facilities relating to functionally water dependent uses
such as additions, modifications, and improvements to existing wastewater
treatment plants (except for additions to habitable structures on the site) and
facilities and improvements relating to recreational boating (this does not
include new wastewater treatment plants).
      Underground and overhead utilities.
   B.   Additions or changes to the list of appropriate uses in subsection A of
this section must be approved by the Administrator prior to the adoption by
IDNR/OWR.
   C.   All development in the regulatory floodway shall require a permit from
IDNR/OWR and must be in accordance with all provisions of this title.
   D.   Construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible;
provided, that the proposed project meets the following engineering and
mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans,
calculations and data prepared and signed by a professional engineer:
      1.   All effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the
development of appropriate uses, other than bridge or culvert crossings or on-
stream structures or dams, shall be replaced for all flood events up to and
including the base flood.
      2.   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used to
determine transition sections in calculations of effective regulatory floodway
conveyance:
         a.   Flowing water will expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
         b.   Flowing water will contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
         c.   Flowing water will not expand or contract faster than one foot
(1') vertical for every ten feet (10') of flooded stream length.
         d.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
         e.   Transition sections must be used to determine the effective
conveyance areas on adjacent properties.
      3.   Development of an appropriate use will not result in an increase in
the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage. However, in the
case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be
increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be
avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
   E.   In the case of on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water during normal or flood flows, the increase in flood stage when compared
to existing conditions for all storm events up to and including the base flood
event shall be contained within recorded easements or the channel banks. A dam
safety permit or letter indicating a dam safety permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for such structures.
   F.   IDNR/OWR will issue permits for all floodway projects including IDNR/
OWR projects, dams, etc., and for all other State or Community projects.
   G.   If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be
demonstrated that:
      1.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would
accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body
of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization,
floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a
stream side buffer strip of greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if
the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish
and wildlife habitat;
      2.   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification, and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
      3.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed
in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of
the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match
as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section,
slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified,
restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into
channel modification design, where practical.
         b.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the
upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
         c.   One-sided construction off a channel shall be used when feasible.
Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of
the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects
of the vegetation.
         d.   Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is
essential for construction of the channel.
         e.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper
than three to one (3:1), horizontal to vertical, wherever practical. Natural
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction
rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
         f.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to the establishment of the vegetative
cover.
         g.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity
such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established where
appropriate.
         h.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the
modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
         i.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry, and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
         j.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel
enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated
by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as
part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
         k.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control project,
there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the
floodway as a result of the modification; and
      4.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8-9: RIVERINE FLOODPLAINS:
These standards apply to riverine regulatory floodplains without a regulatory
floodway. The applicant shall obtain approval from IDNR/OWR for all development
any portion of which is located partially or completely within the regulatory
floodplain (without a delineated regulatory floodway) with a tributary drainage
area of six hundred forty (640) acres or more.
   A.   The development shall not singularly or cumulatively result in an
obstruction of flood flows or potential flood damages outside the site due to
an increase in flood heights, velocities, or loss of floodplain area storage.
   B.   A professional engineer shall submit a study that demonstrates one of
the following:
      1.   Determine a floodway which meets the definition of a REGULATORY
FLOODWAY in section
14-2-1 of this title and demonstrate that the proposed development meets the
floodway standards in section
14-8-8 of this chapter; or
      2.   Determine a BFE and demonstrate that the proposed development will
maintain the existing conditions conveyance, will not increase flood
velocities, will not increase flood profiles and will compensate for any lost
floodplain storage.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8-10: BRIDGE AND CULVERT STANDARDS:
These standards are for the reconstruction, modification or new construction of
bridges, culvert crossings and roadway approaches located in the regulatory
floodplain.
   A.   A proposed new structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for
all flood events up to and including the base flood event unless contained
within the channel banks or recorded easements. The evaluation must be
submitted to the IDNR/OWR for review and a permit obtained.
   B.   If the proposed new structure will increase upstream flood stages
greater than 0.1 foot, the applicant must contact IDNR/OWR for a dam safety
permit or waiver. The Administrator shall be copied on all related
correspondence.
   C.   Lost regulatory floodplain storage must be replaced as required in
section
14-8-7 of this chapter; except, that artificially created storage lost due to a
reduction in head loss behind an existing bridge or culvert crossing shall not
be required to be replaced, provided no flood damage will be incurred
downstream.
   D.   Velocity increases must be mitigated by use of appropriate measures to
avoid scour, erosion and sedimentation at the structure.
   E.   For modification or replacement of existing structures, the existing
structure must first be evaluated in accordance with IDNR/OWR Rules (17
Illinois Administrative Code Part 3708) to determine if the existing structure
is a source of flood damage. If the structure is a source of flood damage, the
applicant’s engineer shall submit justification to allow the damage to continue
and evaluate the feasibility of relieving the structure's impact. Modifications
or replacement structures shall not increase flood stages (0.0 feet) compared
to the existing condition for all flood events up to and including the base
flood event. The evaluation must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and
concurrence before a permit is issued. The Administrator shall be copied on all
related correspondence.
   F.   If any work is proposed in, near or over a public body of water, a
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR.
   G.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing
the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to
IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required.
   H.   Construction vehicles shall cross streams by the means of existing
bridges or culverts. Where an existing crossing is not available, a temporary
crossing that has been issued a permit or waiver by IDNR/OWR shall be
constructed in which:
      1.   The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above existing grade.
      2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the
water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall.
      3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet
(2') below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be
nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.
      4.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one
year after installation, unless an extension of time is granted by the
Administrator.

This article shall be known and may be cited as THE CITY OF WATSEKA
CONSERVATION PLAN ORDINANCE.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8A-2: STATUTE AUTHORITY:
The Conservation Plan is adopted by the Mayor and City Council under the
authority of 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-13-1 et seq.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8A-3: JURISDICTION:
   A.   The City asserts its jurisdiction over all isolated wetlands within the
City corporate limits and facilities planning areas that were formerly under
the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prior to January 9, 2000.
   B.   The requirements of this article apply to all platted and unplatted
lands within the jurisdiction of the City.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8A-4: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   It is the purpose and intent of this article to promote the health,
safety and general welfare of the present and future residents of the City and
downstream drainage areas by providing for the protection, preservation, proper
maintenance, and use of City watercourses, lakes, ponds, floodplain and wetland
areas. All work to be done in a conservation area will require a permit from
the Army Corps of Engineers. The responsibility for obtaining the permit is by
the applicant. If requested by the City, a sign-off from the Army Corps of
Engineers will be required if the site appears to be near a wetland area.
Absolutely no work shall be undertaken until the Administrator has received an
approved permit by the Army Corps of Engineers.
   B.   This article is more specifically adopted:
      1.   To prevent flood damage by preserving stormwater and floodwater
storage capacity (including depressional storage);
      2.   To maintain the normal hydrologic balance of streams, floodplains,
ponds, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater by storing and providing for
infiltration of wet-period runoff in floodplains and wetlands, and releasing it
slowly to the stream to maintain in-stream flow;
      3.   To manage stormwater runoff and maintain natural runoff conveyance
systems, and minimize the need for major storm sewer construction and
drainageway modification;
      4.   To improve water quality, both by filtering and storing sediments
and attached pollutants, nutrients, and organic compounds before they drain
into streams or wetlands, and by maintaining the natural pollutant-assimilating
capabilities of streams, floodplains and wetlands;
      5.   To protect shorelines and stream banks from soil erosion, using
natural means and materials wherever possible;
      6.   To protect fish spawning, breeding, nursery and feeding grounds;
      7.   To protect wildlife habitat;
      8.   To preserve areas of special recreational, scenic, or scientific
interest, including natural areas and habitats of endangered species;
      9.   To maintain and enhance the aesthetic qualities of developing areas;
and
      10.   To encourage the continued economic growth and high quality of life
of the City which depends in part on an adequate quality of water, a pleasing
natural environment, and recreational opportunities in proximity to the City.
   C.   In order to achieve the purpose and intent of this article, the City
hereby designates the Conservation Plan that shall be considered as an overlay
to the zoning districts created by City zoning ordinances, as amended (see
title 12 of this Code). Any proposed development activity within the district
must obtain a site development permit as approved by the Governing Body of
City. See section
14-8A-5 of this article.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8A-5: SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Permit Required: To ensure that proposed development activity can be
carried out in a manner which is compatible and harmonious with the natural
amenities of the Conservation Plan and with surrounding land uses, a request
for a site development permit for such development activity must be submitted
for approval by the Administrator.
   B.   Conditions Of Permit Issuance:
      1.   No site development permit shall be issued unless the City finds
that:
         a.   The development will not detrimentally affect or destroy natural
features such as ponds, streams, wetlands, and forested areas, nor impair their
natural functions, but will preserve and incorporate such features into the
development’s site;
         b.   The location of natural features and the site's topography have
been considered in the designing and siting of all physical improvements;
         c.   Adequate assurances have been received that the clearing of the
site of topsoil, trees, and other natural features will not occur before the
commencement of building operations. Only those areas approved for the
placement of physical improvements may be cleared;
         d.   The development will not reduce the natural retention storage
capacity of any watercourse, nor increase the magnitude and volume of flooding
at other locations; and that, in addition, the development will not increase
stream velocities; and
         e.   The soil and subsoil conditions are suitable for excavation and
site preparation, and the drainage is designed to prevent erosion and
environmentally deleterious surface runoff.
      2.   There shall be no development, including the immediate or future
clearing or removal of natural ground cover and/or trees, within the
conservation areas for any purpose, unless a site development permit is granted
subject to the provisions of this article or the provisions of the City zoning
ordinance.
      3.   Dumping, filling, mining, excavating, dredging, or transferring of
any earth material within the district is prohibited unless a site development
permit is granted.
      4.   No ponds or impoundments shall be created nor other alterations or
improvements shall be allowed in the district for recreational uses, stormwater
management, flood control, agricultural uses or as scenic features unless a
site development permit is granted.
   C.   Application For Permit: Application for a site development permit shall
be made by the owner of the property, or his/her authorized agent, to the City,
on a form furnished for that purpose. Each application shall bear the name(s)
and address(es) of the owner or developer of the site and of any consulting
firm retained by the applicant, together with the name of the applicant’s
principal contact at such firm, and shall be accompanied by a filing fee of two
hundred dollars ($200.00) unless the application is part of a subdivision
review where other fees take priority. The applicant further agrees to
reimburse the City for any outside review engineering fees incurred by the City
in addition to the filing fees. Each application shall include certification
that any land clearing, construction, or development involving the movement of
earth shall be in accordance with the plans approved upon issuance of the
permit.
   D.   Submissions: Each application for a site development permit shall be
accompanied by the following information: general provisions, site development
plan, geologic and soil report, drainage control plan, site grading and
excavation plan, landscape plan, justification for watercourse relocation and
minor modifications, stream modification/relocation plan, channel and bank
armoring, culverts, on-stream impoundments, and an impact assessment.
   E.   Review And Approval: Each application for a site development permit
shall be reviewed and acted upon according to the following procedures:
      1.   The City will review each application for a site development permit
to determine its conformance with the provisions of this article. The City may
also refer any application to any other local government or public agency
within whose jurisdiction the site is located for review and comments. Within
thirty (30) days after receiving an application, the City shall, in writing: a)
approve the permit application, if it is found to be in conformance with the
provisions of this article, and issue the permit; b) approve the permit
application subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure
substantially the objectives of this article, and issue the permit subject to
these conditions; or c) disapprove the permit application, indicating the
deficiencies and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or
submission.
      2.   No site development permit shall be issued for an intended
development site unless:
         a.   The development, including, but not limited to, subdivisions and
planned unit developments, has been approved by the City where applicable; or
         b.   Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the City; or
         c.   The proposed development is coordinated with any overall
development program previously approved by the City for the area in which the
site is situated.
   F.   Exemptions From Permit:
      1.   The provisions of this article shall not apply to:
         a.   Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. When
emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall
report the pertinent facts relating to the work to the Administrator within ten
(10) days after commencement of the work and shall thereafter obtain a site
development permit and shall perform such work as may be determined by the
agency to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment to the watercourse,
lake, pond, floodplain or wetland;
         b.   Work consisting of the operation, repair, or maintenance of any
lawful use of land existing on the effective date hereof;
         c.   Lands adjacent to farm ditches if:
            (1)   Such lands are not adjacent to a natural stream or river; or
            (2)   Those parts of such drainage ditches adjacent to such lands
were not streams before ditching; or
            (3)   Such lands are maintained in agricultural uses without
buildings and structures.
      2.   Where farm ditches are found to contribute to adverse environmental
impacts or hazards to persons or property, the City may include designated farm
ditches in the district. The City may also require that linings, bulkheads,
dikes and culverts be removed to mitigate hazards, or that other mitigative
measures be taken, such as the maintenance of a natural vegetation buffer
strip.
   G.   Effect On Other Permits: The granting of a site development permit
under the provisions of this section shall in no way affect the owner’s
responsibility to obtain the approval required by any other statute, ordinance,
or regulation of any State agency or subdivision thereof, or to meet other City
ordinances and regulations. Where State and/or Federal permits are required, a
site development permit will not be issued until they are obtained.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8A-6: GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR AREA AFFECTED:
   A.   Application Of Certain Provisions:
      1.   This article applies to development in or near streams, lakes, ponds
and wetlands within City. Streams, lakes, and ponds (including intermittent
streams) are those which are shown on the United States Department of the
Interior Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle National Wetlands
Inventory Maps and those additional streams, lakes, and ponds as identified by
the Administrator. Those are hereby made a part of this article, and two (2)
copies thereof shall remain on file at the City administrative building for
public inspection.
      2.   Wetlands are those designated by the most recent version of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers Manual of Wetland Delineation.
      3.   If new drainagecourses, lakes, ponds or wetlands are created as part
of a development, the requirements for setbacks and uses within setbacks, and
the criteria for watercourse relocation and minor modification shall apply. The
district shall be amended as appropriate to include these areas.
   B.   Conservation Areas: The conservation areas shall be considered as an
overlay to the zoning districts created by the City zoning ordinance, as
amended (see title 12 of this Code). In addition to the requirements of this
article, applicants for a site development permit within the district shall
meet all requirements of the underlying zoning districts. In the event of a
conflict between the overlay district requirements and the underlying zoning
district requirements, the most restrictive requirements prevail.
   C.   District Boundary: The procedures, standards and requirements contained
in this article shall apply to all lots within wetlands and streams, and all
lots lying wholly or in part:
      1.   Within the special flood hazard area (SFHA) designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); or
      2.   Within one hundred feet (100') of the ordinary high water mark
(OHWM) of a perennial stream or intermittent stream, the ordinary high water
mark of a lake or pond, or the edge of a wetland; or
      3.   Within depressional areas serving as floodplain or stormwater
storage areas, as designated on the conservation areas.
   D.   Minimum Setback Of Development Activity From Streams, Lakes,
Depressional Storage, Ponds And Wetlands:
      1.   Absolutely no development activity (except as provided below) may
occur within the minimum setback. The minimum setback should be a vegetated
buffer strip, preferably planted with native plant species, which shall be
maintained or restored around the periphery of the area in question. The width
of the buffer strip shall be as follows:
         a.   Twenty five feet (25') for a tributary length of two hundred
fifty feet (250') or less.
         b.   Fifty feet (50') for a tributary length greater than two hundred
fifty feet (250') and less than five hundred feet (500').
         c.   Seventy five feet (75') for a tributary length over five hundred
feet (500').
Note: The tributary length is the maximum length of the project limits to the
sensitive area or the length from a drainage divide to the sensitive area.
      2.   The minimum setback shall be measured between the ordinary high
water mark of streams, lakes and ponds, or the edge of wetlands, or within
designated depressional areas. In no case shall the setback be less than the
boundary of the 100-year floodway as defined by FEMA. These setback
requirements do not apply to a stream in a culvert unless the stream is taken
out of the culvert as part of the development activity. If a culvert functions
as a low-flow culvert, where water is intended to periodically flow over it,
the setback requirements apply.
      3.   The following development activities may be permitted, subject to
issuance of a site development permit, within the minimum setback areas only
if, as a practical matter, they cannot be located outside the setback area.
Such development activities will only be approved based upon a report, prepared
by a qualified professional, which demonstrates that they will not adversely
affect water quality; destroy, damage or disrupt significant habitat area;
adversely affect drainage and/or stormwater retention capabilities; adversely
affect flood conveyance and storage; lead to unstable earth conditions; create
erosion hazards; or be materially detrimental to any other property in the area
of the subject property or to the City as a whole, including the loss of open
space or scenic vistas:
         a.   Minor improvements such as walkways, benches, comfort stations,
informational displays, directional signs, footbridges, observation decks, and
docks;
         b.   The maintenance, repair, replacement, and reconstruction of
existing utilities, highways and bridges and electrical transmission and
telecommunication lines, poles, and towers; and
         c.   The establishment and development of public and private parks and
recreation areas, outdoor education areas, historic natural and scientific
areas, game refuges, fish and wildlife improvement projects, game bird and
animal farms, wildlife preserves and public boat launching ramps.
      4.   Review of the proposed development activity within the minimum
setback area will consider the following:
         a.   Only limited filling and excavating necessary for the development
of public boat launching ramps, swimming beaches, or the development of park
shelters or similar structures is allowed. The development and maintenance of
roads, parking lots and other impervious surfaces necessary for permitted uses
are allowed only on a very limited basis, and where no alternate location
outside of the setback area is available.
         b.   Land surface modification within the minimum setback shall be
permitted for the development of stormwater drainage swales between the
developed area of the site (including a stormwater detention facility on the
site) and a stream, lake or pond, or wetland. Detention basins within the
setback are generally discouraged unless it can be shown that resultant
modifications will not impair water quality, habitat, or flood storage
functions.
         c.   No filling or excavating within wetlands is permitted except to
install piers for the limited development of walkways and observation decks.
Walkways and observation decks should avoid high quality wetland areas, and
should not adversely affect natural areas designated in the Illinois Natural
Areas Inventory or the habitat of rare or endangered species.
         d.   Wetland areas occupied by the development of decks and walkways
must be mitigated by an equal area of wetland habitat improvement.
         e.   (1)   Modification of degraded wetlands for purposes of
stormwater management is permitted where the quality of the wetland is improved
and total wetland acreage is preserved. Where such modification is permitted,
wetlands shall be protected from the effects of increased stormwater runoff by
measures such as detention or sedimentation basins, vegetated swales and buffer
strips, and sediment and erosion control measures on adjacent developments. The
direct entry of storm sewers into wetlands shall be avoided. Environmental
impact analysis of wetland modification may be required in accordance with
section
14-8A-8 of this article.
            (2)   An applicant for a site development permit (see section
14-8A-5 of this article) must stabilize areas left exposed after land surface
modification with vegetation normally associated with that stream or wetland.
The planting of native riparian vegetation is recommended as the preferred
stabilization measure. Other techniques should be used only when and where
vegetation fails to control erosion. The preferred alternative is riprap, using
natural rock materials where practicable, installed on eroding bank areas in a
manner that provides interstitial space for vegetative growth and habitat for
macro invertebrates and other stream organisms. Lining of the stream channel
bottom is not permitted.
            (3)   The applicant shall minimize access to the applicant’s
proposed development activity within all or part of the conservation areas
where such access could adversely affect the stream, lake, pond, wetland, or
related environmentally sensitive areas.
   E.   Site Development Plan:
      1.   A site development plan must be prepared for any proposed
development within, or partly within, the conservation areas and must indicate:
         a.   Dimension and area of the parcel, showing also the vicinity of
the site in sufficient detail to enable easy location, in the field, of the
site for which the site development permit is sought, and including the
boundary line, underlying zoning, a legend, a scale, and a north arrow. This
requirement may be satisfied by the submission of a separate vicinity map;
         b.   Location of any existing and proposed structures;
         c.   Location of existing or proposed on-site sewage systems or
private water supply systems;
         d.   Location of any perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond,
and its ordinary high water mark;
         e.   Location and landward limit of all wetlands;
         f.   Location of setback lines as defined in this article;
         g.   Location of the 100-year floodway and floodplain limits;
         h.   Location of existing or future access roads;
         i.   Specifications and dimensions of streams, wetlands or other water
areas proposed for alterations;
         j.   Cross-sections and calculations indicating any changes in flood
storage volumes; and
         k.   Such other information as reasonably requested by City.
      2.   The applicant shall present evidence, prepared by a qualified
professional engineer, that demonstrates that the proposed development activity
will not endanger health and safety, including danger from the obstruction or
diversion of flood flow. The developer shall also show, by submitting
appropriate calculations and resource inventories, that the proposed
development activity will not substantially reduce natural floodwater storage
capacity, destroy valuable habitat for aquatic or other flora and fauna,
adversely affect water quality or groundwater resources, increase stormwater
runoff velocity so that water levels on other lands are substantially raised or
the danger from flooding increased, or adversely impact any other natural
stream, floodplain, or wetland functions, and is otherwise consistent with the
intent of this article.
   F.   Geologic And Soil Report: The site proposed for development shall be
investigated to determine the soil and geologic characteristics, including soil
erosion potential. A report, prepared by a licensed professional engineer,
geoscientist, or soil scientist experienced in the practice of geologic and
soil mechanics, shall be submitted with every application for land development
within the conservation areas. This report shall include a description of soil
type and stability of surface and subsurface conditions. Any area that the
investigation indicates as being subject to geologic or soil hazards shall not
be subjected to development, unless the engineer or soil scientist can
demonstrate conclusively that these hazards can be overcome.
   G.   Hydrologic Controls/Drainage Control Plan:
      1.   A drainage control plan that describes the hydraulic characteristics
of on-site and nearby watercourses as well as the proposed drainage plan,
prepared by a registered professional engineer experienced in hydrology and
hydraulics, shall be submitted with each application for land development
within the conservation areas. Unless otherwise noted, the following
restrictions, requirements and standards shall apply to all development within
the conservation areas:
         a.   Natural open-channel drainageways shall be preserved; and
         b.   Runoff from areas of concentrated impervious cover (e.g., roofs,
driveways, streets, patios. etc.) shall be collected and transported to a
drainageway (preferably a natural drainageway) with sufficient capacity to
accept the discharge without undue erosion or detrimental impact. Vegetated
drainage swales are preferred over conveyances constructed of concrete or other
manufactured materials.
      2.   The drainage control plan shall identify appropriate measures, such
as recharge basins and detention/retention basins, which will limit the
quantitative and qualitative effects of stormwater runoff to pre-development
conditions.
   H.   Site Grading And Excavation Plan: This subsection applies to the extent
that grading and excavation and erosion control plans which satisfy the
following requirements are not already required by a jurisdiction.
      1.   A site grading and excavation plan, prepared by a registered
professional engineer, trained and experienced in civil engineering, shall be
submitted with each application for a site development permit and shall include
the following:
         a.   Details of the existing terrain and drainage pattern with one
foot (1') contours;
         b.   Proposed site contours at one foot (1') intervals;
         c.   Dimensions, elevation and contours of grading, excavation and
fill. Slopes of all drainage swales shall be a minimum of two percent (2%)
through the side and rear yard drainage easements;
         d.   A description of methods to be employed in disposing of soil and
other material that is removed from allowable grading and excavation sites,
including location of the disposal site if on the property;
         e.   A schedule showing when each stage of the project will be
completed, including the total area of soil surface to be disturbed during each
stage, and estimated starting and completion dates. The schedule shall be
prepared so as to limit, to the shortest possible period, the time soil is
exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to initiation
of the improvements; and
         f.   A detailed description of the revegetation and stabilization
methods to be employed, to be prepared in conjunction with the landscape plan
per subsection I of this section. This description should include locations of
erosion control measures such as sedimentation basins, straw bales, diversion
swales, etc.
      2.   The grading and excavation plan must be consistent with all the
provisions of this article.
      3.   Unless otherwise provided in this article, the following
restrictions, requirements and standards shall apply to all development within
the district:
         a.   Every effort shall be made to develop the site in such a manner
so as to minimize the alteration of the natural topography;
         b.   No grading, filling, cleaning, clearing, terracing or excavation
of any kind shall be initiated until final engineering plans are approved and
the site development permit is granted by the City; and
         c.   The depositing of any excavation, grading or clearing material
within a stream, lake, pond or wetland area shall be prohibited.
      4.   In addition to locating all site improvements on the subject
property to minimize adverse impacts on the stream, lake, pond, or wetland, the
applicant shall install a berm, curb, or other physical barrier during
construction and following completion of the project, where necessary, to
prevent direct runoff and erosion from any modified land surface into a stream,
lake, pond, or wetland. All parking and vehicle circulation areas should be
located as far as possible from a stream, lake, pond, or wetland.
      5.   The City may limit development activity in or near a stream, lake,
pond, or wetland to specific months and to a maximum number of continuous days
or hours in order to minimize adverse impacts. Also, the City may require that
equipment be operated from only one side of a stream, lake, or pond in order to
minimize bank disruption. Other development techniques, conditions, and
restrictions may be required in order to minimize adverse impacts on streams,
lakes, ponds or wetlands, and on any related areas not subject to development
activity.
   I.   Natural Vegetation Buffer Strip Required; Vegetation And Revegetation/
Landscape Plan:
      1.   To minimize erosion, stabilize the stream bank, protect water
quality, maintain water temperature at natural levels, preserve fish and
wildlife habitat, screen manmade structures, and preserve aesthetic values of
the natural watercourse and wetland areas, a natural vegetation strip shall be
maintained along the edge of the stream, lake, pond or wetland. The natural
vegetation strip shall be as described in subsection D of this section and
shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark of a perennial or
intermittent stream, lake or pond and the edge of the wetland.
      2.   Within the natural vegetation strip, trees and shrubs may be
selectively pruned or removed for harvest of merchantable timber, to achieve a
filtered view of the water body from the principal structure and for reasonable
private access to the stream, lake, pond, or wetland. Said pruning and removal
activities shall ensure that a live root system stays intact to provide for
stream bank stabilization and erosion control.
      3.   A landscape plan, prepared by a professional, shall be submitted
with each site development permit application for development activity within
the conservation areas and contain the following:
         a.   A plan describing the existing vegetative cover of the property
and showing those areas where the vegetation will be removed as part of the
proposed construction; and
         b.   A plan describing the proposed revegetation of disturbed areas
specifying the materials to be used.
      4.   The vegetation must be planned in such a way that access for stream
maintenance purposes shall not be prevented.

14-8A-7: WATERCOURSE RELOCATION AND MINOR MODIFICATIONS:
   A.   When Permitted:
      1.   Watercourse relocation or modification is generally not permitted
because these activities are not usually consistent with the purposes of this
article. Under certain circumstances, relocation and minor modification may be
permitted through a site development permit where certain problems can be
mitigated by relocation and/or minor modification, specifically when:
         a.   Off-site hydrologic conditions are causing erosion, flooding and
related problems; or
         b.   On-site soil and geologic conditions are resulting in unstable
conditions that pose hazards to life, health, and existing structures or
property; or
         c.   The quality of previously modified or relocated streams can be
improved through restoration; or
         d.   Officially adopted stormwater management plans call for placement
of detention or retention facilities in a stream; or
         e.   Public utilities, including sanitary sewers, pipelines, and
roadways, require stream crossing or relocation where there are not practical
alternatives.
      2.   Modification of watercourses as a convenience for site design
purposes is not permitted.
   B.   Conditions And Restrictions For Permitting Stream Modification: Stream
modification, when permitted, is subject to the following conditions and
restrictions:
      1.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions must be
significantly improved by the modification. No significant habitat area may be
destroyed;
      2.   The amount of flow and velocity of a stream is not to be increased
or decreased as the stream enters or leaves a subject property, unless this
reflects an improvement over previous conditions in terms of reduced flooding,
reduced erosion, or enhanced low-flow conditions;
      3.   Prior to diverting water into a new channel, a qualified
professional approved by the Administrator shall inspect the stream
modification and issue a written report to the City that the modified stream
complies with the requirements of subsection C of this section; and
      4.   Stream channel enlargement, or other modifications that would
increase conveyance, shall not be permitted if the intended purpose is to
accommodate development activities in the floodplain.
   C.   Required Contents Of Plan: Stream relocation may be permitted in
accordance with a stream relocation plan that provides for:
      1.   The creation of a natural meander pattern, pools, riffles, and
substrate;
      2.   The formation of gentle side slopes (at least 3 feet horizontally
per 1 foot vertically), including installation of erosion control features;
      3.   The utilization of natural materials wherever possible;
      4.   The planting of vegetation normally associated with streams,
including primarily native riparian vegetation;
      5.   The creation of spawning and nesting areas wherever appropriate;
      6.   The re-establishment of the fish population wherever appropriate;
      7.   The restoration of water flow characteristics compatible with fish
habitat areas, wherever appropriate;
      8.   The filling and revegetation of the prior channel;
      9.   A proposed phasing plan, specifying time of year for all project
phases;
      10.   Plans for sediment and erosion control; and
   11    Establishment of a low-flow channel that reflects the conditions of a
natural stream,
   D.   Criteria For Permitting Armoring Of Channels And Banks: Armoring in the
form of bulkheads, riprap or other materials or devices is not permitted except
in accordance with the following:
      1.   Significant erosion cannot be prevented in any other way, and the
use of vegetation and gradual bank slopes has not sufficiently stabilized the
shoreline or bank;
      2.   The bulkhead or other device is not placed within a wetland, or
between a wetland and a lake or pond;
      3.   The bulkhead, riprap or other device will minimize the transmittal
of wave energy or currents to other properties; and
      4.   The change in the horizontal or vertical configuration of the land
must be kept to a minimum. Where permission to install bulkheads or other
armoring devices is requested as part of the site development permit
application, documentation and certification pertaining to the items above must
be submitted.
   E.   Criteria For Permitting The Use Of Culverts: Culverts are not permitted
in streams except in accordance with the following:
      1.   Where a culvert is necessary for creating access to a property. Use
of culverts as a convenience, in order to facilitate general site design, is
not to be considered;
      2.   The culvert must allow passage of fish inhabiting the stream and
accommodate the 100-year flood event without increasing upstream flooding,
except where a restricting culvert is desirable as part of an overall
stormwater and floodwater management plan;
      3.   The culvert must be maintained free of debris and sediment to allow
free passage of water, and if applicable, fish; and
      4.   The stream bottom should not be significantly widened for the
placement of a culvert as this increases siltation. If multiple culverts must
be installed, one culvert should be at the level of the bottom of the stream
and the others at or above normal water elevation.
   F.   Criteria For Permitting On-Stream Impoundments: Impoundment of streams
is not permitted except in accordance with the following:
      1.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing regional stormwater detention, flood control, or public recreation;
      2.   The impoundment will not prevent the upstream migration of
indigenous fish species;
      3.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream
watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the
input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants;
      4.   Impoundments without permanent low-flow pools are preferred, except
where a permanent pool is necessary to achieve the intended benefits of the
impoundment (e.g., recreation or water quality mitigation); and
      5.   Impoundment design shall include gradual bank slopes, appropriate
bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin.

All developments shall conform to the requirements set forth in 520 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 10/11, which states that a consultation with the department
shall be undertaken to evaluate whether actions proposed by the development are
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed endangered or threatened
species or are likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of
the designated essential habitat of such species. Final disposition of any
disagreement not resolved by nonlocal laws, ordinances, etc., will be made by
the City Council.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-8A-11: SECURITY AND INDEMNIFICATION:
   A.   Security: The applicant may be required to file with the City a letter
of credit or other improvement security satisfactory to the City and in an
amount deemed sufficient by the Administrator to ensure compliance with any
aspect of this article; to cover all costs of improvements, landscaping, or
maintenance of improvements and landscaping, for such period as specified by
the City, and engineering and inspection costs; and to cover the cost of
failure of repair of improvements installed on the site.
   B.   Indemnification: Prior to issuance of a construction permit, the

The City Council shall not grant a variance for a project from the provisions
of this title unless the variance is consistent with the purpose of this title
(section
14-1-1) and meets the following standards based upon substantial evidence
submitted at the hearing:
   A.   The variance will not increase measurably the probability of flood
damage to insurable structures.
   B.   The variance requested is the minimum required considering each of the
following statements of underlying intent of this title and there are no means
other than the requested variance by which the alleged hardships can be avoided
or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit the reasonable continuation of the
development:
      1.   Detention of stormwater shall also contribute to the improvement of
the quality of stormwater runoff.
      2.   The volume of detention storage provided in open air vegetated
facilities is maximized, consistent with other land use site constraints
including zoning requirements essential for the proposed development.
      3.   Conveyance of stormwater from the project shall not increase peak
discharges from existing off- site conveyance facilities beyond design capacity
for any storm event from the 2-year to the 100-year flood frequency.
      4.   High quality natural areas shall be preserved on the site,
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, stands of native
trees, existing wetlands, natural floodplain storage or other valuable
environmental and biological resources.
   C.   The variance is not requested solely for the purpose of increasing the
density of the development nor impervious areas on the site.
   D.   The variance is not requested solely as a result of economic hardship.
   E.   If applicable, the variance is required due to unique, natural
topographical features of the site.
   F.   The applicant's circumstances are not self-imposed.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-10-6:   ADMINISTRATOR RECOMMENDATIONS:
The Administrator or his designee shall review the application for a variance
and present his written recommendations to the City Council at the public
hearing. The written recommendations shall be accompanied by written findings
of fact with respect to each of the considerations set forth in section
14-10-5 of this chapter, with citations to the evidence taken at the public
hearing.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-10-7:   COUNCIL DECISION:
The City Council shall grant the variation, grant the variation with
modifications or conditions, or deny the variation in writing within forty five
(45) days of the public hearing, but in the event the City Council does not act
as aforesaid, then the application is denied.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-10-8:   CONDITIONS OF VARIANCE:
   A.   A variance less than or different from that requested may be granted
when the record supports the applicant’s right to some relief, but not to the
relief requested.
   B.   In granting a variance, the City Council may impose such specific
conditions and limitations concerning any matter relating to the purposes and
objectives of this title on the applicant as may be necessary or appropriate.
   C.   Whenever any variance is granted subject to any condition or limitation
to be met by the applicant, upon meeting such conditions, the applicant shall
file evidence to that effect with the Administrator.

14-11-3: Discount For Older Properties
14-11-4: Common Regional Detention Basins
14-11-5: Procedures
14-11-1: FEE ESTABLISHED; RESTRICTIONS:
All single-family residential developments under five (5) acres in size and all
other development under one acre in size may pay a fee of one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00) for each acre-foot of detention which would be required
under this title rather than installing detention facilities on the property,
unless specifically directed to do otherwise by the Administrator or his
designee. The City also shall have the option, for larger properties, of
requiring a fee of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for each acre-
foot of detention needed in lieu of the applicant building a basin on-site,
provided the property will discharge stormwater to the City’s storm sewer
system, and the applicant can demonstrate that the redevelopment will not
increase the risk to downstream properties of flooding. Fee- in-lieu solely due
to financial constraints is not allowed. In addition, a redevelopment project
requesting fee-in-lieu of detention must demonstrate a net benefit in water
quality will be realized. The one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000.00) fee may
be adjusted yearly by the Construction Cost Index (CCI).
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-11-2: COST ESTIMATE:
The applicant may provide the City with a detailed, verifiable cost estimate
for actually providing the required storage. If the Administrator or his
designee concurs with the cost estimate, the fee set for fee in-lieu of
detention will be determined by the lesser of the one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00) per acre-foot or part thereof or the verifiable cost of providing
the required storage.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-11-3: DISCOUNT FOR OLDER PROPERTIES:
To encourage redevelopment of properties that have been within the City limits
for a minimum of fifteen (15) years, the City Council may allow a discount of
up to ninety percent (90%) for projects if there is no increase in impervious
area between the existing development and the proposed redevelopment.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
14-11-4: COMMON REGIONAL DETENTION BASINS:
In instances where regional benefits and economics of scale can be achieved, it
is encouraged for adjacent property owners to utilize a common regional
detention basin. Special fee districts may be established for areas where a
regional stormwater management plan has been approved by the City Council. Fee-
in-lieu of detention for the detention volume required for the 2-year 24-hour
storm shall require a variance for sites with aggregate development or re-
development greater than twenty (20) acres subsequent to the effective date
hereof unless tributary to a regional stormwater management system approved by
the City Council.
(Ord. 2421, 6-24-2014, eff. 6-24-2014)
