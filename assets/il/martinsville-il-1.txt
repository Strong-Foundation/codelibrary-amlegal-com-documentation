EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with
the best accepted practice for codification. Each section if self-identifying
as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02 indicates that the
code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code
2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter numbers appear left of
the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal.
The section number appears to the right of the decimal. As another example,
408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 408 (or the
8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
   With this number system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between consecutively numbered sections. For example,
newly created 660.041, 660.042 and 660.043 follow 660.04 and precede 660.05 to
be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter which was ordained by the ordinance adopting these Codified
Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

202.01 DESIGNATION; CITATION; HEADINGS.
   (a)   These Codified Ordinances, which consist of all ordinances and
resolutions of a general and permanent nature of the City, revised, codified,
arranged, numbered and consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and
sections, shall be known and designated as the Codified Ordinances of
Martinsville, Illinois, 1990, for which designation "Codified Ordinances" may
be substituted. Code, title, chapter and section headings do not constitute any
part of the law as contained in the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   All references to codes, titles, chapters and sections are to such
components of the Codified Ordinances unless otherwise specified. Any component
code may be referred to and cited by its name, such as the "Traffic Code."
Sections may be referred to and cited by the designation "section" followed by
the number, such as "Section 202.01."
202.02 AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS; NUMBERING.
   (a)   The Codified Ordinances of Martinsville, Illinois, 1990, may be
amended or supplemented at any time and, when any amendment or supplement is
adopted in such form as to indicate the intention of Council to make the same a
part thereof, such amendment or supplement shall be incorporated in, and deemed
a part of, the Codified Ordinances, so that a reference to the Codified
Ordinances shall be understood and construed as including the Codified
Ordinances of Martinsville, Illinois, 1990, and any and all such amendments and
supplements.
   (b)   All amendments and supplements enacted as a part of the Codified
Ordinances shall be integrated therewith by following the form of arrangement
and plan set forth in the original Codified Ordinances as follows: each Code
shall be subdivided into titles and/or chapters, each title shall be subdivided
into chapters, and each chapter shall be subdivided into sections, which shall
be numbered in accordance with the decimal numbering system. The numbering of
all sections, except penalty sections, shall be consecutive within each chapter
commencing with the first section of Chapter 202, which shall be numbered
202.01, the first "2" signifying Code 2, and the two figures "02" before the
decimal signifying the chapter within the Code, and the two figures "01" after
the decimal signifying the first section in Chapter 202 of the Code. Penalty
sections shall be designated “99” and shall be the last section of a chapter.
   (c)   When preparing an amendment or a supplement to this Code, the
codifier, meaning the person, agency, or organization authorized to prepare the
amendment or supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances
and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary
to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections
and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in such catchlines, headings and titles;
      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other subdivision numbers;
      (4)   Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to
"this chapter," “this article,” “this division,” etc. as the case may be, or to
“sections               to                 ” inserting section numbers to
indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the
ordinance incorporated into the Code; and
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections or the alphabetical arrangement of new
chapters inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any
change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the
supplement or already embodied in the Code.
(Ord. 2018-07-2. Passed 7-11-18.)
202.03 DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION.
   In the construction of the Codified Ordinances, the following rules and
definitions shall control, except those that are inconsistent with the manifest
intent of Council as disclosed in a particular provision, section or chapter:

City adopting the Codified Ordinances of Martinsville, Illinois, 1990, in

   The fiscal year of the City shall commence on the day established by law for
the annual election of Municipal officers.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 1)
208.02 ANNUAL APPROPRIATION ORDINANCE.
   Council shall, within the first quarter of each fiscal year, pass an annual
appropriation ordinance. In such ordinance Council:
   (a)   May appropriate such sums of money as are deemed necessary to defray
all necessary expenses and liabilities of the City; and
   (b)   Shall specify the objects and purposes for which appropriations are
made and the amount appropriated for each object or purpose. Except as
otherwise provided, no further appropriations shall be made at any time within
the fiscal year, unless a proposition to make each additional appropriation has
first been sanctioned by a petition signed by electors of the City numbering
more than fifty percent of the votes cast for the candidates for Mayor at the
last preceding general Municipal election at which the Mayor was elected, or by
a majority of those voting on the question at a general State or Municipal
election duly called therefor.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 2)
208.03 EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS.
   (a)   Neither Council nor any department of the City shall add to the
Municipal expenditures provided for in the annual appropriation ordinance in
any fiscal year. No expenditure for an improvement to be paid for out of the
General Fund of the Municipality shall exceed, in any fiscal year, the amount
provided for that improvement in the annual appropriation ordinance.
   (b)   However, nothing contained in this section shall prevent Council, by a
two-thirds vote, from making additional appropriations for the purpose of
making improvements or restorations caused by any casualty or accident
happening after an annual appropriation ordinance is passed, or from making
additional appropriations necessary to meet any emergency happening after and
unforseen at the time of the passing of the annual appropriation ordinance. For
the purpose of providing for such additional appropriations, Council, by a two-
thirds vote, may authorize the Mayor to borrow the amount of money necessary
therefor, for a time not to exceed beyond the close of the next fiscal year.
The sum borrowed and the interest thereon shall be added to the amount
authorized to be raised in the next general tax levy and embraced therein.
"Emergency," as used in this section, means a condition requiring immediate
action to suppress or prevent the spread of disease or to prevent or remove
imminent danger to persons or property.
   (c)   If a judgment is obtained against the City, the Mayor may borrow a
sufficient amount to pay the judgment for a time not to extend beyond the close
of the next fiscal year. The sum borrowed and the interest thereon shall, in
like manner, be added to the amount authorized to be raised in the general tax
levy of the next year and embraced therein.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 3)
208.04 CONTRACTS; LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.
   No contract shall be made by Council or by any committee or member thereof,
and no expense shall be incurred by any officer or department of the City,
whether or not the object of the expenditure has been ordered by Council,
unless an appropriation has been previously made concerning such contract or
expense. Any contract made or expense incurred in violation of this section
shall be null and void as to the Municipality, and no money belonging thereto
shall be paid on account thereof. However, pending the passage of the annual
appropriation ordinance for any fiscal year, Council may authorize department
heads or other separate agencies of the Municipality to make necessary
expenditures for the support thereof upon the basis of the appropriations for
the preceding year.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 4)
208.05 PAYMENT OF WARRANTS.
   (a)   Except for ACH (Automatic Clearing House) payments drawn on a city
bank account for payroll direct deposit purposes, all warrants drawn upon the
City Treasurer must be signed by at least two of the Mayor, the City Clerk, or
the City Treasurer and shall state the particular appropriation to which the
warrant is chargeable and the person to whom payable. No money shall be paid
otherwise than upon such warrant so drawn, except as otherwise provided.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 5)
   (b)   No warrant payable on demand shall be drawn upon the City Treasurer or
against any fund in his or her possession unless, at the time of the drawing,
there is sufficient money in the appropriate fund, in the hands of the City
Treasurer, to pay the warrant. (1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 6)
(Ord. 2021-6-3. Passed 6-23-21; Ord. 2023-6-3. Passed 6-14-23.)
208.06 TAX ANTICIPATION WARRANTS.
   (a)   Whenever the City does not have sufficient money in its treasury to
meet all necessary expenses and liabilities, including expenses for building
purposes, Council may issue and sell warrants drawn against and in anticipation
of taxes already levied for the particular funds from which such expenses and
liabilities may be paid, to the extent of seventy-five percent of the total
amount of such taxes. Tax anticipation warrants drawn and issued under this
section shall show, on their face, that they are payable in the numerical order
of their issuance solely from anticipated taxes when such anticipated taxes are
collected and not otherwise. Warrants shall be received by any collector of
taxes in payment of the taxes against which such warrants are issued, and the
taxes against which such warrants are drawn shall be set apart and held for
payment of the same.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 7)
   (b)   Each warrant issued under subsection (a) hereof may be made payable at
the time fixed in the warrant and shall bear interest, payable only out of
taxes against which it is drawn, at the rate of six percent annually from the
date of its issuance until paid or until notice is given by publication, in a
newspaper or otherwise, that the money for its payment is available and that it
will be paid on presentation. However, a lower rate of interest may be
specified in the warrant, in which case the interest shall be computed and paid
at the lower rate.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 8)
208.07 LEVY AND COLLECTION OF TAXES.
   (a)   The Council shall, on or before the last Tuesday in December in each
year, ascertain the total amount of appropriations legally made for all
corporate purposes to be collected from the tax levy of that fiscal year. Then,
by an ordinance specifying, in detail, the purposes for which the
appropriations have been made and the amount appropriated for each purpose
respectively, Council shall levy taxes, not to exceed the total amount so
ascertained, upon all property subject to taxation in the City, as that
property is assessed and equalized for State and County purposes for the
current year.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 9)
   (b)   The City Clerk shall, immediately after the passage of such tax levy
ordinance, make a certified copy thereof, under the seal of the City, and
shall, pursuant to law, file the same with the County Clerk. No City Clerk
shall fail to file such tax levy ordinance.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 10)
   (c)   The County Treasurer, collecting the tax levied under subsections (a)
and (b) hereof shall settle with and pay over to the City Treasurer, as often
as once every two weeks from the time he or she commences the collection
thereof, all taxes he or she has then collected, until the whole tax collected
is paid over.

thirds vote of all members of Council, make transfers, within any department or
other separate agency of the Municipal government, of sums of money
appropriated for one corporate object or purpose to another corporate object or
purpose. However, no appropriation for any object or purpose shall thereby be
reduced below an amount sufficient to cover all obligations incurred or to be
incurred against such appropriation. Nothing contained in this section shall
deprive Council of the power to provide for and cause to be paid from the funds
of the City any charge imposed by law, without the action of Council, the
payment of which is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(1942 Code Chap. XVI, Sec. 11)
208.09 COMPETITIVE BIDDING.
   (a)   Any work or public improvement which is not to be paid for in whole or
in part by special assessment or special taxation when the expense thereof will
exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), shall be constructed either:
      (1)   By a contract let to the lowest responsible bidder after
advertising for bids in the manner prescribed by ordinance and statutes, except
that any such contract may be entered into by the proper officers without
advertising for bids if authorized by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all council
members then holding office;
      (2)   If authorized by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all the council
members then holding office, the Superintendent shall supervise and cause to be
carried out the construction of the work or other public improvement and shall
employ exclusively for the performance of all manual labor therein, laborers or
artisans who shall be paid by the Municipality per day or hour; and all
material of the value of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) and upward

   (c)   The historical cost of a capital asset shall include the cost of any
subsequent betterment but exclude the cost of repairs. Betterments, unlike
repairs, either enhance the functionality of a capital asset (i.e.,
effectiveness or efficiency) or extend a capital asset's expected useful life.

is in compliance with this policy and any other applicable laws.
   (b)   Prerequisites. A member of the covered group of the City shall be
provided the opportunity to attend an open and closed meeting or only one of
such meetings from a remote location if the member meets that following
conditions and a majority of a quorum of the covered body votes to approve the
remote attendance:
      (1)   The member must notify the City Clerk at least twenty-four hours
before the meeting unless advance notice is impractical;
      (2)   The member must meet one of three reasons described herein why he
or she is unable to physically attend the meeting, including either: (a) that

member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the business of the
City; or (c) the member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency;
and

   (c)   Voting Procedure. After roll call, a vote of the covered body shall be
taken, considering the prerequisites set forth in subsection (b) hereof, on
whether to allow an off-site board member to participate remotely. All of the
members physically present are permitted to vote on whether remote
participation will be allowed. A vote may be taken to permit remote
participation for a stated series of meetings if the same reason applies in
each case. Otherwise, a vote must be taken to allow each remote participation.
   (d)   Quorum and Vote Required. A quorum must be established by members
physically present at any meeting before it can be considered whether to allow
a member to participate in the meeting remotely. A vote of a majority of a
quorum shall be necessary to decide the issue. For the meeting to continue
there shall always need to be a quorum physically present.
   (e)   Minutes. The member participating remotely shall be considered an off-
site participant and counted as present by means of video or audio conference,
for that meeting of the members and is allowed to participate. The meeting
minutes of the City shall also reflect and state specifically whether each
member is physically present, present by video, or present by audio means.

votes of the members of the body, unless attendance at the regular meeting
location is not feasible due to the disaster, including the issued disaster
declaration, in which case the City must make alternative arrangements and

302.05 IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION ELEMENTS.
   (a)   Identification of Relevant Red Flags. The City has considered the
guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from the Federal
Trade Commission's Identity Theft Rules and has reviewed the City's past
history with instances of identity theft, if any. The City hereby determines
that the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of this program
given the relative size of the City and the limited nature and scope of the
services that the City provides to its citizens:
      (1)   The presentation of suspicious documents.
         A.   Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered
or forged.
         B.   The photograph or physical description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the
identification.
         C.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
         D.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the City, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
         E.   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives
the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
      (2)   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change.
         A.   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the City. For example:
            1.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report
or credit reporting agency ID check response; or
            2.   The Social Security number has not been issued, or is listed
on the Social Security Administration's death master file.
         B.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the Social
Security number range and date of birth.
         C.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the City. For example:
            1.   The address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application; or
            2.   The phone number on an application is the same as the number
provided on a fraudulent application.
         D.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly
associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the City. For example:
            1.   The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail
drop, or a prison; or
            2.   The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
         E.   The Social Security number provided is the same as that submitted
by other persons opening an account or other customers.
         F.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers.
         G.   The person opening the covered account or the customer fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
         H.   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the City.
         I.   If the City uses challenge questions, the person opening the
covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer
report.
      (3)   The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a
covered account.
         A.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the City receives a request for the addition of authorized users on
the account.
         B.   A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated
with known fraud patterns. For example: the customer fails to make the first
payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
         C.   A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities.
         D.   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
         E.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although usage of utility products or services continues in connection with the
customer's covered account.
         F.   The City is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
         G.   The City is notified of unauthorized usage of utility products or
services in connection with a customer's covered account.
      (4)   Notice of possible identity theft.
         A.   The City is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a
law enforcement authority, or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
      (5)   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers (if such agencies or providers are used
by the City):
         A.   A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report
or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency.
         B.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in
response to a request for a consumer report.
         C.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address
discrepancy, as defined in § 681.1(b) of the Federal Trade Commission's
Identity Theft Rules.
         D.   A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
            1.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
            2.   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
            3.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
            4.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse
of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
   (b)   Detection of Red Flags.
      (1)   The employees of the City that interact directly with customers on
a day-to-day basis shall have the initial responsibility for monitoring the
information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider in connection with the opening of new accounts and the
modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red
flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that all employees who might
be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are properly trained such
that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in
this program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction. An employee who is not sufficiently trained to
recognize the red flags identified in this program shall not open a new account
for any customer, modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer
with access to information in an existing account without the direct
supervision and specific approval of a management employee. Management
employees shall be properly trained such that they can recognize the relevant
red flags identified in this program and exercise sound judgment in connection
with the response to any unresolved red flags that may present themselves in
connection with the opening of a new account or with modifying or accessing of
an existing account. Management employees shall be responsible for making the
final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
      (2)   The program administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may
apply for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the
prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility
service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer
with the application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in
which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-
party service provider shall be maintained. Such policy shall be generally
consistent with the spirit of the Customer Identification Program rules (31 CFR
§ 103.121) implementing Section 326(a) of the USA Patriot Act but need not be
as detailed. The program administrator may, but is not required to, maintain a
relationship with a credit reporting agency to perform identity verification
services. The program administrator shall establish from time to time a written
policy setting forth the manner in which customers with existing accounts shall
establish their identity before being allowed to make modifications to or
otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
   (c)   Response to Detected Red Flags.
      (1)   If the responsible employees of the city as set forth in the
previous subsection are unable, after making a good faith effort, to form a
reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a customer attempting to
open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing account based on
the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider, the City shall not open the new account or modify or
otherwise provide access to the existing account as the case may be.
Discrimination in respect to the opening of new accounts or the modification or
access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by employees of the City and
shall be grounds for immediate dismissal.
      (2)   The program administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an
unresolved red flag situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating
factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security
incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a
notice that a customer has provided account information to a fraudulent
individual or website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity
theft when a red flag is detected include:
         A.   Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
         B.   Contacting the customer.
         C.   Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security devices
that permit access to a covered account.
         D.   Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
         E.   Not opening a new covered account.
         F.   Closing an existing covered account.
         G.   Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling a
covered account to a debt collector.
         H.   Notifying law enforcement.
         I.   Determining that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.

302.06 PROGRAM AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY.
   (a)   Initial Risk Assessment - Covered Accounts. Utility accounts for
personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of "covered account" in the Federal Trade Commission's Identity
Theft Rules. Therefore, the City determines that with respect to its
residential utility accounts it offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The
City also performed an initial risk assessment to determine whether the utility
offers or maintains any other accounts for which there are reasonably
foreseeable risks to customers or the utility from identity theft. In making
this determination the City considered the methods it uses to open its
accounts, the methods it uses to access its accounts, and its previous
experience with identity theft, and it concluded that it does not offer or
maintain any such other covered accounts.
   (b)   Program Updates - Risk Assessment. The program, including relevant red
flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually to reflect
changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the
program update include:
      (1)   An assessment of the risk factors identified above.
      (2)   Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or
procedures.
      (3)   Changes in methods of identity theft.
      (4)   Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft.
      (5)   Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions,
alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
   (c)   Training and Oversight. All staff and third-party service providers
performing any activity in connection with one or more covered accounts are to
be provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that
the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed
to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.

   (b)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
limited to:
      (1)   Verbal harassment: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates; or, statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
      (2)   Non-verbal harassment: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls,"
"smacking" or "kissing" noises.
      (3)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      (4)   Physical harassment: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      (5)   Textual/electronic harassment: "sexting" (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email/text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites, like
Facebook and Twitter).
   (c)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person."
(Ord. 2018-1-2. Passed 1-10-18; Ord. 2020-5-1. Passed 5-27-20; Ord. 2021-11- 1.
Passed 11-10-21.)
310.03 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (a)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (b)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
         A.   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality.
         B.   The employee experiencing what she/he believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
      (4)   Allegations of sexual harassment made against an elected official
of the governmental unit by another elected official of a governmental unit. In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the human resources director,
the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
   (c)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
   (d)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.

310.04 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.
   (a)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee's or official's:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy; or
      (2)   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (b)   For purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee's or official's involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   (c)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (d)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, and this policy prohibits
retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule
or regulation; or
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
   (e)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee or in any
other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   (f)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire to
retaliate against a person because she/he has opposed that which she/he
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because she/he has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   (g)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge within 300 days of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 2018-1-2. Passed 1-10-18; Ord. 2018-12-2. Passed 12-12-18; Ord. 2020-5-1.
Passed 5- 27-20; Ord. 2021-11-1. Passed 11-10-21.)
310.05 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or
the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be
subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) per offense,
applicable disciplinary actions or discharge by the municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state
law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a state or federal agency.
(Ord. 2018-1-2. Passed 1-10-18; Ord. 2020-5-1. Passed 5-27-20; Ord. 2021-11-1.
Passed 11-10- 21.)
310.06 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   (a)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
   (b)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State
Police, a State's Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement
official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) against any person
who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

(Ord. 2021-11-1. Passed 11-10-21.)
320.06 REPORTING AND COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   The City encourages all employees, volunteers or contractors to promptly
report any instance of bullying behavior. Early reporting and intervention have
proven to be the most effective method of resolving actual or perceived
incidents of bullying. Therefore, while no fixed reporting period has been
established, prompt reporting of complaints or concerns is encouraged so that
rapid and constructive action can be taken. The City shall make every effort to
stop alleged workplace bullying before it becomes severe or pervasive, but can
only do so with the cooperation of its employees. Reports of bullying will be
treated seriously, and investigated promptly and impartially. The City further
encourages all individuals to whom this policy applies to formally report any
concerns of assault, battery, or other bullying behavior of a criminal nature
to the City Attorney's office. The City Council requires any supervisor who
witnesses bullying, irrespective of reporting relationship or his/her
responsibility to address it, to promptly report this conduct to the Police
Chief or the Mayor. Individuals who believe they have experienced conduct that
they believe violates this policy, or who have concerns about such matter,
should report their complaints or concerns verbally or in writing to his or her
supervisor, or the City Attorney, before the conduct becomes severe or
pervasive. If a verbal report is made, it shall be documented in writing by the
official to whom it is reported. Individuals should not feel obligated to
report their complaints to their immediate supervisor first before bringing the
matter to the attention of one of the other designated City representatives
identified above. The availability of this complaint procedure does not
preclude individuals who believe they are being subjected to bullying conduct
from promptly advising the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome and
requesting that such behavior immediately stop.

CHAPTER 322
Domestic and Sexual Violence Policy
322.01   Purpose of policy.
322.02   Definition.
322.03   Victims’ economic security and safety act (VESSA).
322.04   Policy.
322.01 PURPOSE OF POLICY.
   Domestic violence can permeate the lives and compromise the safety of
employees with tragic, destructive and often fatal results. Domestic violence
occurs within a wide spectrum of relationships, including married and formerly
married couples, couples with children in common, couples who live together or
have lived together, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender couples, and
couples who are dating or who have dated in the past. Domestic violence
represents a pattern of coercive tactics which can include physical,
psychological, sexual, economic and emotional abuse perpetrated by one person
against another in an intimate relationship or in the same household, with the
goal of establishing and maintaining power and control over the victim. In
addition to exacting a tremendous toll from the individuals it directly
affects, domestic violence often spills over into the workplace, compromising
the safety of both victims and co-workers and resulting in lost productivity,
increased health care costs, increased absenteeism, and increased employee
turnover. The City will take appropriate actions to promote safety in the
workplace and respond effectively to the needs of victims of domestic violence.
(Ord. 2021-11-1. Passed 11-10-21.)
322.02 DEFINITION.
   For purposes of this policy and pursuant to the Illinois Victims' Economic
Security and Safety Act (VESSA), the following terms are defined as follows:
   (a)   "Abuser". A person who perpetrates a pattern of coercive tactics which
can include physical, psychological, sexual, economic, and emotional abuse
against an adult intimate partner, with the goal of establishing and
maintaining power and control over the victim.
   (b)   "Domestic Violence". Abuse by a family or household member, as defined
by this policy pursuant to Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of
1986. “Domestic violence” includes sexual assault or stalking.
   (c)   "Employee". A person working for the City for remuneration for
services.
   (d)   "Family or Household Member". For employees with a family or household
member who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence, this means spouse,
parent, son, daughter, other person related by blood or by present or prior
marriage, another person who shares a relationship through a son or daughter,
and persons jointly residing in the same household.
   (e)   "Parent". Biological parent of an employee or an individual who stood
in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a son or daughter as
defined herein.
   (f)   "Son or Daughter". A biological adopted, or foster child, a stepchild,
a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is under
eighteen (18) years of age, or is eighteen (18) years of age or older and
incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.
(Ord. 2021-11-1. Passed 11-10-21.)
322.03 VICTIMS' ECONOMIC SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT (VESSA).
   The person against whom an abuser directs coercive and/or violent acts,
including an employee who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence, or an
employee's family or household member who is a victim of domestic or sexual
violence, and whose interests are not adverse to the employee as it related to
domestic or sexual violence.
(Ord. 2021-11-1. Passed 11-10-21.)
322.04 POLICY.
   (a)   Employee Awareness. The City shall take reasonable actions to educate
employees regarding the effects of domestic violence and methods to report such
violence to authorities. It is the policy of the City that information on
domestic violence and available resources shall be available to employees
through the City Council and by this written policy, which shall be
disseminated to employees.
   (b)   Non-Discriminatory Policy. Non-discriminatory and responsive personnel
policies for victimized employees of the City shall ensure that personnel
policies and procedures do not discriminate against victims of domestic
violence and are responsive to the needs of victims of domestic violence.
      (1)   Illinois law prohibits employers from interfering with,
restraining, or denying the exercise of any right provided under VESSA. This
law requires employers, when given forty-eight (48) hours prior notification,
to allow time off for employed victims of domestic or sexual violence and
employees with a family or household member who is a victim of domestic or
sexual violence, to take unpaid leave to seek medical help, legal assistance,
counseling, safety planning, and other assistance without penalty from the
employer for the employee or the family or household member who is a victim.
      (2)   Illinois law prohibits employers from discriminating against any
employee who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence or any employee who has
a family or household member who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence.
      (3)   An employee who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence, or has
a family or household member who is a victim of domestic or sexual violence and
whose interests are not adverse to the employee as it relates to domestic or
sexual violence, may take unpaid leave from work to address domestic or sexual
violence by:
         A.   Seeking medical attention for, or recovering from, physical or
psychological injuries caused by domestic or sexual violence to the victim;
         B.   Obtaining services from a victim services organization for the
victim;
         C.   Obtaining psychological or other counseling for the victim;
         D.   Participating in safety planning, temporarily or permanently
relocating, or taking other actions to increase the safety of the victim;
         E.   Seeking legal assistance or remedies to ensure the health and
safety of the victim, including preparing for or participating in any civil or
criminal legal proceeding related to or derived from domestic or sexual
violence.
      (4)   The employee shall be entitled to a total of twelve (12) workweeks
of leave during any twelve (12) month period. This policy does not create a
right for an employee to take an unpaid leave that exceeds the unpaid leave
time allowed under, or is in addition to, the unpaid leave time permitted by
the federal Family Medical Leave Act. Leave may be taken intermittently or on a
reduced work schedule. An employee may substitute accumulated paid leave for
unpaid leave; however, the paid leave will count toward the number of workweeks
used for purposes of this policy. The employee shall provide at least forty-
eight (48) hours advance notice of the employee's intention to take leave,
unless providing such notice is not practicable. No action will be taken
against an employee for failing to provide forty-eight (48) hours advance
notice if the employee provides certification that leave was used for the
purposes outlined in Subsection (b)(2) of this Section and can demonstrate that
advance notice was not practicable.
      (5)   During a leave taken pursuant to this policy, the City shall
maintain coverage under its group health plan for the duration of such leave at
the level and under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the
employee had continued in employment for the duration of such leave. If the
employee fails to return from leave, however, the City may recover any premium
costs it paid for such coverage if the reason for the employee not returning is
other than the continuation, recurrence, or onset of domestic or sexual
violence or circumstances beyond the control of the employee. Neither seniority
nor leave benefits will accrue to the employee during unpaid leave.
      (6)   The City, upon request, will assist the employee in determining the
best use of his/her attendance and leave benefits when an employee needs to be
absent as a result of being a victim of domestic violence. If an employee
requests time off to care for and/or assist a family or household member who
has been a victim of domestic violence, the employee's supervisor or the City
Council (or their designee) will evaluate the employee's request for leave for
eligibility under existing law and collective bargaining agreements applicable
to the employee and the attendance rules.
      (7)   The City requires certification from an employee for leave under
this policy. The employee shall certify that the leave is for one of the
purposes enumerated in Section 322.04(b) of this Section. Certification shall
be provided to the employer within a time period set by the employer.
      (8)   The City understands that victims of domestic violence may lack the
required documentation or have difficulty obtaining the required certification
to justify absences without compromising their safety. Therefore, the Mayor or
his designee shall consult with the employee to identify what documentation
she/ he might have, or be able to obtain, that will not compromise his/her
safety related needs and will satisfactorily meet the documentation requirement
of the employer.
      (9)   All information provided to the employer pursuant to notification
and certification requirements of this policy, and the purposes for which leave
may be requested pursuant to this policy, shall be retained in strictest
confidence by the employer, except to the extent that disclosure is requested
or consented to in writing by the employee, or otherwise required by applicable
federal or State law. Reported information shall be kept private to the
greatest extent possible by Federal law, State law, and City policy; however,
information may have to be disclosed pursuant to a subpoena, Illinois Supreme
Court Rules, a court of law, or where otherwise required by law. Where medical
information is received by the City from an employee who is the victim of
domestic violence, such medical information shall be kept confidential.
      (10)   Employees who are victims of domestic violence and who are legally
separated from a covered spouse or civil-union partner, shall be allowed to
make reasonable changes in benefits at any time during the calendar year,
provided the change is requested within thirty (30) days of the separation and
is in accordance with the City policies, rules, and regulations.
      (11)   The City will not make inquiries about a job applicant's current
or past domestic violence victimization, and employment decisions will not be
based on any assumptions about or knowledge of such exposure.
   (c)   Accountability for Employees Who are Abusers. The City will hold
employees, individuals who volunteer services to the City without remuneration
(hereafter "volunteers"), and individuals who contract with the City or work
for contractors of the City (hereafter "contractors"), accountable for engaging
in the following behavior; (i) using City resources to commit an act of
domestic violence; (ii) committing an act of domestic violence from or at the
workplace or from any other location while on official City business; or (iii)
using their job related authority and/or City resources in order to negatively
affect victims and/or assist perpetrators in locating a victim and/or in
perpetrating an act of domestic violence. Any physical assault or threat made
by an employee, volunteer, or contractor, while on City premises, during
working hours, while representing the City, or at a City-sponsored event, is a
serious violation of this policy. This policy applies not only to acts against
employees, but to acts against all other persons. Those found to have violated
this policy will be subject to corrective or disciplinary action, up to and
including discharge.
      (1)   In cases in which the City has found that an employee, volunteer,
or contractor, has threatened, harassed, or abused an intimate partner at the
workplace using City resources such as work time, workplace telephones,
facsimile machines, mail, e-mail or other means, said employee shall be subject
to corrective or disciplinary action.
      (2)   In cases in which the City has verification that an employee,
volunteer, or contractor is responsible for a domestic violence-related
offense, or is the subject of any order of protection, including temporary,
final or out-of-state order, as a result of domestic violence, and said
employee, volunteer or contractor has job functions that include the authority
to take actions that directly impact victims of domestic violence and/or
actions that may protect abusers from appropriate consequences for their
behavior, the Mayor shall determine if corrective action is warranted.
      (3)   In cases in which any employee, volunteer, or contractor
intentionally uses his/her job-related authority and/or intentionally uses City
resources in order to negatively impact a victim of domestic violence, assist
an abuser in locating a victim, assist an abuser in perpetrating acts of
domestic violence, or protect an abuser from appropriate consequences for his/
her behavior, said individual may be subject to corrective or disciplinary
action.

   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the
health, safety and general welfare of citizens of the City. It has come to the
attention of the Mayor and the City Council that the use of non-highway
vehicles on City streets creates a potential traffic hazard for other vehicular
traffic as well as a danger to the occupants of non- highway vehicles. After
consideration of the volume, speed and character of traffic on the City
streets, the City Council has determined that non-highway vehicles may safely
travel on or cross City streets and that the public safety will not be
jeopardized.
   (b)   Therefore, the intent of this chapter is to regulate the use of non-
highway vehicles within the corporate limits of the City as authorized by 625
ILCS 5/11-1426.1.

      (1)   It is unlawful for any person to maintain a public nuisance by

      (2)   No dog shall be deemed vicious if it bites, attacks, or menaces a
trespasser on the property of its owner or harms or menaces anyone who has
tormented or abused it or is a professionally trained dog for law enforcement

      (6)   No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away the
dog.
      (7)   It is unlawful for any person to maintain a public nuisance by
permitting any dangerous dog to leave the premises of its owner when not under
control by leash or other recognized control method.
      (8)   Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the
physically handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police-owned dogs are exempt from
this section; provided, that an attack or injury to a person occurs while the
dog is performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this

animal to leave his or her premises when not under control by leash or other
recognized control methods. Upon the filing of a complaint in the circuit
court, the court, if satisfied that a nuisance may exist, shall grant a
preliminary injunction with bond in such amount as the court may determine
enjoining the defendant from maintaining such nuisance. If the existence of the
nuisance is established, the owner of such dog or other animal shall be in
violation of this section, and, in addition, the court shall enter an order
restraining the owner from maintaining such nuisance and may order that such
dog or other animal be humanely dispatched.
      (10)   Violations; penalties.
            A.   Any person violating or aiding in or abetting the violation of
any provision of this section or resisting, obstructing or impeding the
administrator or any authorized officer in enforcing this section, is guilty of
a petty offense for a first or second offense and shall be fined according to
the provisions of Section
202.99 of this Code, and for a third and subsequent offense is guilty of a
class C misdemeanor. Each day a person fails to comply constitutes a separate
offense. The city attorney upon the report of any violation from the police
department shall cause appropriate proceedings to be instituted in the proper
courts without delay and to be prosecuted in the manner provided by law.
            B.   If the owner of a dog subject to enclosure:
               1.   Fails to maintain or keep the dog in an enclosure;
               2.   The dog inflicts great bodily harm, permanent disfigurement
or permanent physical disability upon any other person or causes the death of

   (b)   Garbage and Debris Defined. As used in this section, "garbage and
debris" means rejected food wastes, including every waste accumulation of
animal, fruit or vegetable matter used or intended for food and such paper as
may necessarily be used for wrapping the same, and all solid wastes, including
garbage, ashes, rubbish, dead animals, paper, sweepings, solid market and
industrial wastes, cans, metalware, broken glass, crockery, dirt, boxes, wood,
grass clippings, abandoned machines and litter of any kind.
   (c)   Responsibilities of Owners, Occupants and Lessees. The owner, occupant
or lessee of any premises in the City shall cause to be removed from such
premises all garbage and debris and shall keep such premises, at all times,
free and clean from any accumulation thereof except when in proper containers
for the garbage collector.
   (d)   Removal by City. The corporate authorities may remove garbage and
debris from private property after ten days written notice is given to the

as a lien against the real estate.
   (e)   Collection of Costs. Upon the removal of garbage and debris from
private property pursuant to this section, the corporate authorities may,
within sixty days after the cost therefor is incurred, file notice of a lien in
the office of the Recorder of Deeds or with the Registrar of Deeds of the
County. The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out a description
of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof, the amount of money
representing the cost incurred or payable for the service and the date when
such cost was incurred by the Municipality. However, the lien of the
Municipality shall not be valid as to any purchaser whose rights in and to such
real estate have arisen subsequent to the removal of the garbage and debris and
prior to the filing of such notice, and the lien of the Municipality shall not
be valid as to any mortgage, judgment creditor or other lienor whose rights in
and to such real estate arise prior to the filing of such notice. Upon payment
of the cost by the owner of such property or by persons interested in such
property, after notice of the lien has been filed, the lien shall be released
by the City or the person in whose name the lien has been filed and the release
may be filed of record as in the case of filing a notice of lien. The lien may
be enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in case of mortgages or mechanics'
liens. A suit to foreclose a lien shall be commenced within two years after the
date of filing of the lien.
(Ord. 4-1-90. Passed 4-4-90.)
   (f)   Exceptions; Screening of Unsightly Materials. In cases where otherwise
unsightly materials would be in violation of this section, but the offending
materials are an integral part of a legitimate, profit-motivated enterprise or
business, then certain exceptions and conditions shall apply. For an exception
to be applicable, the owner, occupant or lessee of the premises shall present
good cause to Council of the importance of the materials, the nature of the
business and to what extent it would be unreasonably burdensome to be in
compliance with this section. Upon a showing of good cause, Council, in its
discretion, may waive the requirements of this section, provided that a fence,
barrier or other enclosure of sufficient height and of appropriate material is
erected and installed so as to completely enclose and bar from outside view the
material. The size, type, style, height and other specifications of the fence,
barrier or other enclosure are subject to prior approval by Council. All costs
of installation and maintenance of the same shall be the sole responsibility of
the owner, occupant or lessee of the premises. The fence shall be maintained in
good and sufficient condition so that it continues to act as a barrier to
outside view of the materials and so that no materials escape from the
premises.
   This subsection shall apply to all premises within the City and within one
and one-half miles of the City upon its effective date, including all pre-
existing conditions. This does not apply to materials that are unhealthy,
unsanitary or unsafe.

the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      (2)   Application Process. The City shall process applications as
follows:
         A.   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         B.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the City fails to
approve or deny the application within ninety days after the submission of a
completed application.
            1.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the City in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
seventy-five days after the submission of a completed application.
            2.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the
ninetieth day after submission of the complete application or the tenth day
after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the City. The receipt of the
deemed approved notice shall not preclude the Citys denial of the permit
request within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         C.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the City fails to approve or

            1.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the City in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
105 days after the submission of a completed application.
            2.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 120th

approved notice shall not preclude the City's denial of the permit request
within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         D.   The City shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
            1.   If the City determines that applicable codes, ordinances or
regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation requirements and
conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            2.   The City shall document the basis for a denial, including the
specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
City denies an application.
            3.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the City
and resubmit the revised application once within thirty days after notice of
denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee.
The City shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty days after
the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit the revised application within thirty days of denial shall require the
application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the City's review period.
            4.   The applicant must notify the City in writing of its intention
to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
            5.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
         E.   Pole Attachment Agreement. Within thirty days after an approved
permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the
City and the applicant shall enter into a master pole attachment agreement,
provided by the City for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole by
the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the City and the applicant shall
enter into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement.
      (3)   Completeness of Application. Within thirty days after receiving an
application, the City shall determine whether the application is complete and
notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the City must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the City fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated
in the City's permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the
City. Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the City sends the notice
of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         A.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the City;
or
         B.   A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated Applications.
         A.   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities
within the jurisdiction of the City shall be allowed, at the applicant's
discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to twenty-five small wireless facilities if the
collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless
facility and substantially the same type of structure.
         B.   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the City may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The City may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application,
      (6)   Duration of Permits.
         A.   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
City makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified
utility pole do not comply with the applicable City codes or any provision,
condition or requirement contained in this chapter.
         B.   If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein,

      (1)   Public Safety Space Reservation. The City may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the City's electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the City reasonably determines
that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      (2)   Installation and Maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      (3)   No Interference with Public Safety Communication Frequencies. The
wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
         A.   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency's communications equipment.
         B.   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCCs regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         C.   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         D.   The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities
on City utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
         A.   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the City utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         B.   For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications
space" 'communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      (6)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable
stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a City
ordinance, written policy adopted by the City, a comprehensive plan or other
written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way,
including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      (7)   Alternate Placements.
         A.   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and
conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that
the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
         B.   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
      (8)   Height Limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. New or
replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         A.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other
than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on
the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located within 300
feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and
that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
City, provided the City may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
         B.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height Exceptions or Variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a waiver from the City Council. The standard for granting the
waiver shall be the same as provided in division (a) of this section “Permitted
Use”.
      (10)   Contractual Design Requirements. The wireless provider shall

wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Undergrounding Regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the

to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation Completion Deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within sixty days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.

office. All bills for service shall be rendered during the month succeeding the
period for which the service is used. All bills shall be paid on or before the
due date.
(Ord. 2016-01-1. Passed 1-13-16.)
1038.18 EQUALIZED PAYMENT PLAN.
   (a)   Availability. Any residential customer may elect to pay a monthly
payment equal to one-twelfth of the average cost of energy services for the
previous 12 months, adjusted for current or anticipated fuel costs and rates.
The customer may be placed on the equalized payment plan during any month of
the year. The account is balanced with each July billing or when service is
disconnected or the customer is removed from the equalized payment plan. The
City reserves the right to cancel the customer's participation in the plan
should the customer fail to pay the equalized payment by the due date of the
monthly bill. The customer may cancel the agreement to participate in this plan
by giving 30 days' written notice to the City and by paying any necessary
billing to make the account current.
   (b)   Payment Determination. Accumulate the number of months and meter
billings to determine the average cost per month per meter on account. Total
the average cost per meter per month for the account. Adjust the average cost
per month to reflect current or anticipated fuel costs and rates. Round upward
to the nearest whole dollar to determine the monthly equalized payment plan.
      (1)   Accumulation of number of months must include at least one year of
billings at the customer's location. Previous customer's billing for the same
location may be used.
      (2)   Meter billings include gas, water, sewer and garbage collection
service, State utility tax and utility surcharge fees.
      (3)   Any customer commencing the equalized payment plan during any month
other than August must pay, before commencing participation in the plan, the
amount by which the total equalized payment plan payments from the prior August
to date (assuming participation) exceeds the total payments actually made
during such period. If more has been paid than the equalized payment plan
payments would have required, the difference shall be credited to the
customer's next billings until fully applied.
   (c)   Adjustments. Equalized payment plan accounts will be mechanically
reviewed and adjusted every 12 months on the anniversary date. The July billing
shall be considered the anniversary date. A new equalized payment plan amount
will be calculated using the last 12 months' history. From the sixth through
the tenth months subsequent to the anniversary date, an audit may be
mechanically processed. Any account which has a debit balance greater than
twice the equalized payment plan payment will be placed on this audit report.
This report will include the following: name, account number, current equalized
payment plan payment amount and status. Payments may be adjusted based upon
review. Any debit balance for the last 12 months' listings will be billed with
the July billing. Any credit balance will be credited toward the customer's
next billings.
   (d)   General. Except for the equalizing of the customer's payments for
service, all other provisions, terms and conditions of the applicable rate
schedule shall continue to be applicable. Where a customer is using more than
one public utility service not at a specified location, the equalized payment
plan must be utilized for all services collectively. The City reserves the
right to designate a budget period other than the normal budget period for
application to customers whose service is seasonal in character. A method of
payment determination applicable to the designated budget period would be
applied.
(Ord. 2016-01-1. Passed 1-13-16.)
1038.19 LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT.

the service on such premises, and the service is furnished to the premises by
the City only upon condition that the named customer(s), occupant(s), user(s)

the City on that day shall be extended to include the next business day that
the Collector's office is open.

   (a)   There is hereby created a service charge in the amount of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) to be assessed and billed by the City to any utility user for
each check received from such user to be applied on a utility bill, which check
is returned unpaid by the bank upon which it is drawn. Such charge shall be
collected from the user in the same manner as collection is made of charges for
utility services. Any payment made by the utility user subsequent to any such
service charge shall be applied first in payment of the service charge; second,
in payment of any penalty assessed by reason of late payment; and finally, to
charges for utility services.
   (b)   Any utility user making payment by check who has two checks returned
unpaid by the bank upon which such checks are drawn within a 12-month period
must make all subsequent payments by cash, certified funds or money order.

consumer of public utility services may seek an adjustment or refund on his
account. If the charges for such service become delinquent, the City Collector
is authorized to commence such procedure. After completion of such procedure,
if a determination is made that liability exists and the account is not paid,
then such service shall be disconnected. Service shall not be reinstated until
all past due bills, late payment fees and reconnection charges are paid in
full.
   (b)   Except as allowed by section 366 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. §
366), no utility service shall be disconnected to any consumer because of
nonpayment of a pre-bankruptcy bill.

1038.23 and shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled.
   (b)   Lien; Notice of Delinquency.
      (1)   Such charges or rates and delinquency charges are liens upon the
real estate upon or for which service is supplied whenever the charges or rates
become delinquent, and the service is furnished to the premises by the City
only upon the condition that the charges or rates and delinquency charges shall
become a lien upon the premises when the charges or rates become delinquent.
      (2)   A lien is created only if the City Collector sends to the owner or
owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the taxpayer's
identification number:
         A.   A copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is
delinquent in paying the charges or rates or other notice sufficient to inform
the owner or owners of record, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification
number, that the charges or rates have become delinquent; and
         B.   A notice that unpaid charges or rates may create a lien upon the
real estate.
   (c)   Notice of Lien.
      (1)   Whenever a bill for public utility services becomes delinquent, and
after the notice of delinquency is sent to the owner or owners of record, the
City Collector shall file with the County Recorder of Deeds a notice of lien
claim. This notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out:
         A.   A description of the real estate sufficient for the
identification thereof;
         B.   The amount of money due for such service; and
         C.   The date when such amount became delinquent.
      (2)   The City Collector shall send a copy of the notice of the lien to
the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the
taxpayer's identification number.
   (d)   Foreclosure of Lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges
shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be
applied to pay the charges and attorneys fees, after deducting costs, as is the
case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill
in equity in the name of the City. The City Attorney is hereby authorized and
directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the City in any court
having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill
becomes delinquent.
   (e)   Legal Action. The City also has the power from time to time to sue the
named customer, occupant, user and owner of the premises in a civil action to
recover the money due for services rendered, plus reasonable attorney's fees,
to be fixed by the court. Whenever a judgment is entered in such civil action,
the foregoing provisions in this section with respect to filing sworn
statements of such delinquencies in the office of the recorder and creating a
lien against the real estate shall not be effective thereafter as to charges or
rates sued upon and no lien shall exist thereafter against the real estate for
the delinquency. A judgment in such civil action operates as a release and
waiver of the lien for the amount of judgment.

or a qualified representative of the City before the same is covered over.
Notification of two regular working days will be required for the inspection of

(Adopting Ordinance)
   (h)   A flat fee is hereby added to the regular utility bill of each unit
owned and/or occupied by each City utility customer. The flat fee is
established at the rate of ten dollars and no cents ($10.00) each for water and
sewer service. This fee shall be billed and payable on a monthly basis along
with the regular utility bill and will be included in the regular utility bill
as a separate item. The City deems this flat fee necessary in order to
accumulate sufficient funds in the Utility Department’s separate account to pay
for emergency repairs and services of the Utility Department.
   (i)   Commencing with the first billing for each customer on or after May 1
of each year, there shall be a 3% increase to the water rate and sewer rate
charge in effect prior to the increase.

1048.04 RATES AND CHARGES; INCREASES.
   (a)   Rates and charges for the use and services of the Municipal gas
utility shall be made and collected against each consumer who, directly or
indirectly, receives gas from the Municipal utility. The rates and charges
shall be based upon the quantity of gas used by each consumer, as measured by
the gas meter. Such charges shall be computed on a monthly basis and shall
consist of the total of the cost of gas charge and fuel adjustment charge (per
MCF) as follows (with a minimum monthly charge of the then current cost of gas
charge plus the then current fuel adjustment charge for 1,000 cubic feet of
gas):
      (1)   Cost of gas charge, plus
      (2)   Fuel adjustment charge per MCF   $2.50
      (3)   Commencing with the first billing for each customer on or after May
1 of each year, there shall be a three percent increase to the fuel adjustment
charge in effect prior to the increase.
   (b)   An amount shall be added to the gross amount of all gas bills for the

defined as 100 cubic feet of gas as delivered to the consumer.
   (c)   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
section, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this paragraph, except
where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
      (1)   “Cost of gas charge” means the cost, per MCF, to the City charged
it for its purchase of gas.
      (2)   “MCF” means 1,000 cubic feet.
   (d)   A flat fee is hereby added to the regular utility bill of each unit
owned and/or occupied by each City utility customer. The flat fee is
established at the rate of ten dollars and no cents ($10.00) for gas service.
This fee shall be billed and payable on a monthly basis along with the regular
utility bill and will be included in the regular utility bill as a separate
item. The City deems this flat fee necessary in order to accumulate sufficient
funds in the Utility Department’s separate account to pay for emergency repairs
and services of the Utility Department.

Commission shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development
does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (a)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      (2)   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      (3)   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings;
      (4)   The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of Section
1220.07, and
      (5)   Cost of project or improvements as estimated by a licensed engineer
or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
      (6)   A non-refundable permit fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   (b)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the Zoning
Building Commission shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to
be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled
after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map is not in the
floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood
elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current Flood
Insurance Rate Map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter. The Zoning
Building Commission shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map
identification. The Zoning Building Commission shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local
permits, approvals or permit-not required letters that may be required for this
type of activity. The Zoning Building Commission shall not issue a permit
unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.

proposed plat or plan accounts for changes in the drainage of surface waters in
accordance with the Plat Act (ILCS 765/205-2).
   (b)   Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located
and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and
channels. Wherever possible the floodplains shall be included within parks or
other public grounds.
(Ord. 2007-7-02. Passed 7-11-07.)
1220.09 PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER STANDARDS.
   (a)   Public health standards must be met for all floodplain development. In
addition to the requirements of Sections
1220.06 and
1220.07 the following standards apply:
      (1)   No development in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection elevation unless
such materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and
certified by a professional engineer or floodproofed building constructed
according to the requirements of Section
1220.07.
      (2)   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas and electric
shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      (3)   Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (4)   New and replacement on-site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal
systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding. Manholes or other above ground
openings located below the flood protection elevation shall be watertight.
      (5)   Construction of new or substantially improved critical facilities
shall be located outside the limits of the floodplain. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the floodplain if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or structurally dry
floodproofed to the 500-year flood frequency elevation or three feet above the
level of the 100-year flood frequency elevation whichever is greater.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities.
   (b)   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as
not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages.
(Ord. 2007-7-02. Passed 7-11-07.)
1220.10 CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION.
   For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained. In addition, the City shall notify adjacent communities in writing
30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of
the watercourse.
(Ord. 2007-7-02. Passed 7-11-07.)
1220.11 VARIANCES.
   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Zoning Building Commission
for a variance. The Zoning Building Commission shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the City Council.
The City Council may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it
deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (a)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety, or
creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      (7)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (b)   The application shall be accompanied by a non-refundable application
fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   (c)   The Zoning Building Commission shall notify an applicant in writing
that a variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of
Section
1220.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (d)   Variances to the building protection requirements of Section
1220.07 requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or alteration
of an historic site or historic structure as defined in "Historic Structures",
may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of Sections
1220.06 and
1220.07 subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
(Ord. 2007-7-02. Passed 7-11-07.)
1220.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.
(Ord. 2007-7-02. Passed 7-11-07.)
1220.13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the City to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program including:
Ordinance 1996-7-2, passed July 17, 1996. However, this chapter does not repeal
the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the
program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2007-7-02. Passed 7-11-07.)
1220.99 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Zoning Building
Commission may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this
chapter exists. The Zoning Building Commission shall notify the owner in
writing of such violation.
   (a)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation:
      (1)   The City shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined according to Section
202.99.
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      (4)   The City shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   (b)   The Zoning Building Commission shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended. The
Zoning Building Commission is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit. No site development permit shall be
permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the Zoning Building
Commission. Written notice of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and
shall state:
      (1)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation, and
      (2)   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning Building
Commission shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (c)   Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith
including, but not limited to, attorney's fees shall accrue to the person or
persons responsible.

(Ord. 94-5-1. Passed 5-11-94.)
1464.02 FINDINGS; PURPOSE.
   The corporate authorities of the City find that due to a serious housing

   (b)   Any person desiring to place a mobile home on a parcel of real estate

located thereon.
      (3)   A clearly defined drawing showing the exact location of the home on
the parcel or lot.
      (4)   Color photographs of at least three exterior sides of the proposed
mobile home. Said photographs shall be of such quality as to enable the viewer
to judge the condition and appearance of the proposed mobile home. Said
photographs shall be supplied by the applicant at the applicant's expense.
      (5)   In the event that the owner of the property upon which the mobile
home is to be located and the owner of the mobile home itself are not one and
the same person, then the owner of the property must sign the application

   (d)   Upon submission of the application to the Commission, the Commission
shall render a decision no later than fifteen days following the date of
receipt of said application, determining whether the proposed unit and site
meet the requirements of this chapter.
         The Commission may, at its discretion, send a designated inspector to
the current location of the proposed unit stated in the application for the
purpose of a visual inspection to verify the true condition of the unit. The
cost of said inspection shall be reimbursed at the Internal Revenue Service
approved mileage rate (currently thirty-one cents (31¢) per mile) plus meal
expenses (receipts required) if travel time and inspection exceed four hours.
These expenses shall be deducted from the application fee refund.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (e)   The Commission shall consider the following criteria in deciding
whether or not to approve the application:
      (1)   The age, appearance and condition of the mobile home.

applicant may request a public hearing before the corporate authorities of the
City at a regularly scheduled Council meeting. The Chairperson of the
Commission, as well as any member of said Commission so inclined, shall attend
the hearing to state the basis of the Commission's decision. Upon hearing or
viewing the evidence of both parties, the corporate authorities shall render a
binding and final decision upon the matter.
   (h)   If approved, and all other applicable ordinances have been complied
with, all permit fees have been paid and the permit has been issued, the
applicant may place the mobile home onto the approved site.

been approved for location within the corporate limits of the City. Said
registry shall be made available for public inspection at City Hall. A map
should be prepared to permit tape to be attached locating each trailer, and
various colored tape shall be used to indicate each trailer condition, with
colors to change if conditions warrant.
