      1.   The mayor shall take the chair at the hour to which the council

appeal no member may speak more than once, unless by leave of the mayor and
council members.
      3.   Every question or motion, when seconded, shall be stated by the
mayor distinctly before it is open for debate. When a question is put, if the
mayor is in doubt or a division is called for by any member, the council shall
decide. The mayor may call any member to perform the duties of the chair; but

properly warned and kept at a safe distance before a charge of explosives is
detonated. Blasting shall be done only under the supervision of a person
trained and experienced in blasting procedures.
      14.   Employee Personal Protection:
         (a)   All field employees must be properly clothed (long trousers,
shirts with sleeves or coveralls and other necessary appropriate outerwear) to
minimize exposure to the elements and hazards resulting from city operations.
         (b)   Footwear of sturdy construction shall be worn so as to minimize
the chance of injury from the hazards of one's normal duty assignment. Casual
style footwear such as canvas, slip ons and loafers are not acceptable footwear
for normal maintenance, construction, material testing and material handling
activities. (The aforementioned is not intended to cover all activities where
casual shoes are not to be worn.)
         (c)   Where it is not feasible to reduce the noise level or duration
of exposure at work areas exceeding published standards, personal protective
equipment such as earmuffs or earplugs shall be used. (Check with superior for
OSHA requirements.)
   (E)   Safety Code Receipt: Each employee of the city shall be issued a copy
of the safety code. The signed safety code receipt will be attached to
employee's personnel file which is maintained by the city comptroller.
   (F)   City Safety Policy: The following safety concepts are the fundamentals
of the city safety policy and as such shall continue to be a part of the
overall employee safety and accident prevention program:
      1.   It shall be the duty of every employee in a supervisory capacity to
carry on the operation under their jurisdiction in such a manner as to afford
the maximum protection for all employees and the public. Supervisory personnel
shall be responsible for the correction of unsafe conditions, unsafe driving
practices and the continued maintenance of good housekeeping practices.
      2.   It shall be the duty of every employee in a supervisory capacity to
see that each individual employee under their supervision receives all
necessary instruction and such training as may be required to perform work in
the safest manner possible. In addition, the person in charge shall see that
the job instructions, safe driving practices, safe work practices, good
housekeeping and the rules of the city's safety code are fully complied with by
the employee.
      3.   The city will expect the individual employee to cooperate in every
respect with the safety program so that the operations may be carried on in
such a manner as to ensure the safety of themselves, fellow workers and the
public.
      4.   It shall be the duty of each employee to consider no job so
important and no service so urgent that time cannot be taken to work and drive
safely.
   (G)   Accountability: Every employee of the department is required to know,
understand and obey all city safety rules and practices as they pertain to the
employee's job assignment.
      1.   Supervisory personnel are required to implement all safety rules,
practices and policies of the city and to provide the necessary training and
direction to ensure compliance.
The violations of city safety rules and practices have resulted in injury to
employees, damage to city equipment and third party lawsuits; therefore, the
failure to comply with safety rules and practices outlined in this chapter may
result in disciplinary action.
   (H)   Safety Suggestions And Hazard Observations: As an aid to locating and
correcting unsafe conditions and unsafe practices, every employee is encouraged
to report hazards observed (see subsection (B), "General Safety Requirements",
of this section). Those conditions noted which may not justify an immediate
call to a superior or which may require a more complete investigation can be
reported on the forms available from your department head or may be reported in
any written form.

   (A)   All police officers who are permanently assigned for duty with the
city must familiarize themselves and sign a police code of ethics as follows:
   POLICE CODE OF ETHICS Date:
As a Law Enforcement Officer, my fundamental duty is to serve mankind; to
safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the
weak against oppression or intimidation, and the peaceful against violence or
disorder; and to respect the constitutional rights of all men to liberty,
equality and justice.
I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all; maintain courageous
calm in the face of danger, scorn, or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be
constantly mindful of the welfare of others, honest in thought and deed in both
my personal and official life. I will be exemplary in obeying the laws of the
land and the regulations of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a
confidential nature or that is confided to me in my official capacity will be
kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty.
I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices,
animosities, or friendship to influence my decisions. With no compromises for
crime and with relentless prosection of criminals, I will enforce the law
courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never
employing unnecessary force or violence and never accepting gratuities.
I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it
as a public trust to be held so long as I am true to the ethics of police
service. I will constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals,
dedicating myself before God to my chosen profession....law enforcement.
   (B)   A completed code of ethics statement for each officer will be filed in
the permanent personnel file in the office of the comptroller. (Ord. 1195, 6-
10-1980)
1-23-25: DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE POLICY:
   (A)   Purpose: The purpose of this policy is to perform the necessary drug
and alcohol testing pursuant to the federally mandated requirements under 49
CFR part 40 and part 382. The drug related requirements of this policy become
effective February 13, 1996. The alcohol related requirements under this policy
become effective February 13, 1996.
   (B)   Definitions: For the purpose of this section, the words and terms
defined in this subsection shall have the meaning therein given, unless the
context otherwise clearly requires.
    DRIVER: Any person who operates a commercial motor vehicle as defined in 49
CFR part 382.107. This includes, but is not limited to: full time, regularly
employed drivers; casual, intermittent or occasional drivers; leased drivers
and independent, owner-operator contractors who are either directly employed by
or under lease to an employer or who operate a commercial motor vehicle at the
direction of or with the consent of an employer. For the purpose of
preemployment/preduty testing only, the term "driver" includes a person
applying to an employer to drive a commercial motor vehicle.
   SAFETY SENSITIVE FUNCTION: Any of those on duty functions set forth in 49
CFR part 395.2, paragraphs (1) through (7).
   (C)   Use Prohibited: The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation,
possession or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is prohibited on all
municipal premises, in any municipally owned or leased motor vehicle, or other
location at which the driver is to perform work. Nor will this municipality
hire or retain any individual who uses or possesses any illegal drug, in any
amount, regardless of frequency, or any individual who engages in prohibited
alcohol related conduct.
      1.   The municipality will maintain a preemployment screening program
designed to prevent hiring anyone who uses any illegal drugs, or engages in
prohibited alcohol related conduct.
      2.   No driver will consume any schedule 1 drug of the schedule of
controlled substance of the drug enforcement administration or any
amphetamines, narcotics, opiates, hallucinogenic substances, depressants,
stimulants, or any other habit forming drug while on or off duty, except as
provided in subsection (C)4 of this section.
      3.   No driver shall report for work or drive while impaired by any drug,
controlled substance or with an alcohol breath concentration of 0.02 or
greater.
      4.   A driver may use a substance administered by or under direction of a
physician who has advised the driver that the substance will not affect the
driver's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.
      5.   No driver may operate any motor vehicle whose motor senses, sight,
hearing, balance, reaction, reflexes or judgment are or may be presumed
affected or who has consumed any alcohol within four (4) hours.
      6.   Any driver who sells or otherwise dispenses illegal drugs or alcohol
to others on municipal premises, in or from a municipally owned or leased motor
vehicle is subject to immediate termination.
   (D)   Drug And Alcohol Testing:
      1.   Drug Testing: This municipality will require drug testing in
accordance with federal motor carrier safety requirements as set forth in part
40. Effective August 15, 1994, all urine samples shall be split samples. The
"primary sample" shall be at least thirty milliliters (30 ml) of urine; the
"split sample" shall be at least fifteen milliliters (15 ml). Failure of the
driver to provide that quantity even after a two (2) hour second opportunity
following drinking up to twenty four (24) ounces of water, will cause the
driver to be referred for a medical evaluation to develop pertinent information
whether the driver's inability to provide a specimen is genuine or constitutes
a refusal to test. The medical evaluation shall go to the medical review
officer (MRO) who will make a conclusion in writing to the employer. While this
process is being accomplished the driver shall be placed out of service.
      2.   Alcohol Testing: The municipality will require alcohol testing in
accordance with federal motor carrier safety requirements as set forth in part
40. Two (2) breath tests are required to determine if a person has a prohibited
alcohol concentration. A "screen test" shall be conducted first. Any result
less than 0.02 alcohol concentration is considered a "negative test". If the
alcohol concentration is 0.02 or greater, a second or "confirmation test" must
be conducted. This test shall be by an "evidential breath testing" (EBT)
device, that prints out the results, date, time, a sequential test number, name
and serial number of the EBT. The alcohol test must be conducted by a "breath
alcohol technician" (BAT) who is trained to operate that EBT and is proficient
in all breath alcohol testing procedures.
Drivers shall only be tested for alcohol while performing a safety sensitive
function, just before performing a safety sensitive function, or just after
performing a safety sensitive function. Any test 0.02 or greater but less than
0.04 shall cause the driver to immediately be removed from driving or any other
safety sensitive function for at least twenty four (24) hours. Failure of the
driver to provide an adequate amount of breath will cause the driver to be
immediately referred for a medical evaluation to develop pertinent information
concerning the driver's inability to provide the adequate amount of breath is
genuine or constitutes a refusal to test. The physician shall submit a written
medical evaluation to the MRO who will make a conclusion in writing to the
employer. While this process is being accomplished the driver shall be placed
out of service.
      3.   Drug Test Required: For the purposes of compliance with the federal
motor carrier safety regulations, all drivers will be required to take and
successfully pass urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing. Refusal to
submit to such screenings is considered a positive test.
      4.   Preemployment: Applicants for positions as drivers will also be
required to take and successfully pass urine drug tests and alcohol breath
tests before they can be used as drivers; except, applicants that have taken
part in qualified programs in the last thirty (30) days and tested in the last
six (6) months or in a random program in the last twelve (12) months with no
positive results.
      5.   Drug Test Records: The following information must be obtained on any
new driver from previous employers for the past two (2) years: any positive
drug test or alcohol test of 0.04 or greater, including any refusals to be
tested. Every new employee shall provide to this municipality a written release
which authorizes this municipality to obtain the driver's past drug and alcohol
test results. No driver shall be used for more than fourteen (14) days while
these test results are being secured. Regulations prohibit the use of any
driver after fourteen (14) days if these test results have not been obtained.
Any driver found to have had a positive test result in these two (2) years
shall cause the employer to further obtain information on the subsequent
substance abuse professional's evaluation and/or determination under section
382.605 and determine if there was compliance with sections 382.309 and
382.311. If not, the driver cannot be used until in full compliance.
      6.   Periodic Testing: All drivers may be required to submit to a urine
drug test and breath alcohol test at least every two (2) years at the same time
as the biennial medical examination occurs.
      7.   Reasonable Cause: Any driver suspected of drug or alcohol use as a
result of reasonable evidence upon reporting to work, during the work day, or
upon completion of his day's work activity may be subjected to a reasonable
cause urine drug or breath alcohol test. Refusal to submit to such screening
will be considered a positive test. A reasonable cause observation form must be
completed and signed by at least one qualified supervisor within twenty four
(24) hours of the observation that led to a reasonable cause test.
      8.   Random Testing:
         (a)   All employees covered by this section will be included as a part
of the Mid-West Truckers Association Drug And Alcohol Test Consortium group
from which the consortium will randomly select fifty percent (50%) each year
for drug testing and twenty five percent (25%) each year for breath alcohol
testing per the requirements of section 382.305 and 49 CFR part 40.
         (b)   On a monthly basis our MRO will from the total group select
randomly on his computer a number to be tested that on an annual basis will
equal fifty percent (50%) of that total group for random drug testing and
twenty five percent (25%) for breath alcohol testing. This same process will be
repeated each month.
         (c)   Once the MRO makes the monthly selections, he will forward that
list to the consortium which will notify the employer under whose drug policies
those selected are covered. The municipality will be given a date before which
the individual must be tested per these random selection processes. The person
to be tested shall not be informed of the need to be tested except just prior
to the actual test being performed.
         (d)   Failure of the municipality to accomplish the above requirements
in the time allotted will cause them to be out of compliance with the random
testing requirements of 49 CFR part 40.
      9.   Post-Accident Testing:
         (a)   This municipality will require post-accident urine drug and
breath alcohol testing of all employees covered by this section as required by
section 382.303 and 49 CFR part 40.
         (b)   Post-accident urine drug and breath alcohol testing will be
required of those employees who are involved in an accident if the driver
receives a citation for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident or
there is a fatality.
         (c)   The post-accident urine drug test shall be conducted as soon as
possible but not later than thirty two (32) hours after the reportable or fatal
accident. If the test is not administered, the employer shall prepare and
maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly
completed. If a breath alcohol test is not conducted within two (2) hours, a
record shall be prepared and retained stating why. If in eight (8) hours a test
is still not conducted, all attempts shall cease and a complete record made of
why it was not accomplished. In addition, the driver shall not consume any
alcohol for at least eight (8) hours following an accident or until a breath
alcohol test has been accomplished.
         (d)   A driver who is seriously injured and cannot provide a urine
specimen or breath alcohol test at the time of the accident shall provide the
necessary authorization for obtaining medical records and reports that would
indicate if a controlled substance or alcohol was in the driver's system and
the level present.
         (e)   The employer shall provide the driver with sufficient procedures
so that the driver can meet the requirements of subsections (D)9(a), (D)9(b),
(D)9(c), (D)9(d) of this section, and comply with all provisions of 49 CFR part
40.
         (f)   Failure of the driver to be readily available or refusal to give
a urine sample or breath alcohol test when the driver has been involved in a
fatal accident, or received a citation for a moving violation, except for a
driver who meets the conditions of subsection (D)9(d) of this section, shall be
considered a refusal to take a test and a positive test result.
   (E)   Test Results:
      1.   Drug Test Results: Test results will be reviewed to determine
whether there is any indication of a controlled substance abuse.
         (a)   The test results will be reviewed by an MRO. If there is any
evidence of a positive result the MRO will give the person tested an
opportunity to discuss the results and provide documentation of legally
prescribed medication.
         (b)   The results will be released to the MRO, who will then release
the results to the Mid-West Truckers Association (our drug test consortium),
which will forward them to the Illinois municipal league, which will forward
those results to this municipality, which will maintain them in a secure
location with controlled access.
      2.   Alcohol Test Results:
         (a)   The test results shall be provided on forms established by
subpart C 40.59 appendix A. Copy 1 (white) will be retained by the BATs, copy 2
(green) shall go to the employee, copy 3 (blue) shall be transmitted to the
employer.
      3.   General:
         (a)   The test results from all drug and alcohol tests will become a
part of the driver's qualification file which shall be in a secured location
with controlled access and retained as specified in section 382.401 or in this
section.
         (b)   The results will not be released to any unauthorized party
without written consent. Every driver upon termination is required to permit in
writing the release of their urine drug and breath alcohol test results for at
least two (2) years to any future employer. Every employer is required upon the
receipt of a written request of a driver to provide copies of all his or her
urine drug and breath alcohol test results promptly to any other possible
employer at no charge.
   (F)   Assistance Program: An employee assistance program will be conducted
by this municipality to provide educational information concerning the effects
and consequences of drug or alcohol use on personal health, safety and work
environment.
      1.   Every driver will be required to take at least one hour of training
each year on substance abuse and alcohol use, and sign form IML-10 certifying
their attendance.
      2.   Written notice will be given when this training is available.
   (G)   Laws And Regulations:
      1.   Compliance: This municipality will comply with all federal, state
and local laws and regulations concerning any violations of criminal drug and
alcohol use status in the work place.
      2.   Record Keeping: All records will be retained as listed in section
382.401.
      3.   Driver Access To Records: A driver is entitled, upon written
request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the driver's use of
drugs or alcohol, and test results. Access shall not be contingent upon payment
for records other than those requested.
      4.   Employer Access To Records: Records shall be made available to a
subsequent employer upon receipt of a written request from a driver.
      5.   Disclosure: An employer may disclose information required to be
maintained under this section on a driver, to the decision maker in a lawsuit,
grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of that driver and
arising from the results of an alcohol or controlled substance test required by
this section, or from the employer's determination that the driver engaged in
conduct prohibited by this section (including, but not limited to, worker's
compensation, unemployment compensation, or other proceeding related to
benefits sought by the driver).
   (H)   Disciplinary Action:
      1.   Violations of this section will result in termination.
      2.   Every driver who has engaged in violations of this section will be
advised by the employer of resources available to the driver in evaluating and
resolving problems associated with the misuse of drugs or alcohol, even though
the driver is terminated. (Ord. 1549, 2-13-1996)
1-23-26: BACKGROUND CHECKS AND LICENSE VERIFICATION:
   (A)   All city job applicants authorize the city, or its designee to conduct
a background check. To that end all such applicants shall sign a consent form
provided by the city.
   (B)   All employees who drive a city vehicle in the course of their duties
must maintain a valid driver's license. Biannually, the chief of police is
authorized to conduct a driver's license check with the secretary of state to

1-27-2: SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   (A)   Prohibition On Sexual Harassment: It is unlawful to harass a person
because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment
is a form of discrimination under title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment
free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which
affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of
Savanna to prohibit harassment of any person by any Municipal official,
Municipal agent, Municipal employee or Municipal agency or office on the basis
of sex or gender. All Municipal officials, Municipal agents, Municipal
employees and Municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually
harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack
thereof.
   (B)   Definition Of Sexual Harassment: This policy adopts the definition of
sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently
defines sexual harassment as:
      1.   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      2.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
         (b)   Non-verbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures. "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
         (c)   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (d)   Physical: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (e)   Textual/electronic: "Sexting" (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and
depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person".
   (C)   Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment:
      1.   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his
position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not
necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
      2.   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
         (a)   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact With Supervisory Personnel: At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
Director of Human Resources, an Ethics Officer, the City Manager or
Administrator, or the Chief Executive Officer of the Municipality.
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must
not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses
and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
Municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
         (c)   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this policy is
to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
Municipality. However, all Municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint
with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days.
      3.   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
      4.   All allegations, including; anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
Municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
   (D)   Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment
Allegations: No Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or
Municipal agency or office shall take any retaliation action against any
Municipal employee due to a Municipal employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy,
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any Municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a Municipal employee's involvement in protected activity
pursuant to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made
in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected
from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State
Officials and Employees Ethics Act 1  provides whistleblower protection from
retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee, or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act 2 , an employer may not retaliate against an
employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or
before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where
the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an
employer may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a
government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause
to believe that the information discloses a violation of a State or Federal
law, rule, or regulation 3 .
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act 4 , it is a civil rights violation
for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a
person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good
faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a
charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
An employee, who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over
for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge - due within one hundred eighty (180) days (IDHR) or three
hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation.
   (E)   Consequences Of A Violation Of The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition On Sexual Harassment contained in 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 430/
5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the Municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State
law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the Municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an Ethics Commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a State or Federal agency.
   (F)   Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report: A false report is a
report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment
report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable Municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an Ethics Commission, an Inspector General, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 2215, 1-9-2018)

from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the PZB
after the notice of appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of fact
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion cause imminent peril to
life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise
than by restraining order, which may be granted by the PZB or by a court of
record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken
and on due cause shown.
   (C)   The PZB may reverse or confirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
order, requirement, decision or determination as, in its opinion, ought to be

review act of the state of Illinois, and all amendments and modifications
thereto and the rules adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 2158, 4-26-2016)
2-4-8: VARIATIONS:

the provisions of the zoning title where there are particular difficulties or
particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of any of the
provisions of the zoning title relating to the use, construction or alteration
of buildings or structures or the use of land. However, no such variation shall
be made by the city council except in a specified case and after a public
hearing before the PZB pursuant to a notice, and after a report with a finding
of fact by the PZB as provided by the laws of this state.
   (B)   The city council, by ordinance, without further public hearing, may
adopt any proposed variation or may refer it back to the PZB for further
consideration; provided however, that any proposed variation which fails to
receive the approval of the PZB shall not be passed except by the favorable

3-8-4-2: DEFINITIONS:
Except where the content otherwise requires, the definitions given in this
section govern the construction of this section
3-8-4:
HOTEL: Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or
intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel,
house, rooming house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house
trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.
OCCUPANCY: The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any
room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or
sleeping purposes.
OPERATOR: The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of
owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other
capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of
any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be
deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same
duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
PERSON: Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social
club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust,
business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination
acting as a unit.
RENT: The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of
space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor
or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and service of
any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.
TRANSIENT: Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by
reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a
period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of
calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall
be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired
unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant
providing for a longer period of occupancy, or the occupant has paid in advance
for over thirty (30) days' occupancy. In determining whether a person is a
transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to
the effective date of this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002)
3-8-4-3: TAX IMPOSED:
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and
shall pay a tax in the amount of five percent (5%) of the rent charged by the
operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which
is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient
shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If
the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be
paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s
ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid
to the operator of the hotel, the city clerk may require that such tax shall be
paid directly to the city clerk. Operator shall remit such tax within thirty
(30) days of the close of the month in which such tax accrued. Failure of the
operator to remit such tax shall lead to imposition of a fifteen dollar
($15.00) late charge per month it remains due. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002; amd. Ord.
2295, 9-14-2021)
3-8-4-4: EXEMPTIONS:
No tax shall be imposed upon:
   (A)   Any persons as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the
power of the city to impose the tax herein provided;
   (B)   Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business;
   (C)   Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by
reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.
No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time
rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the
city clerk. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002)
3-8-4-5: OPERATOR'S DUTIES:
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this section
3-8-4 at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The
amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged,
and each transient shall receive receipt for payment from the operator. No
operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or
indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part
will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-
2002)
3-8-4-6: REGISTRATION:
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this chapter, or within
thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator
of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the
city clerk and obtain from her a "transient occupancy registration certificate"
to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said
certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (A)   The name of the operator;
   (B)   The address of the hotel;
   (C)   The date upon which the certificate was issued;
   (D)   This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the
person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform
Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the City Clerk for the
purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting
said tax to the City Clerk. This certificate does not authorize any person to
conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful
manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local
applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any
board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not
constitute a permit.
(Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002)
3-8-4-7: REPORTING AND REMITTING:
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close
of each calendar quarter, make a return to the city clerk, on forms provided by
her, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax due for
transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the
tax due shall be remitted to the city clerk. Returns and payments are due
immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by
operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of
the city until payment thereof is made to the city clerk. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-
2002)
3-8-4-8: PENALTIES AND INTEREST:
   (A)   Original Delinquency: Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this section
3-8-4 within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the
amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.
   (B)   Continued Delinquency: Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on
which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency
penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount
of the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed.
   (C)   Fraud: If the nonpayment of any remittance due under this section is
due to fraud, a penalty of twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax
shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (A)
and (B) of this section.
   (D)   Interest: In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails
to remit any tax imposed by this section
3-8-4 shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or
fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties from the date
on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.
   (E)   Penalties Merged With Tax: Every penalty imposed and such interest as
accrued under the provisions of this section
3-8-4 shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 1698, 8-
13-2002)
3-8-4-9: FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY CITY CLERK:
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect said tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the city clerk shall proceed in such
manner as she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base
her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the city clerk shall procure such facts
and information as she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of
any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, she shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and
penalties provided for this section
3-8-4. In case such determination is made, the city clerk shall give a notice
of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at
his last known address. Such operation may within ten (10) days after the
serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the city clerk
for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a
hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and
penalties, if any, determined by the city clerk shall become final and
conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the
city clerk shall give not less than five (5) days written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a hearing at a time and
place fixed in said notice why said amount specified there should not be fixed
for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear
and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be
so fixed. After such hearing, the city clerk shall determine the proper tax to
be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the
manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after
fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in section
3-8-4-10 of this chapter. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002)
3-8-4-10: APPEAL:
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the city clerk with respect to the
amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city
council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen (15)
days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall
give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The
findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.
Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the
service of notice. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002)
3-8-4-11: RECORDS:
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to
the city of any tax imposed by this section
3-8-4 to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may
be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for
the collection of and payment to the city, which records the city clerk shall
have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002)
3-8-4-12: REFUNDS:

or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the city under this section
3-8-4 it may be refunded as provided in subsections (B) and (C) of this section
provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the
specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the city clerk
within three (3) years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms
furnished by the city clerk.
   (B)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the city clerk that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the
transient to the operator.
   (C)   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than
once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a
claim in the manner provided in subsection (A) of this section, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient directly to the city clerk, or when the
transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction
of the city clerk that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from
the operator who collected the tax.
   (D)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002)
3-8-4-13: ACTIONS TO COLLECT:
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this
chapter shall be deemed a debt by the transient to the city. Any such tax
collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a
debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owning money to the city
under the provisions of this section
3-8-4 shall be liable in an action brought in the name of the city for recovery
of such amount. (Ord. 1698, 8-13-2002)

that tax as an additional charge, which charge may be stated in combination, in
a single amount, with any State tax that sellers are required to collect.
      2.   The taxes hereby imposed, and all civil penalties that may be
assessed as an incident thereto, shall be collected and enforced by the

3-9-1: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION:
   (A)   The mayor and council expressly find and declare that:
      1.   Cigarette smoking and use of electronic smoking devices are
dangerous to human health;
      2.   There exists substantial scientific evidence that the use of tobacco
products and electronic smoking devices used to inhale nicotine, or other
substances, causes cancer, heart disease and various other medical disorders;
      3.   The surgeon general of the United States has declared that nicotine
addiction from tobacco is similar to addiction to cocaine, and is the most
widespread example of drug dependence in this country;
      4.   The director of the National Institute On Drug Abuse concluded that
the majority of the three hundred twenty thousand (320,000) Americans who die
each year from cigarette smoking became addicted to nicotine as adolescents
before the age of legal consent;
      5.   The National Institute On Drug Abuse found that cigarette smoking
precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug use; and
      6.   The present legislative scheme of prohibiting sales of tobacco
products to persons under the age of eighteen (18) has proven ineffective in
preventing such persons from using tobacco products.
      7.   Existing ordinances of the city are insufficient to address the
dangers caused by cigarette smoke in bars, restaurants, public buildings and
places of employment. It is therefore the legislative intent of the city
council to adopt in the form of a local ordinance the language of the smoke
free Illinois act, 410 Illinois Compiled Statutes 82/10, as amended herein.
   (B)   The enactment of this chapter directly pertains to and is in
furtherance of the health, welfare and safety of the residents of the city.

council shall permit or deny the erection of or variation of the size or
structure of a fence; provided, that the public works superintendent makes
findings of fact based upon evidence presented to the public works
superintendent in each specific case that:
   (A)   The plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances; and, the
fence, if permitted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
   (B)   The conditions upon which the application is based are not generally
applicable to other property within the same zoning classification.
   (C)   The alleged need for the fence was not created by any person presently

the clear view of traffic for motorists or pedestrians, or endanger the public
safety in any manner whatsoever, or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
This provision shall not be interpreted or construed to repeal or invalidate
any fence now permitted by any other city regulation. (Ord. 1359, 8-22-1989)
4-5-5: PERMIT; FEE:
No fence, wall, hedge or shrub shall be installed or constructed without first
having obtained from the public works superintendent a construction permit.
Said permit shall be considered after there is filed a written application to
be in the form and contain such information as may be requested by the
superintendent, reasonably showing that the proposed fence, wall, hedge or
shrub is in conformity with all regulations of the city. The superintendent may
also request drawings, necessary to determine whether such proposed fence meets
the aforesaid regulations. Each applicant for a permit shall pay a fee in the
amount of twenty dollars ($20.00) to the city. (Ord. 1359, 8-22-1989)

services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required
include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations),
schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major roads
and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or electrical
transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals,

countywide flood insurance rate map of Carroll County prepared by the federal
emergency management agency and dated December 17, 2010. Floodplain also
includes those areas of known flooding as identified by the community. The
floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Carroll County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city
are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for
Carroll County by the federal emergency management agency and dated December
17, 2010.

NEW CONSTRUCTION: Structures for which the start of construction commenced on
or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a
community and includes any subsequent improvements of such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed or buildings to be constructed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed on or after the effective date of the floodplain management
regulations adopted by a community.

START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement, was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a substantial improvement, actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or

(20%).
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done. The term does
not include:
(A) Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or
local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
(B) Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of historic
places or the Illinois register of historic places.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the required federal, state, and/or local permits
and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided. (Ord. 1958, 10-26-2010)

requirements of this chapter. Specifically, the director of public works shall:
   (A)   Process development permits in accordance with section
4-6-5 of this chapter;
   (B)   Ensure that all development in a floodway (or a floodplain with no
delineated floodway) meets the damage prevention requirements of section
4-6-6 of this chapter;
   (C)   Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings
subject to section
4-6-7 of this chapter are met and maintain a record of the "as built" elevation
of the lowest floor (including basement) or floodproof certificate;
   (D)   Assure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements of
section
4-6-8 of this chapter;
   (E)   Ensure that water supply and waste disposal systems meet the public
health standards of section

coordinate base flood data and to improve the administration of this chapter;
   (L)   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps,
copies of state and federal permits, and documentation of compliance for
development activities subject to this chapter;
   (M)   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain;
and
   (N)   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 1958, 10-26-2010)
4-6-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the director of public works or his designee. The
director of public works shall not issue a development permit if the proposed
development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;

base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by
survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has
not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is
not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. In addition, any development located on land shown to be below the
base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a flood source, but not
identified as floodplain on the current flood insurance rate map, is subject to
the provisions of this chapter.

4-6-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Savanna planning and
zoning board for a variance. The planning and zoning board shall review the
applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
city council. The city council may attach such conditions to granting of a
variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter. (Ord.
1958, 10-26-2010; amd. Ord. 2158, 4-26-2016)
   (A)   Conditions To Be Met: No variance shall be granted unless the
applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and

4-6-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will: (Ord. 1958, 10-26-2010; amd. Ord. 2158, 4-26-2016)
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic Structures: Variances to the building protection requirements
of section
4-6-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
4-6-6 and
4-6-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter. In order to
minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance
issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and wet
floodproofed.
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farmhouses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
section

The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city of Savanna or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 1958, 10-26-2010)
4-6-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the director of public works
or municipal attorney may determine that a violation of the minimum standards
of this chapter exists. The director of public works or municipal attorney
shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:

of the property.
   (B)   The director of public works or municipal attorney shall inform the
owner that any such violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood
damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy
to be suspended.
The director of public works or municipal attorney is authorized to issue an
order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order
shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work
order. The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the permit. (Ord. 1958,
10-26-2010)
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the Savanna planning and zoning board. Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state: (Ord. 1958, 10-
26-2010; amd. Ord. 2158, 4-26-2016)
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and

At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the planning and zoning
board shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked. (Ord.
1958, 10-26-2010; amd. Ord. 2158, 4-26-2016)

2010)

This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city of
Savanna to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program.
However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance
adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
Where this chapter and other ordinance, easements, covenants or deed
restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent

6-9-6: Selected Definitions
6-9-7: Effect On Other Rights
6-9-8: Disclaimer Of Liability
6-9-1: STATEMENT OF POLICY:
   (A)   When certain individuals are treated differently in the housing market
because of racial, religious or other prejudices, the entire community suffers.
Discrimination frequently denies its immediate victims their right to acquire a
decent home in a safe and pleasant neighborhood. Discrimination also typically
causes neighborhoods to become highly segregated, and engenders instability on
the fringes of such areas. This instability seriously impairs any sense of
community responsibility and accelerates neighborhood decay. Neighborhood decay
reduces the housing supply and deflates the tax base. Concurrently, it
increases the need for government services and necessitates a higher tax rate.
   (B)   Although discrimination in housing is proscribed by the United States
and Illinois constitutions and by various federal laws, the problem is best
handled at the local level because: 1) there is no statewide enforcement
program, and 2) the federal enforcement machinery is disturbingly slow,
inadequate and sometimes simply unresponsive to local needs.
   (C)   In light of the above, the council hereby declares that it is the
public policy of this municipality to endeavor to ensure all persons an equal
opportunity to provide for themselves a home of their own choosing that is as
sufficient as their individual talents, industry and circumstances may permit.
(Ord. 1507, 8-23-1994)

   (A)   Prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, creed, ancestry,
national origin or physical or mental handicap in the marketing, disposition
and financing of housing; and
   (B)   Establishing procedures for the fair and efficient administration and
enforcement of such regulations. (Ord. 1507, 8-23-1994)
6-9-3: JURISDICTION:
This chapter shall be applicable within the corporate limits of this
municipality. (Ord. 1507, 8-23-1994)
6-9-4: INTERPRETATION:
Every provision of this chapter shall be construed liberally to further the
policy and purpose of this chapter, and every requirement imposed herein shall
be deemed minimal. (Ord. 1507, 8-23-1994)
6-9-5: CONSTRUCTION OF TERMS:
In construing the intended meaning of terminology used in this chapter, the

merely to facilitate general reference, and in no way limit the substantive
application of the provisions set forth thereunder.

within that section; but a reference to a particular subsection designates only
that subsection.

terms shall not be limited to the enumerated class unless expressly limited.

Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by
the superintendent before installation.
   (K)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection
to the public sewer. Each and every part of a sewer connection shall be
inspected and approved by the waterworks superintendent or his representative
before being concealed or backfilled.
   (L)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall comply with the
provisions of this code relating to excavations in streets 1  and shall be
adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in
the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
(1977 Code; amd. Ord. 1248, 11-23-1982)
   (M)   Upon the completion of a sanitary sewer service line by the property
owner, the city public works department may perform site restoration and may
reimburse the property owner in the amount up to five hundred dollars ($500.00)
in the instance of a residential building or up to seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00) in the instance of a commercial or industrial building, on the
following terms and conditions: 1) prior to the commencement of such work, the
property owner submitted to the director of public works a written application

7-5-5: USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS:
   (A)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water,
surface water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated
cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
   (B)   Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated as combined sewers or storm sewers,
or to a natural outlet approved by the superintendent. Industrial cooling water
or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, on approval of the
superintendent, to a storm sewer, combined sewer, or natural outlet.
   (C)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the
following described waters or wastes to any public sewers:
      1.   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid, or gas.
      2.   Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids,
or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a
hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, create any hazard in the
receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant, or to cause the effluent from
the treatment works to violate applicable effluent standards.
      3.   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5, or having any other
corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures,
equipment, and personnel of the sewage works.
      4.   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of
causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the
proper operation of the sewage works such as, but not limited to, ashes,
cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar,
plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure, hair and
fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole
or ground by garbage grinders.
   (D)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the
opinion of the superintendent that such wastes can harm either the sewers,
sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a
nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of
the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant, and maximum limits established by regulatory agencies,
including the NPDES permit of the city.
      1.   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred
fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150°F) (65°C).
      2.   Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease, or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred milligrams per liter (100 mg/l) or
containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures

similar objectionable or toxic substances beyond the maximum allowable
concentrations as determined by the superintendent.
The superintendent will evaluate each toxic or objectionable substance waste on
a concentration dilution basis and will establish maximum allowable discharge
concentrations for each individual person to protect against the following:
         (a)   Decreased sewage plant treatment process efficiencies and
degraded effluent qualities exceeding the current requirements of the
regulatory agencies.
         (b)   Concentrations of any toxic or objectionable substance in the
sewage treatment plant effluent exceeding the current maximum limits
established by the regulatory agencies for such plant effluent flows.
         (c)   Any concentrations of toxic or objectionable substances in plant
effluent flows which will result in concentrations of such substances in the
receiving waters which will exceed the regulatory agency's maximum allowable
limits for these substances in the receiving waters.
      6.   Any mercury or any of its compounds in excess of 0.0005 milligrams
per liter as Hg at any time except as permitted by the superintendent in

concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      10.   Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
      11.   Materials which exert or cause:
         (a)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate).
         (b)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions).
         (c)   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.
         (d)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined herein.
      12.   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters;
   (E)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsection (D) of this section, and/or which
are in violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in chapter 1, EPA
rules and regulations, subchapter D, water programs part 128- pretreatment
standards, federal register volume 38, no. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973, and
amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the superintendent may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise creates a hazard to life or constitutes a public
nuisance, the superintendent may:
      1.   Reject the wastes, and require the violator to cease and desist
discharging said materials into the sewer system immediately.
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers, as outlined above.
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
      4.   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions
of subsection (I) of this section.
If the superintendent permits the treatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (F)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent and shall be located
as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (G)   Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided
for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (H)   Each new industry shall be required to install a control manhole and,
when required by the superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (I)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods For The Examination Of
Water And Waste Water", published by the American Public Health Association or
methods approved by the Illinois environmental protection agency and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at
said control manhole. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular
analysis involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all outfalls of
a premises is approximate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24 hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic
grab samples.)
Any person discharging wastes having concentrations greater than the "normal"
concentrations as set forth herein shall, upon notification by the approving
authority, install a composite sample with a compatible pacing (metering)
device for monitoring said substances. The pacing and sampling devices shall be
of a type approved by the superintendent.
   (J)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the city or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge.
The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the city, but no less than once per year the
industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater
discharge to assure that compliance with federal, state and local standards are
being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory
analysis to the city at such times and in such a manner as prescribed by the
city. The owner shall bear the expenses of all measurements, analysis, and
reporting required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary, the city
reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside
laboratory.
   (K)   No industrial user may discharge sewage into any public sewer until
the city has adopted an industrial cost recovery system which:
      1.   Meets the requirements of section 204(b)(1)(B) of the federal water
pollution control act amendments of 1972 and applicable federal regulations,
and
      2.   Has been approved by the agency in accordance with the conditions of
any grant made to the city by the United States environmental protection agency
or by the state for the construction of any part of the sewer system or sewage
treatment works of the city.
   (L)   No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with the city user charge system. (1977 Code; amd. Ord. 1248, 11-23-
1982)
7-5-6: PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE:
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, wilfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance,
or equipment which is a part of the sewage works. Any person violating these
provisions shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly
conduct. (1977 Code)
7-5-7: POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS:
   (A)   The superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the city,
the Illinois environmental protection agency, and the United States
environmental protection agency bearing proper credentials and identification
shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The superintendent or his representatives shall
have no authority to inquire into any processes including metallurgical,
chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper, or other industries beyond that point
having a direct bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewers or
waterways or facilities for waste treatment.
   (B)   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in subsection (A) of this section, the superintendent or duly authorized
employees of the city, the Illinois environmental protection agency, and the
U.S. environmental protection agency shall observe all safety rules applicable
to the premises established by the company and the company shall be held
harmless for injury or death to the city employees and the city shall indemnify
the company against loss or damage to its property by city employees and
against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage
asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling
operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company
to maintain safe conditions as required in subsection
7-5-5(H) of this chapter.
   (C)   The superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the city
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all
private properties through which the city holds a duly negotiated easement for
the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying
within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement,
shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement
pertaining to the private property involved. (1977 Code; amd. Ord. 1248, 11-23-
1982)
7-5-8: PUBLIC SEWER MAIN EXTENSIONS:
   (A)   General Policy: It is hereby established as the policy of the city
that all sewer mains proposed to be extended within the corporate limits of the
city shall be constructed in accordance with the following:
      1.   Preliminary Survey: When the owner of one or more building sites
within a lot, block, tract or parcel of land, within the corporate limits of
the city, which is not served by the city sewer system requests an extension of
the sewer system to serve the property owned by him, the city superintendent
shall make a preliminary survey of the premises, and report to the city council
on the feasibility of the proposed construction.
      2.   Plans, Specifications, Estimate Of Cost: If it appears from the
report of the city superintendent that the city sewer system, as it then
exists, is of ample size and design to accommodate the properties which will be
served by such extension and it is determined by the city council to proceed
with the extension as proposed, the city superintendent shall be directed to
cause the preparation of the plans and specifications for the sewer main
extension in accordance with the environmental protection agency regulations,
including an estimate of cost of the proposed extension, including construction
costs, material costs and engineering fees.
The property owner(s) requesting said sewer main extension shall deposit with
the city the amount of the estimated engineering fees prior to authorizing the
preparation of the plans and specifications. Except as otherwise provided, said
deposit shall be returned if it is decided to construct the sewer main
extension.
When the plans and specifications for the proposed construction of the sewer
main extension together with the estimated costs thereof are completed, the
property owner(s) requesting such extension shall be advised of the estimated
cost of the work; and if he decides not to proceed further, the money he has
deposited will be used to pay the engineers' charges for preparing the plans,
specifications and estimated cost of the work.
Such plans and specifications shall contain a map showing properties to be
benefited by the sewer main extension together with the legal description of
such properties.
      3.   Bids: If the cost estimate is acceptable to the property owner(s)
requesting the sewer main extension, the city council shall authorize the city
superintendent to advertise for bids for the construction work specified in the
plans and specifications and exhibit such bids to the property owner(s)
requesting the sewer main extension.
If one of the bids is acceptable to the city council and the property owner(s)
requesting the sewer main extension, the city council shall authorize the city
superintendent to advertise for bids for the construction work specified in the
plans and specifications and exhibit such bids to the property owner(s)
requesting the sewer main extension.
If one of the bids is acceptable to the city council and the property owner(s)
requesting the sewer main extension, the property owner(s) requesting the sewer
main extension shall be required to deposit with the city a sum equal to
charges hereinafter established for reimbursement charges. Upon receipt of said
sum(s) of money, the city council shall authorize the purchase of such
materials.
      4.   Reimbursement Charge: The city council hereafter is providing for a
sewer property reimbursement charge to reimburse the city for funds expended in
the extension of sewer mains. As closely as possible, such charges are to be
established so as to be equivalent to the pro rata share of the cost of said
extension benefiting the abutting property owner(s) along the extension.
Sewer main extensions shall be constructed by contract and the reimbursement
property charges shall include any labor costs, street replacement costs,
engineering fees, legal fees and material costs required to complete the sewer
main extension. Such costs and fees shall be apportioned equally among the
number of linear frontage feet abutting the improvement.
The sums herein provided for shall be in addition to and exclusive of all other
charges required and fixed by this code in connection with sewer service
installations.
The property owner(s) requesting the sewer main extension shall apply for
connecting (during construction) to the sewer main extended and pay the cost of
labor and materials required to install and connect said sewer service line
with the sewer main. All applications, before approval, shall be accompanied by
the requisite sewer property reimbursement and sewer connection charge in
certified funds or cash.
Whenever the owner(s) of the remaining unaccessed properties abutting said
sewer main extension thereafter apply to the city for a sewer service line
connection with said sewer main extension, then the city superintendent shall
certify to such applicant the reimbursement charge and all sewer service line
connection applications before approval shall be accompanied by the requisite
sewer property reimbursement charge and sewer service line connection charge.
      5.   Records: The city comptroller shall record in the files of the city
the location of the sewer main extended, the total project costs, the
reimbursement charges as established at the time of construction and the
abutting property descriptions of the properties benefited, together with a
current record of the reimbursement charges paid and unpaid.
All sewer mains extended under this section, except as otherwise provided for,
shall become part of the city's sewer distribution system upon completion of
the construction of said sewer main extension.
   (B)   Sewer Main Extensions Beyond The Corporate Limits: It is the policy of
the city council to exercise discretion in approving sewer main extension or
service line connections to owner(s) and user(s) who are outside the corporate
limits of the city. In the event that the city council approves the sewer main
extensions or a service line connection without the corporate limits of the
city, said extension or connection thereof shall be constructed in accordance
with subsection (A) of this section, except that said charges shall be at the
rate of one and one-half (11/2) times the charge then applicable to those
properties within the corporate limits. (Ord. 1165, 4-24-1979)
7-5-9: PENALTIES:
   (A)   Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter, except
section
7-5-6, shall be served by the city with written notice stating the nature of
the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory
correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in
such notice, permanently cease all violations . or take the necessary
corrective actions to abate a violation. Due to the potential life and safety
issues that can result from a failure to comply with this chapter, or to take
the necessary corrective actions to abate the violation, non-compliance may
result in the water service being shut-off to the property in violation. If the
property does not have water service, the City may terminate the sewer service
to the City sewer main. The cost of all work associated with this action will
be charged to the property owner, as well as the cost to reinstate the sewer
service lateral. Failure to pay any and all cost may result in a lien being
placed against the property in question.
   (B)   Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit
provided for in subsection (A) of this section, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof shall be fined in the amount not
exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each violation. Each day in which
any such violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense.
   (C)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned by the
city by reason of such violation. (1977 Code; amd. Ord. 1248, 11-23-1982; Ord.
2283, 12-8-2020)

7-6-1: APPLICATION FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE:
Persons desiring to avail themselves of the services of the city's wastewater
system shall make application therefor with the city comptroller on a form
provided for that purpose.
Wastewater service accounts shall be in the name of the owner of the property
serviced and only such owner shall be recognized as the consumer, except as
noted hereinafter. The owner of the respective premises serviced shall be held
responsible for the payment of all wastewater charges and all other proper
charges in connection with the wastewater services to said respective premises,
but such payments will be accepted from the tenant or tenants of said
respective premises if rendered by them, but the acceptance of such payments
from said tenant, shall not relieve the owner from the responsibility of and
for the payment of water rentals or other service charges not paid when due.
Wastewater service accounts may be established in the name of a customer other
than the owner only after the owner has been advised of his responsibility for
payment and only after the owner has affixed his signature on an affidavit form
supplied by the city. (1977 Code; amd. Ord. 1118, 5-10-1977)
7-6-2: BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge and a
surcharge, if applicable.
The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual debt service
of all outstanding revenue bonds by the number of users. Through further
divisions, the monthly and quarterly debt service charges can be computed.
The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters
and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal concentrations:
   (A)   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
   (B)   A suspended solids content of two hundred forty milligrams per liter
(240 mg/l).
It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall
be computed as follows:
   (A)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain
the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund.
   (B)   Estimate the projected annual billable water and/or wastewater volumes
from past meter reading records.
   (C)   Compute the user rate by dividing the annual operation, maintenance
and replacement costs by the annual billable water and/or wastewater volume.
A surcharge will be levied to all users whose wastewater exceeds the normal
concentrations for BOD5 of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/L) and/or
suspended solids of two hundred forty milligrams per liter (240 mg/L). The
surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or
wastewater meters for all wastes which exceed the two hundred milligrams per
liter (200 mg/L) and two hundred forty milligrams per liter (240 mg/L)
concentration for BOD5 and suspended solids respectively. The surcharge will be
computed by multiplying the excess quantity of BOD5 in pounds per billing
period and/or the excess quantity of suspended solids in pounds per billing
period by the unit treatment costs for BOD5 and suspended solids which shall be
computed as follows:
   (A)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain
the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund (same as paragraph 4,
subsection (A) of this section).
   (B)   Proportion annual operation, maintenance and replacement costs to
major wastewater treatment plant categories.
   (C)   Proportion major wastewater treatment plant category costs to volume,
BOD5, and suspended solids.
   (D)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of BOD5 and pounds of suspended
solids to be treated annually.
   (E)   Compute unit treatment costs for volume (dollars per 1,000 gallons),
for BOD5 (dollars per pound) and for suspended solids (dollars per pound) by
dividing the annual volume, BOD5 and suspended solids costs by the annual plant
loading.
Section
7-6-7 of this chapter specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
The adequacy of the user charge shall be reviewed annually and the wastewater
service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt
service or a change in operation, maintenance and/or replacement costs. (Ord.
1245, 9-28-1982)
7-6-3: MEASUREMENT OF FLOW:
   (A)   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and
surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of one thousand (1,000) gallons.
   (B)   If the person discharging the wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by
the Superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained
from these other sources.
   (C)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the Superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the
metered water consumption records. Metering devices for determining the volume
of waste shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following
approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent
of the Superintendent. (1977 Code; amd. Ord. 1118, 5-10-1977)
7-6-4: SEWER FUNDS:
   (A)   Sewer System Improvement Fund: A service charge of three dollars
($3.00) per month per service account, payable on monthly or quarterly billing
periods, is hereby established to each user of the sewage facilities to be
applied to the Sewage System Improvement Fund to be used for maintenance and
improvements to the City's sewer works system.
   (B)   Sewer Reserve And Replacement Fund: A reserve and replacement charge
of four dollars ($4.00) per month per service account, payable on monthly (or
quarterly) billing periods, is hereby established to each user of the sewage
facilities to be applied to the Reserve and Replacement Fund to be used by the
City for repair and replacement of the wastewater facilities. (Ord. 2185, 12-
13-2016)
   (C)   Sewer Debt Service Fund: A debt service fee of twenty dollars ($20.00)
per month per service account, payable on monthly (or quarterly) billing
periods, is hereby established to each user of the sewerage facilities to be
applied to the annual debt payment associated with the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency's loan for the in-system sewer improvements and the new
wastewater treatment plant projects.
Such debt service will be put in place and will remain in effect until the
annual debt associated with the IEPA loan has been repaid. The City shall
annually review the debt service fee to ensure enough revenues are earned to
pay the annual debt. (Ord. 2218, 2-27-2018)
7-6-5: BASIC USER RATE:
There shall be and there is hereby established a minimum charge and a basic
user rate for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities
of the City. On May 1 of each year, beginning with May 1, 2011, the minimum
charge and basic user rate for schedules 1 and 2 of this section shall be
increased by three percent (3%) and an ordinance passed by the City Council
amending said fees.
   Schedule 1:   Resident Users:
      A minimum charge of twenty-eight dollars and sixty cents ($28.60) per
billing period shall be applied to all users whose water consumption does not
exceed ten thousand (10,000) gallons per billing period.
      A basic user rate of two dollars and eighty-six cents ($2.86) per one
thousand (1,000) gallons shall be applied to all resident users for water
consumption in excess of ten thousand (10,000) gallons per billing period.
   Schedule 2: Nonresident Users:
      All nonresident users shall be metered on the water supply or the sewer
service, as approved by the City Council. Each account shall pay double the
rates as established in schedules 1 and 3 of this section, and section
7-6-6 of this chapter.
      In the event a metering device is not provided, a flat rate as determined
by the City Council shall be established as a minimum flat rate charge. The
adequacy of the flat rate charge shall be reviewed annually by the City Council
and the rate revised to reflect a change in service. The minimum flat rate
charge shall in no case be less than two hundred and one dollars and ninety-six
cents ($201.96) per quarter, which includes sewer system improvement fees,
sewer reserve and replacement fee, public ways and property improvement fee,
and sewer debt service fee. In the event that use of the wastewater facilities
is determined to be in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) gallons per quarter,
the City may require such flat rate user to install metering devices on the
water supply or sewer service to measure the amount of service supplied.
   Schedule 3: Wastewater Rates For Running Water To Prevent Freezing:
      The user shall be billed for fifty percent (50%) of the metered water
usage in excess of his average water usage, in addition to the regular rates
established heretofore. The average water usage shall be computed as provided
in section 8-4-23, schedule 13 of this Code. (1977 Code; amd. Ord. 1245, 9-28-
1982; amd Ord. 2160, 4-26-2016; amd. Ord. 2222, 4-10-2018; amd. Ord. 2247, 4-
23-2019; amd. Ord. 2267, 5-26-2020; Ord. 2289, 4-27-2021; Ord. 2305, 4-26-2022;
Ord. 2324, 4-25-2023)
7-6-6: SURCHARGE RATES:
The rates of surcharge for BOD and SS shall be as follows:
   (A)   For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), five cents ($0.05) per pound.
   (B)   For suspended solids (SS), four cents ($0.04) per pound. (1977 Code;
amd. Ord. 1245, 9-28-1992)
7-6-7: COMPUTATION OF SURCHARGES:
The surcharge per person shall be computed by the following formula:
S = V (0.00834) (A[BOD5 - 200] + B1/2 [SS - 240])
Where:
S       = Amount of surcharge ($)
V       = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per billing period
0.00834 = Unit weight of water x 106 per thousand gallons
A       = Unit charge per pound for BOD5 per pound (see section
          7-6-6 of this chapter)
BOD5    = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand, mg/L
200     = Allowable BOD5 strength
B       = Unit charge per pound of SS, mg/L
SS      = Suspended solids, mg/L
240     = Allowable SS, mg/L
 
The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be established
by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as may be deemed
necessary by the Superintendent and shall be binding as a basis for surcharges.
(1977 Code; amd. Ord. 1245, 9-28-1982)
7-6-8: COMPUTATION OF WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
The wastewater charge per user will be computed by the following formula:
WWC = D + Mww + (V-6,000) (Rww) + S + F
Where:
 
WWC = Amount of wastewater service charge in dollars per billing period.
D   = Wastewater debt service charge in dollars per billing period.
      Minimum wastewater charge for 6,000 gallons or less per billing period
Mww = (section
      7-6-5 of this chapter).
      Wastewater volume in gallons per billing period to the lowest increment
      of 1,000 gallons. This volume is the users average volume when water is
V   = used to prevent freezing (section
      7-6-5 of this chapter, schedule 3). For wastewater volume less that 6,000
      gallons, this part of the formula is zero.
Rww = Wastewater service charge rate in dollars per 1,000 gallons (section
      7-6-5 of this chapter, schedule 1).
      Amount of wastewater surcharge in dollars per billing period as computed
S   = in section
      7-6-7 of this chapter.
      Billing for running water to prevent freezing in dollars, per billing
F   = period as computed in section
      7-6-5 of this chapter, schedule 3.

8-4-16: WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS:
   (A)   General Policy: It is hereby established as the policy of the city
that all water mains proposed to be extended within the corporate limits of the
city shall be constructed in accordance with the following:
      1.   Preliminary Survey: When the owner of one or more building sites
within a lot, block, tract or parcel of land, within the corporate limits of
the city, which is not served by the city water system requests an extension of
the water system to serve the property owned by him, the city superintendent
shall make a preliminary survey of the premises, and report to the city council
on the feasibility of the proposed construction.
      2.   Plans, Specifications, Estimate Of Cost: If it appears from the
report of the city superintendent that the city water system, as it then
exists, is of ample size and design to accommodate the properties which will be
served by such extension and it is determined by the city council to proceed
with the extension as proposed, the city superintendent shall be directed to
cause the preparation of the plans and specifications for the water main
extension in accordance with the environmental protection agency regulations,
including an estimate of cost of the proposed extension, including construction
costs, material costs and engineering fees.
The property owner(s) requesting said water main extension shall deposit with
the city the amount of the estimated engineering fees prior to authorizing the
preparation of the plans and specifications. Except as otherwise provided, said
deposit shall be returned if it is decided to construct the water main
extension.
When the plans and specifications for the proposed construction of the water
main extension together with the estimated costs thereof are completed, the
property owner(s) requesting such extension shall be advised of the estimated
cost of the work; and if he decides not to proceed further, the money he has
deposited will be used to pay the engineers' charges for preparing the plans,
specifications and estimated cost of the work.
Such plans and specifications shall contain a map showing properties to be
benefited by the water main extension together with the legal description of
such properties.
      3.   Bids: If the cost estimate is acceptable to the property owner(s)
requesting the water main extension, the city council shall authorize the city
superintendent to advertise for bids for the materials specified in the plans
and specifications and exhibit such bids to the property owner(s) requesting
the water main extension.
If one of the bids is acceptable to the city council and the property owner(s)
requesting the water main extension; the property owner(s) requesting the water
main extension shall be required to deposit with the city a sum equal to
charges hereinafter established for reimbursement charges. Upon receipt of said
sum(s) of money, the city council shall authorize the purchase of such
materials.
      4.   Reimbursement Charge: The city council hereafter is providing for a
water property reimbursement charge to reimburse the city for funds expended in
the extension of water mains. As closely as possible, such charges are to be
established to be equivalent to the pro rata share of the cost of said
extension benefiting the abutting property owner(s) along the extension.
Water main extensions shall be constructed by the city and the reimbursement
property charges shall include any street replacement costs, engineering fees,
legal fees and material costs required to complete the water main extension.
Such costs and fees shall be apportioned equally among the number of linear
frontage feet abutting the improvement.
The sums herein provided for shall be in addition to and exclusive of all other
charges required and fixed by this code in connection with sewer service
installations.
The property owners requesting the water main extension shall apply for
connecting (during construction) to the water main extended and pay the cost of
labor and materials required to install and connect said water service line
with the water main. All applications, before approval, shall be accompanied by
the requisite water property reimbursement and water connection charge in
certified funds or cash.
Whenever the owner(s) of the remaining unaccessed properties abutting said
water main extension thereafter apply to the city for a water service line
connection with said water main extension, then the city superintendent shall
certify to such applicant the reimbursement charge and all water service line
connection applications before approval shall be accompanied by the requisite
water property reimbursement charge and water service line connection charge.
      5.   Records: The city controller shall record in the files of the city
the location of the water main extended, the total project costs, the
reimbursement charges as established at the time of construction and the
abutting property descriptions of the properties benefited, together with a
current record of the reimbursement charges paid and unpaid.
All water mains extended under this section, except as otherwise provided for,
shall become part of the city's water distribution system upon completion of
the construction of said water main extension.
   (B)   Water Main Extensions Beyond The Corporate Limits: It is the policy of
the city council to exercise discretion in approving water main extensions or
service line connections to owner(s) and user(s) who are outside the corporate
limits of the city. In the event that the city council approves the water main
extensions or a service line connection without the corporate limits of the
city, said extension or connection thereof shall be constructed in accordance
with subsection (A) of this section, except that said charges shall be at the
rate of one and one-half (11/2) times the charge then applicable to those
properties within the corporate limits. (Ord. 1164, 4-24-1979)
8-4-17: METERS:
   (A)   Usage: All water used by the water customer shall be measured with a
water meter furnished and installed by the water department at no cost to the
customer. The water department will own and maintain all meters; provided,
however, that additional or auxiliary meter or meters desired by the owner or
customer being supplied for the purpose of subdividing the total water used,
shall be at the entire expense of such owner or customer, and shall be their
property; in that case the reading of such additional meters, and the
maintenance thereof, shall be by the owner or users.
Each and every water consumer shall be provided a water meter, except a master
water meter may be installed, which shall measure all the water supplied to a
number of trailers, apartments, stores or offices provided they are located in
one building or on one parcel of land and are under one ownership.
The water department reserves the right to determine the size, location and
number of meters required for any service.
   (B)   Installation: The water meter shall be installed in a convenient
location for the personnel of the water department to read and maintain.
Wherever practicable meters shall be located inside the building being serviced
and shall be located as close as possible to the point of entry of the water
service pipe, and the entire length of the service from the point of entry to
the water meter shall always be exposed. At no time shall water meters be
installed in washrooms.
All meters shall be set plumb and level and secured to remain so. They shall be
placed in an accessible location, free from all obstructions, so that they can
be easily serviced, and shall be protected by the consumer from freezing or
damage. Brass couplings or unions shall be installed on the inlet and outlet
side of the meter. A gate valve must be installed within one foot (1') of the
meter on both inlet and outlet. No red lead or white lead shall be used in
making meter connections.
Where a meter is installed on a water service pipe connected to a hot water
boiler, steam boiler or other hot water apparatus, a check and relief valve
shall be provided between such meter and boilers or hot water heaters, to
protect the water meter from damage caused by back pressure from steam or hot
water.
In residential areas where there is no basement and where the design of the
building is such that installing the water meter inside would be impractical,
the water meter shall be placed in a pit not more than eight feet (8') inside
the sidewalk line. The water department will furnish and install a frostproof
meter box. The owner will be billed for this service on a time and material
basis as outlined in section
8-4-23, schedule 7(F) of this chapter.
Where meters are set in pits, the top of said meter shall be located fourteen
inches (14") below the ground line and shall be provided with a yoke with
expansion joint or its equal. For five-eighths inch (5/8") meter, a twenty one
inch (21") diameter tile will be used for the pit section; for a three-fourths
inch (3/4") and one inch (1") meter, a twenty four inch (24") diameter tile
will be provided. Said pit will be covered with a cast iron cover provided with
an auxiliary inner cover to make air space. Soil will be packed tightly around
the tile and cover, clear up to the lid, and care will be taken not to use
crushed rock, gravel or cinders. Clay or loam are the best. Water meters over
one inch (1") shall be set in a concrete vault.
In business or manufacturing districts, the location of the meter and the
construction of a pit for same (if a pit is required) shall be at the
discretion of the superintendent.
   (C)   Sealing: After proper installation of water meters, all meters shall
be sealed by the water meter department, which seal or seals shall not be
broken except by authority of said department. (1977 Code)
   (D)   Repair: Ordinary repairs will be scheduled and made to meters by the
water department at its own expense. In case of damage to a meter by reason of
freezing or hot water or any act or omission of the consumer, the consumer,
property owner or both shall pay the water department a repair fee as outlined
in section
8-4-23, schedule 7(B) of this chapter for the cost of repairs. The fee will be
included with the next water bill, and in case of theft or complete
disconnection of any meter by reason of any act or omission of the consumer,
the owner shall pay the water department the full value of the meter and all
cost associated with replacement and installation in accordance with section
8-4-23, schedule 7(B) of this chapter. (Ord. 2075, 12-10-2013)
   (E)   Failing To Register: Whenever any meter, by reasons of it being out of
repair or for any cause, fails to properly register the water passing through
the same, the consumer shall be charged at the rate shown during the
corresponding period of the previous year. If no record of the previous year
exists, then it shall be the duty of the superintendent to estimate or
determine, so far as he can, the amount of water consumed during the time
estimated by said superintendent to be due. If the estimated water consumed is
judged unfair by the consumer, he may present all facts to the water committee
whose decision will be final.
Notice shall at once be given the water department when a meter is found by
owner, occupant or tenants to be out of order. (1977 Code)
   (F)   Testing: In the event a water customer desires to test the accuracy of
the water meter, the customer shall fill out and submit a meter testing request
form, available from the water department. After receiving the meter testing
request form, the water department will send the meter out to be tested for a
fee as outlined in section
8-4-23, schedule 7(C) of this chapter. A temporary meter will be installed
during the testing period to register water usage. If the meter test indicates
that the meter is over registering (fast) in excess of one and one-half percent
(1.5%), the meter will be repaired or replaced and the customer will not be
charged a testing fee. If the results of the meter test indicate that the meter
is registering within one and one- half percent (1.5%), the customer will be
charged a fee in accordance with section
8-4-23, schedule 7(C) of this chapter. (Ord. 2076, 12-10-2013)
   (G)   Tampering: In accordance with section
8-4-24 of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any plumber or other person,
without the consent of the water department, to attach, disconnect, repair,
test or tamper with any water meter connected with the waterworks system. In
case any consumer shall vacate the premises upon which there is a water meter
in service without notice being served on the water department in sufficient
time to permit the removal of said meter without damage to same, the owner of
such property so vacated shall be held liable and responsible for all water
passing through the meter and also all damage done to the said meter.
   (H)   Temporary Metering; Temporary Water Usage: The water department may
permit water to be used temporarily from any fire hydrant for other than
domestic purposes in locations where no other supply can be obtained by
attaching a reducer to one of the hydrant openings and controlling the supply
by means of a small valve. The flow from such water supply shall be registered
through a meter. The cost for these services and water usage shall be as
outlined in section
8-4-23, schedule 7(D) of this chapter, which costs shall include a meter
deposit fee which shall be refunded if the meter is still in good repair upon
discontinuance of said service. If the meter is in any manner damaged, said
water user shall be required to pay for necessary repairs as outlined in
section
8-4-23, schedule 7(B) of this chapter. (1977 Code)
   (I)   Access: If an authorized agent of the water department is unable to
gain access to a premises for any reason to install, repair, replace or inspect
a water meter, or obtain a reading of the water meter after making two (2)

matter of public record and shall be repeated at least every two (2) years, or
as often as the superintendent of water shall deem necessary. Records of such
surveys shall be maintained and available for review for a period of at least
five (5) years.

superintendent or his authorized agent shall have the right to enter at any
reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water supply
or distribution system of the city for the purpose of verifying information
submitted by the customer regarding the required cross connection control
inspection. On demand, the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so
served shall furnish to the superintendent of water any information which he
may request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such
property. The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the
discretion of the superintendent of water, be deemed evidence of the presence
of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (E)   The superintendent of water of the city is hereby authorized and
directed to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the
water service to any property wherein any connection in violation of the
provisions of this section is known to exist and to take such other
precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water supply distribution mains. Water service to
such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been eliminated
or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this section, and until a
reconnection fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00) is paid to the city. Immediate
disconnection with verbal notice can be effected when the superintendent of
water is assured that imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public
water supply system exists. Such action shall be followed by written
notification of the cause of disconnection. Immediate disconnection without
notice to any party can be effected to prevent actual or anticipated
contamination or pollution of the public water supply, provided that, in the
reasonable opinion of the superintendent of water or the Illinois environmental
protection agency, such action is required to prevent actual or potential
contamination or pollution of the public water supply. Neither the
environmental protection agency, the superintendent of water or their agents or
assigns shall be liable to any customer for any injury, damages or lost
revenues which may result from termination of said customer's water supply in
accordance with the terms of this section, whether or not said termination was

through backflow, if contamination of the potable water supply system occurs
through an illegal cross connection or an improperly installed, maintained or
repaired device or a device which has been bypassed, must bear the cost of
cleanup of the potable water supply system. (Ord. 1389, 8-28-1990)

preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights of way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the city's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of
way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established prior
to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired
and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may
be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar
agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city
rights of way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
chapter.
   (E)   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar agreement
shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful
renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this

period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant
to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and
all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held
at a date, time and place designated by the city with such city representatives
in attendance as the city deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose
of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights of
way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.
   (D)   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 1928, 10-13-2009)
8-7-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within ninety (90) days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
8-7-21 of this chapter. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor. (Ord. 1928, 10-13-2009)
8-7-8: INSURANCE:
   (A)   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right of way or
constructing any facility in the right of way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents,
and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in subsections (A)1
and (A)2 of this section:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      3.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and
subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors
shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the

written notice addressed to the City Mayor of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event
later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection (A) of this section, or the requirements of
subsections (B), (C) and (D) of this section. A utility that elects to self-
insure shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements
required under subsection (A) of this section, such as evidence that the
utility is a "private self-insurer" under the workers' compensation act.
   (F)   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company. (Ord. 1928, 10-13-2009)
8-7-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 1928, 10-13-2009)
8-7-10: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the city director of public works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely
to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the city director of
public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 1928, 10-13-2009)

deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the city within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
      3.   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights of way and restore the rights of way
to the satisfaction of the city providing written proof of such removal to the
city within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of revocation.
The city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time periods
provided in this subsection.
   (D)   Stop Work Order: In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection (A) of this
section.
   (E)   Failure Or Refusal Of The Permittee To Comply: If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection (C) of this section, the city or
its designee may, at the option of the city: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2)
upon not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days'
notice to the permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them
abandoned and property of the city. The permittee shall be liable in all events
to the city for all costs of removal. (Ord. 1928, 10-13-2009)

employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway

right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
city director of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free

decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The city director of public works
may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the city director of public works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the city
director of public works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the
right to appeal to the city council, or such other board or commission as it
may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
city clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement,
decision or determination. The city council shall commence its consideration of
the appeal at the council's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least
seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The city council shall timely

with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the city will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 1928, 10-13-2009)
8-7-23: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the city may have for enforcement of this chapter. (Ord.

yard width as otherwise herein required in the applicable district regulations
may be reduced by not more than five percent (5%), but no lot shall be reduced
to less than fifty feet (50') in width or a side yard reduced to less than four
feet (4') in width. When qualifying permanent open space is accessory to
private or semipublic school or other approved institutional use, such
reductions shall be not more than one-half (1/2) of the reductions referred to
above, in all cases.
      2.   Qualifying permanent open spaces shall be land, designated for open
spaces in the comprehensive plan of the city, which is located within the

When title to land is not held by a governmental body, the use of such land for
open space shall be perpetuated by recorded covenants accompanying a recorded

10-8-1: SCOPE OF REGULATIONS:
The off street parking and off street loading provisions of this title shall
apply as follows:
   (A)   Unless exempted, accessory off street parking and off street loading
facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of this chapter for
all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established after the
effective date of this title. However, where a building permit has been issued
prior to the effective date of this title, and provided that construction is
begun within six (6) months of such effective date and diligently prosecuted to
completion, parking and loading facilities in the amounts required for the
issuance of said building permit may be provided in lieu of any different
amount required by this title. (Ord. 1997, 2-28-2012)
   (B)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises shall
be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating
capacity, or other units of measurement in the amount specified herein
requiring parking or loading facilities, such additional parking and loading
facilities as herein required shall be provided.
   (C)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter
be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use. However, if the said building or structure was
erected prior to the effective date of this title, additional parking or
loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements
for the new use would exceed those for the existing use, if the latter were
subject to the parking and loading provisions of this title. (1977 Code)
10-8-2: EXISTING PARKING FACILITIES:
Accessory off street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of
this title and located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not
hereafter be reduced below the requirements for a similar new building or use
under the provisions of this title. (1977 Code)
10-8-3: PERMISSIVE PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES:
Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of
off street parking and loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or
buildings, provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design,
and operation of such facilities are adhered to. (1977 Code)
10-8-4: DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION:
For any conforming or nonconforming building or use which is in existence on
the effective date of this title, which subsequently thereto is damaged or
destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause, and which is
reconstructed, reestablished, or repaired, off street parking and loading
facilities shall be provided. Such parking or loading facilities equivalent to
any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or
continued in operation, except in no case shall it be necessary to restore or
maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this
title for equivalent new uses or construction. (1977 Code)
10-8-5: CONTROL OF OFF SITE PARKING FACILITIES:
In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the lot on
which the building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the
same possession as the lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking
facilities are accessory. A covenant running with the land must be recorded in
the office of the recorder of deeds of Carroll County, Illinois, on the lot
upon which the accessory off street parking is located which prohibits any
other use on that lot until such time as either one of the following conditions
occur:
   (A)   The structure on the lot containing the principal use is removed and
the principal use terminated; or
   (B)   Another lot of the required size within the required distance is
properly developed and used for the required accessory off street parking in
place of and in lieu of the initial lot used for accessory off street parking
with the same requirements, covenants, and conditions attaching to such
substitute accessory use lot as approved by the same authority as required for
approval of such initial use lot. The said covenants shall be recorded in the
office of the recorder of deeds of Carroll County, Illinois. (1977 Code)
10-8-6: OFF STREET PARKING:
Off street parking facilities for motor vehicles shall be provided in
accordance with additional regulations set forth hereinafter:
   (A)   Use: Accessory off street parking facilities required as accessory to
uses herein listed shall be solely for the parking of automobiles of patrons,
occupants, or employees. When bus transportation is provided for patrons,
occupants, or employees of a specific establishment, additional open or
enclosed off street parking spaces for each bus to be parked on the premises
shall be provided in accordance with regulations herein for access, in yards,
design, and maintenance and area applicable to accommodating such buses. (1977
Code)
   (B)   Exemptions:
      1.   When the application of the off street parking regulations specified
hereinafter results in a requirement of not more than three (3) spaces on a
single lot in any business or manufacturing district, such parking spaces need
not be provided. The sum of the number of required spaces shall be used for
instances where two (2) or more uses exist on a single lot. This exemption
shall not apply to dwelling units or lodging rooms.
      2.   Due to the uniqueness of the B-1 retail business district, with the
presence of on street parking and public parking facilities, it shall be exempt
from the off street parking and off street loading requirements of this chapter
to preserve the character of its historic buildings. However, nothing shall
prohibit the voluntary establishment of off street parking spaces.
   (C)   Computation: When determining the number of parking spaces to be
provided, the gross square footage of a structure shall be used, excluding
restrooms, storage areas and rooms used for mechanical equipment such as
furnaces and water heaters. When determination of the number of off street
parking spaces required by this title results in a requirement of a fractional
space, any fraction of one-half (1/2) or less may be disregarded while a
fraction in excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one parking space.
(Ord. 1997, 2-28-2012)
   (D)   Collective Provision: Off street parking facilities for separate uses
may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not
less than the sum of the separate requirements for each such use and provided
that all regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces, in
relation to the use served, are adhered to. Further, no parking spaces or
portion thereof shall serve as a required space for more than one use unless
otherwise authorized by the planning and zoning board. (1977 Code; amd. Ord.

upon an aisle or driveway and have a minimum width of twenty four feet (24'),
in order to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such
parking space. All off street parking facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley, which shall be
located as far as practical from an intersection of a public right of way.
      5.   Surfacing: All open, off street parking areas and all access drives
and aisles containing four (4) or more parking spaces shall be improved with a
durable pavement consisting of not less than seven inches (7") of water bound
macadam base with a wearing surface of not less than two inches (2") of asphalt
or the equivalent within one year from the date that construction began on the
parking area. Asphalt millings may be used as surfacing materials if an
appropriate binder is applied to keep the millings in place. Parking areas and
access drives and aisles for less than four (4) parking spaces shall be
improved at least with a gravel base and dustproof surfacing. In areas where it
can be shown that permeable soils are present and allow proper drainage, the
superintendent of public works or his/her assigned designee may permit the use
of permeable paving materials, including, but not limited to, porous concrete,
permeable interlocking concrete pavers, concrete grid pavers, and porous
asphalt. Compacted gravel and/or similar materials, including, but not limited
to, asphalt millings and broken up concrete, will not be considered as
permeable pavement. Parking lots constructed of gravel and similar materials
shall be permitted only upon the approval of a variation.
      6.   Screening And Landscaping: All open automobile parking areas
containing four (4) or more parking spaces, which are located across a public
right of way from, or adjacent to a lot in a residence district, or lot whose
primary use is for a dwelling, shall be effectively screened on each side
adjoining or fronting on such property line by a wall and/or fence with a
minimum height of six feet (6'), but not to exceed eight feet (8'), densely
planted compact hedge with a minimum height of three feet (3') at the time of
planting, or a landscaped berm with a minimum height of two and one-half feet
(2.5') planted with deciduous trees, shrubs and grass installed in such a
manner as to not obstruct the clear view of motorists and pedestrians at
intersections of driveways, sidewalks and roadways. Walls and fences shall only
be used for screening of parking areas that are adjacent to interior lot lines.
For parking facilities containing fifty (50) or more parking spaces, interior
and perimeter landscaping shall be provided equal to ten percent (10%) of the
impervious surface area of the parking facility. All perimeter and interior
landscaping shall be protected by a raised curb. Each interior landscape area
shall be equal to one parking space in area and be placed to provide shade,
break up long rows of parking spaces, or to help delineate drive aisles.
Further, each interior landscape area shall be planted with a deciduous tree
with a diameter of two and one-half inches (2.5") at the time of planting.
Perimeter landscaping shall have a minimum width of ten feet (10') be planted
with deciduous trees, shrubs and plants. All landscaping shall be done in a
fashion so as to not create a visual barrier to motorists and pedestrians.
(Ord. 1997, 2-28-2012)
      7.   Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off street parking areas
shall be directed away from residential properties in such a way as not to
create a nuisance, and in a parking area containing four (4) or more parking
spaces such lighting shall be extinguished not more than one-half (1/2) hour
after the close of business except as may otherwise be permitted or required by
the planning and zoning board for maintaining illumination with less
candlepower after the time specified above. (Ord. 1997, 2-28-2012; amd. Ord.
2158, 4-26-2016)
      8.   Maintenance: All off street parking and loading areas shall be
maintained in good repair, and in safe condition at all times, so as not to
constitute a hazard to public safety or a visual or aesthetic nuisance to
surrounding land.
All off street parking and loading areas shall be periodically restored to
maintain a clear identification of separate parking stalls.
   (F)   Location: All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses
erected or established in single-family residence districts after the effective
date of this title shall be located on the same lot or adjoining lot as the
building or use served. Buildings or uses other than single-family dwellings
existing on the effective date of this title which are subsequently altered or
enlarged so as to require the provision of parking spaces under this title or
new uses may be served by parking facilities located on land other than the lot
on which the building or use served is located, provided such facilities are
within three hundred feet (300') walking distance of said building and the land
must either be under the same ownership as the use being served, or if the land
is not under the same ownership, then it must be controlled by a perpetual
lease agreement, the proof of which must be provided before the use can be
established.
   (G)   Employee Parking: Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall
be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing, or both, on
the premises at any one time.
   (H)   Required Spaces: The minimum number of off street parking spaces
accessory to designated uses shall be provided as follows: (Ord. 1997, 2-28-

                                         automobile laundry. Maximum capacity,
                                         in this instance, shall mean the
                                         greatest possible number of

10-9-1: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming
uses, buildings and structures, and to specify those circumstances and
conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures and uses shall
be gradually eliminated upon reaching the end of their respective normal useful
life, in accordance with the authority granted by Illinois statutes. (1977
Code)
10-9-2: AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES:
Any building, structure or use which existed lawfully at the time of the
adoption of this title, and which remains or becomes nonconforming upon the
adoption of this title or of any subsequent amendment thereto, may be continued
only in accordance with the following regulations:
   (A)   Repairs And Alterations: Ordinary repairs and alterations may be made
to a nonconforming building or structure, provided that no structural
alteration shall be made in or to such building or structure, all or
substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in
the district in which it is located, except those required by law, or except to
make the building or structure and use thereof conform to the regulations of
the district in which it is located. Ordinary repairs and alterations shall be
determined by the building inspector, and shall include, among other things,
the replacement of storage tanks where the safety of operation of the
installation requires such replacement.
   (B)   Additions And Enlargements:
      1.   A nonconforming building or structure all or substantially all of
which is designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in which
it is located shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless such
nonconforming building or structure and use thereof, including all additions
and enlargements thereto, is made to conform to all the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
      2.   A nonconforming building or structure which is nonconforming only as
to bulk, may be added to or enlarged, provided such addition or enlargement
conforms to all regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (C)   Moving: No building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other location unless every portion of such building or structure, and the
use thereof, is made to conform to all regulations of the district in which the
moved building is located.
   (D)   Restoration Of Damaged Nonconforming Buildings Or Structures: A
building, structure or portion thereof, all or substantially all of which is

it is located, and which is destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty or
act of God to the extent that the cost of restoration to the condition in which
it was before the occurrence will exceed sixty percent (60%) of the total cost
of reconstructing the entire building or structure, shall not be restored
unless said building or structure and the use thereof shall conform to all
regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event that such
damage or destruction is less than seventy percent (70%) of the cost of
reconstructing the entire building or structure, no repairs or construction for
restoration shall be made unless such work is started within one year from the
date of the partial destruction and is diligently prosecuted to completion.
   (E)   Discontinuance Of Use Of Nonconforming Building Or Structure: A
building, structure or portion thereof, all or substantially all of which is
designed or intended for a use which is not permitted in the district in which
it is located, and in which the use has ceased by discontinuance or
abandonment, on the effective date hereof or thereafter is abandoned and
remains unoccupied, or is not used for a continuous period of one year, shall
not thereafter be occupied or used, except by a use which conforms to the use
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (F)   Change Of Use In Nonconforming Building Or Structures: The
nonconforming use of a building or structure all or substantially all of which
is designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is
located, may be changed to a use permitted in the district in which the
building or structure is located, or the nonconforming uses of a part of such
building may be extended to the remaining parts of the building but no change
or extension of use shall extend or otherwise modify any provision made in this
title for elimination of such nonconforming building or structure and the use
thereof.
