unconstitutional but upholds the constitutionality of the remainder of the act,
or does not address the remainder of the act, then the remainder of the act as

part of this chapter relating to the part of the act found unconstitutional
shall be deemed repealed without further action by the corporate authorities of
the village. (Ord. 577, 5-11-2004)

(Ord. 768, 3-8-2022)
EXHIBIT D
CATALOGING AND INDEXING OF PUBLIC RECORDS
The Act requires that public bodies must list ( catalog) all types or
categories of records under their control ,vhich are prepared or received after
July 1, 1984. There is some question, and perhaps it can only be resolved by
litigation, whether the municipality must catalog exempt records. The Act
indicates that the purpose of the catalogued list is to aid individuals to
“gain access” to public records under the Act, and since certain records are
exempt from public access, the most reasonable interpretation of the Act would
be that you do not have to catalog or list exempt records. However, you may
wish to maintain a separate catalog or listing of exempt records until such
time as the Attorney General or the courts clarify the extent of cataloguing
required.
Please note that the Act requires the list to be by "type" or "category" of
records and not listing every individual record. Suggested below are different
types of categories that a public body might wish to establish to cover the
records that it has under its control and which are subject to inspection under
the Act. This list is by no means meant to be exhaustive and is merely for
reference or descriptive purposes. Obviously, the number of types or categories
will vary from municipality to municipality (e.g., some municipalities have
fire departments, some do not, etc).
(A)   The "type" of records is meant to be a broad general category and the
category is a sub-part of the type. For example, one type of record is a
financial record. Under "financial records" may be the following categories:
   1.   Budget;
   2.   Appropriation ordinance;
   3.   Audit;
   4.   Bills;
   5.   Receipts for revenue;
   6.   Vouchers;
   7.   Cancelled checks;
   8.   Water bills;
   9.   Sewer bills;
   10.   Receipts for fines;
   11.   Sales tax receipts;
   12.   Real estate tax receipts;
   13.   Liquor license fees;
   14.   Other license fees;
   15.   Building permit fees;
   16.   Salary schedules;
   17.   Utility bills (e.g., telephone, gas and electric);
   18.   Etc.
(B)   This gives you examples of categories that could be listed under the
general type “Financial record”. Other general types could include, for
example, the following:
   1.   Building inspection reports;
   2.   Administrative memoranda;
   3.   Building permits;
   4.   Board minutes;
   5.   Board resolutions;
   6.   Board ordinances;
   7.   Correspondence received by municipality;
   8.   Correspondence from municipality;
   9.   Bidding specifications;
   10.   Board policies;
   11.   Administrative rules and regulations;
   12.   Personnel code;
   13.   Village maps;
   14.   Comprehensive plan;
   15.   Zoning ordinance;
   16.   Building ordinance;
   17.   Personnel files;
   18.   Office equipment;
   19.   Insurance;
   20.   Capital equipment;
   21.   Real estate;
   22.   Legal notices;
   23.   Newspaper articles;
   24.   Consulting contracts;
   25.   Contracts for capital equipment;
   26.   Contracts for office supplies;
   27.   Contracts for maintenance and repair;
   28.   Professional consultant contracts;
   29.   Pension fund records;
   30.   Hospitalization records;
   31.   Worker's compensation records;
   32.   Training records;
   33.   Official bonds;
   34.   Municipal stickers;
   35.   Village vehicles;
   36.   Animal control records;
   37.   Village liens;
   38.   Police department records;
   39.   Fire department records;
   40.   Etc.
Again, the above list is not meant to be exhaustive. While you certainly need
not catalog your records to the same degree as you list expenses in your annual
appropriation ordinance or your annual budget, such may be used as a convenient
starting point for determining what categories and types of records you may
wish to list. Of course, you also should rely on your past experience by
reviewing the records you currently have on hand and dividing them into what
will appear to you to be meaningful categories. Remember, there is a great deal
of latitude in determining what the categories or types of records will be and
consequently what the list would contain, but keep in mind the stalutory
mandate being that the list must be "reasonably current" and must be
"reasonably detailed" in order to assist the individual in obtaining access to
public records.

CHAPTER 11
POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
SECTION:
1-11-1: Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-11-2: Definition Of Sexual Harassment
1-11-3: Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment
1-11-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations
1-11-5: Consequences Of A Violation To The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-11-6: Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report
1-11-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title Vll
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of Village of Erie to prohibit harassment of any
person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee,
municipal agency or municipal office on the basis of sex or gender. All
municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal
agencies or municipal offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any
person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof. (Ord. 752,
7-14-2020)
1-11-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   (A)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual's employment, either explicitly or implicitly; or
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
limited to:
      1.   Verbal Harassment: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates; or, statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
      2.   Non-Verbal Harassment: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls,"
"smacking" or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical Harassment: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/Electronic Harassment: "Sexting" (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication email/text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites (like
Facebook and Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person." (Ord. 752, 7-14-2020)
1-11-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      1.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      2.   Contact With Supervisory Personnel: At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator or the chief elected official of the municipality.
   (C)   The employee experiencing what she/he believes to be sexual harassment
must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no
witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible
officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
      1.   Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within three hundred (300) days
of the alleged incidents) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with
the EEOC must also be filed within three hundred (300) days.
      2.   Allegations Of Sexual Harassment Made Against An Elected Official Of
The Governmental Unit By Another Elected Official Of A Governmental Unit: In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the human resources director,
the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
   (D)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not
limited to. written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
   (E)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 752,
7-14-2020)
1-11-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee's or official's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
or
      2.   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, healing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
      3.   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee's or official's involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 430/15-
10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, and this policy
prohibits retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension,
demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an
employee who does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule
or regulation; or
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 Illinois Compiled Statutes 174/
15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses
information in a court, an administrative hearing, before a legislative
commission or committee or in any other proceeding, where the employee has
reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a
state or federal law, rule or regulation. In addition, an employer may not
retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law
enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. (See 740 Illinois Compiled Statutes 174/15(b).)
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-301), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire
to retaliate against a person because she/he has opposed that which she/he
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because she/he has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge within three hundred (300) days of the alleged
retaliation. (Ord. 752, 7-14-2020)
1-11-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION TO THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or the
prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 430/
5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per
offense, applicable disciplinary actions or discharge by the municipality and
any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance,
state law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a state or federal agency. (Ord. 752, 7-14-2020)
1-11-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
   (A)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
   (B)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State
Police, a State's Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement
official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any
person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

1-15-5: Employee Usage
1-15-6: Employee Acknowledgment
1-15-1: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
The Village of Erie believes that the use of social media platforms can
effectively broaden the reach of government communication to its constituents
and foster a dynamic environment for social discourse. The use of social media
by the Village of Erie is to convey or obtain information that is useful to, or
will further the goals of, this local government. (Ord. 761, 4-13-2021)
1-15-2: ADMINISTRATION OF ACCOUNTS:
A designated administrator, or administrators, will be responsible for
maintenance and supervision of each social media platform of the Village. Each
administrator will be knowledgeable regarding the terms of the social media use
policy, regarding other responsibilities to review content to ensure it is in
compliance with the policy and in furtherance of the Village's goals. (Ord.
761, 4-13-2021)
1-15-3: COMMENT POLICY:
   (A)   Social media platforms not only provide the government with a
communications venue but often allow for public comment to be posted to the
Village's sites. Any comment made by a member of the public as a social media
user is that user's opinion only. Publication of the comment does not imply
endorsement or agreement by the government nor reflect the opinions or policies
of the government.
   (B)   The following enumerated list of content may not be permitted on the
Village's social media platforms and such content is subject to removal and/or
restriction by the administrator. Content that:
      1.   Promotes discrimination;
      2.   Violates a legal ownership interest (such as a copyright or
trademark);
      3.   Threatens any person or organization;
      4.   Includes personally identifiable information, such as a Social
Security number or other sensitive information;
      5.   Violates any federal, state or local law or encourages illegal
activity;
      6.   Is obscene, sexual or pornographic in content, and/or language;
      7.   Promotes commercial activities not related to government business;
      8.   Is spam or links to malware/viruses; or
      9.   Discloses confidential government information, sensitive information
or personal information relating to government officials and employees, or
members of the public.
   (C)   Each particular private social media enterprise maintains a "Terms of
Use" agreement. All comments posted to any Village social media platform are
bound by those Terms of Use agreements and the Village reserves the right to
report any user violation to the respective enterprise.
   (D)   The Village of Erie reserves the right to remove content from, or deny
access to, any government social media platforms if any individual or
organization violates the social media use policy. (Ord. 761, 4-13-2021)
1-15-4: COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS:
All Village social media platforms shall adhere to applicable federal, state
and local laws, regulations and policies. Content posted on any Village social
media platform by any user is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, record
retention laws and may be subject to e-discovery laws. Property that is
protected by copyright or trademark should not be posted or maintained on a
social media platform in violation of the owner's legal interest. (Ord. 761, 4-
13-2021)
1-15-5: EMPLOYEE USAGE:
   (A)   The Village of Erie recognizes that social media creates opportunities
for community engagement, interpersonal connection and self-expression, but it
also creates risks and responsibilities. Everyone should assume that any use of
social media - whether on a business or personal account - could be viewed by a
colleague, supervisor, partner, supplier or member of the public. If any social
media activity of an employee of the government adversely affects the
employee's job performance, the performance of fellow employees, or otherwise
adversely affects the goals of the government, an employee of the government
may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
   (B)   Disclosure of confidential government information, sensitive
information or personal information relating to government officials and
employees, or members of the public, is prohibited.
   (C)   It is requested that employees who identify themselves as employees of
the Village of Erie post a disclaimer on their own personal social media
platforms that any posts or blogs are solely the opinion of the employee and
not the employer.
   (D)   Personal use of social media in the workplace may be allowed within
reasonable time limits so long as it does not adversely impact the government
employee's job performance.
   (E)   Employees of the Village have no expectation of privacy when using the
Internet on employer equipment or during hours of employment. (Ord. 761, 4-13-
2021)
1-15-6: EMPLOYEE ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
Employees are required to sign a written acknowledgment that they have
received, read and understand this policy, and submit that acknowledgment to
the designated administrator. The form attached to Ordinance 761, which is
hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in full herein, shall
sufficiently satisfy this requirement upon receipt. (Ord. 761, 4-13-2021)

Notes

2-2-3: APPEAL:
An appeal may be taken to the board of appeals by any person, or by any
officer, department, board or bureau affected by a decision of the building
official relative to the zoning title. Such appeal shall be taken within such
time as shall be prescribed by the board of appeals by general rule, by filing
with the building permit director and with the board of appeals a notice of
appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The building official shall forthwith
transmit to the board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the building official certifies to the board of appeals after the
notice of appeal has been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court
of record on application, on notice to the building official and on due cause
shown.
The board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the
appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties and shall render a decision
on the appeal without unreasonable delay. Any person may appear and testify at
the hearing, either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. (Ord.
215, 9-17-1962; amd. Ord. 803, 5-13- 2025)

the fee shall be determined from time to time by majority vote of the board of
trustees and shall be as set forth in a schedule of fees on file and available
for public inspection in the office of the village clerk. (Ord. 540, 9-11-2001)
2-2-5: DECISION:
The board may reverse or affirm wholly or partly or may modify or amend the
order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from to the extent and
in the manner that the board may decide to be fitting and proper in the
premises. (Ord. 215, 9-17-1962)
2-2-6: VARIATIONS:
When a property owner shows that a strict application of the terms of the
zoning title relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or
structures, or to the use of land, imposes upon him practical difficulties or
particular hardship, then the board may make such variations of the strict
application of the terms of the zoning title as are in harmony with its general
purpose and intent when the board is satisfied, under the evidence heard before
it, that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to
the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable hardship or
difficulty so great as to warrant a variation in the following instances:
   (A)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot in single ownership as shown on record.
   (B)   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been destroyed or damaged to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its
value, by fire, or act of God, or the public enemy, where the board shall find
some compelling public necessity requiring a continuation of the nonconforming
use, but in no case shall such a permit be issued if its primary function is to
continue a monopoly.
   (C)   To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in
any location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which
the board deems reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare.
   (D)   To make a variance where, by reason of an exceptional situation,
surroundings or condition of a specific piece of property, or by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property of
record, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions the strict
application of any provision of the zoning title would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties or particular hardship upon the owner of
such property and amount to a practical confiscation of property, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience to such owner, provided such relief can
be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without
substantially impairing the general purpose and intent of the comprehensive
plan as established by the regulations and provisions contained in the zoning
title.
   (E)   To interpret the provisions of the zoning title where the street
layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the
district map fixing the several districts.
   (F)   To extend the period within which a nonconforming commercial or
industrial use is to be removed from a dwelling district, when the owner or
owners can furnish substantial proof that the building was so extensively
remodeled, reconstructed or structurally altered after the original
construction that it practically resulted in a new building, but such extension
of the period shall not exceed forty (40) years from the date of such
remodeling, reconstruction or structural alteration.
   (G)   To waive the parking requirements in the outlying business or the
industrial districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as
to make unnecessary the full provision of parking facilities or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
   (H)   To permit land within two hundred feet (200') of a multiple dwelling
to be improved for the parking spaces required in connection with a multiple
dwelling, but only when there is positive assurance that such land will be used
for such purpose during the existence of, and for the use of the occupants of,
the multiple dwelling.
   (I)   To permit a lot or tract to be subdivided and used by more than one
main building even though the width of the lot and other similar requirements
may not be fully complied with, but only when the distances between the
proposed use and other existing structures or lot lines conform to the minimum
requirements of the district in which the lot is located and when adequate
vehicular access can be provided. (Ord. 215, 9-17-1962)
A variance to construct or alter any building or structure granted pursuant to
this section shall terminate and shall be null and void unless construction of
such building or structure shall be substantially complete within one year from
the date the variance was granted by the zoning board of appeals or within such
other period of time specifically approved by the zoning board of appeals at
the time the variance is granted. The vote required to grant a specific period
of time for completion pursuant to this paragraph shall be by majority vote of
the zoning board of appeals. (Ord. 499, 12-8-1998)
2-2-7: VOTE REQUIRED:
In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to the zoning title 1
the board shall, before making any variation from the zoning title in a
specific case, first determine that the proposed variation will not impair an
adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or unreasonably increase
the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger
the public safety, or unreasonably diminish or impair established property
values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public
health, safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the village.
The concurring vote of four (4) members of the board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the building
official, or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is
authorized by the zoning title to render a decision. (Ord. 215, 9-17-1962)
 
Notes
1    See title 9 of this code.
2-2-8: NOTICE:
The board shall make no recommendation except in a specific case and after a
public hearing conducted by the board. A notice of the time and place of such
public hearing shall be published in a paper of general circulation in the
village at least fifteen (15) days previous to the hearing. Such notice shall
contain the address or location of the property for which the variation or
other ruling by the board is sought, as well as a brief description of the
nature of the appeal. (Ord. 215, 9-17-1962)

the applicant has been incorporated or organized for a period of not less than

prospective licensee making application, if the board of trustees believes that

which has been in existence not less than one year prior to making application,
would be in the best interests of the village and would further the intent of
the temporary license ordinance of the village and would further a charitable,
educational, or civic purpose, and such benefits would outweigh any detriment
which may be caused by granting a temporary license to a not for profit
corporation or organization which has not been in existence under the laws of
the state of Illinois for the stated purposes for a period of not less than one
year prior to making the application.
   (C)   Term Of License: A temporary license may be issued for a period not to
exceed three (3) consecutive calendar days and shall be subject to the

      3.   A statement setting forth the purpose for the issuance of said
license;
      4.   A statement setting forth the applicant's arrangements for crowd
control;
      5.   Certificate of insurance showing evidence of dramshop and liability

limited outdoor use area without permission from the liquor control
commissioner. The licensee shall keep the limited outdoor use area free of

commissioner only after an affirmative recommendation by the board of trustees.

(D)3 of this section, as the case may be, to the village within thirty (30)
days from the date of the occurrence of any changes in the information provided
by the telecommunications provider in the registration form or most recent
return on file with the village.
   (C)   Fee Imposed:
      1.   A village telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee is
hereby imposed upon all telecommunications retailers in the amount of one
percent (1%) of all gross charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to
service addresses within the village for telecommunications originating or
received in the village.
      2.   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this section, the village infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights of way within the village by telecommunications retailers.
Imposition of the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this section
does not, however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or
imposition of any fees otherwise authorized by law.
      3.   The village telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized by this section shall be collected, enforced, and administered as
set forth in subsection (D)4 of this section.
   (D)   Collection, Enforcement, And Administration:
      1.   A telecommunications retailer shall charge to and collect from each
customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the village infrastructure
maintenance fee attributable to that customer's service address.
      2.   Unless otherwise approved by the village president, the
infrastructure maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications
retailer to the village not later than the last day of the month subsequent to
the month in which a bill is issued to the customer; provided, however, that
the telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed two percent
(2%) of the village infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to reimburse
itself for expenses incurred in accounting for and remitting the fee.
      3.   Remittance of the municipal infrastructure fee to the village shall
be accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the village
president, which shall contain such information as the village president may
reasonably require.
      4.   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant
to this section and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by such
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the village. The charge imposed under subsection
(D)1 of this section by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this
section shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications
retailer who provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable
at law in the same manner as the original charge for such services.
      5.   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee
has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this section, whether as
a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be
credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this section, from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the village president may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three (3) years
after the date of the erroneous payment unless: a) the credit is used only to
offset a claim of underpayment made by the village within the applicable
statutory period of limitations, and b) the credit derives from an overpayment
made by the same telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory
period of limitations.
      6.   Amounts paid under this section by telecommunications retailers
shall not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts as
described immediately below:
         (a)   Gross charges for purposes of the telecommunications excise tax
act;
         (b)   Gross receipts for purposes of the municipal utility tax as
prescribed in 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/8-11-2;
         (c)   Gross charges for purposes of the municipal telecommunications
tax as prescribed in 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/8-11-17;
         (d)   Gross revenue for purposes of the tax on annual gross revenue of
public utilities prescribed in 220 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/2-202.
      7.   The village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the
books and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this section
to determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to
the village for the village infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of
the amount of the village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the village by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the village plus five percent
(5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any
costs incurred by the village in conducting the audit, in an amount not to
exceed five percent (5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in
an audit. Said sum shall be paid to the village within twenty one (21) days
after the date of issuance of an invoice for same.
      8.   The village president, or his or her designee, may promulgate such
further or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement
of this section, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time
to time and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered
pursuant to subsection (B) of this section of such regulations.
   (E)   Compliance With Other Laws: Nothing in this section shall excuse any
person or entity from obligations imposed under any law, including, but not
limited to:
      1.   Generally applicable taxes; and
      2.   Standards for construction on, over, under, or within, use of or
repair of the public rights of way, including standards relating to
freestanding towers and other structures upon the public rights of way, as
provided; and
      3.   Any liability imposed for the failure to comply with such generally
applicable taxes or standards governing construction on, over, under, or
within, use of or repair of the public rights of way; and
      4.   Compliance with any ordinance or provision of this code concerning
uses or structures not located on, over, or within the right of way.
   (F)   Existing Franchises And Licenses: Any franchise, license, or similar
agreements between telecommunications retailers and the village entered into
before the effective date of this section regarding the use of public rights of
way shall remain valid according to and for their stated terms except for any
fees, charges or other compensation to the extent waived.
   (G)   Penalties: Any telecommunications provider who violates, disobeys,
omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this section
shall be subject to fine in accordance with the general penalty provisions of
this code.
   (H)   Enforcement: Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting
any additional or further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of
this section.
   (I)   Severability: If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or
portion of this section is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate,
distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions hereof.
   (J)   Conflict: This section supersedes all sections or parts of sections
adopted prior hereto which are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such
conflicts.
   (K)   Waiver And Fee Implementation:
      1.   The village hereby waives all fees, charges, and other compensation
that may accrue, after the effective date of the waiver, to the village by a
telecommunications retailer pursuant to any existing village franchise,
license, or similar agreement with a telecommunications retailer during the
time the village imposes the telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee.
This waiver shall only be effective during the time the infrastructure
maintenance fee provided for in this section is subject to being lawfully
imposed on the telecommunications retailer and collected by the
telecommunications retailer from the customer.
      2.   The village clerk shall send a notice of the waiver by certified
mail/return receipt requested to each telecommunications retailer with whom the
village has a franchise.
      3.   The village infrastructure maintenance fee provided for in this
section shall become effective and imposed on the first day of the month not
less than ninety (90) days after the village provides written notice by

existing franchise, license, or similar agreement that the village waives all
compensation under such existing franchise, license, or similar agreement
during such time as the fee is subject to being lawfully imposed and collected

created by ordinance 490 is voided by court action, the provisions of section
3-6-4 of this chapter repealed in subsection (J) of this section shall remain
in effect in all respects as if it had never been amended by this section, and

to this section shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to the gross
receipts utility tax as it existed prior to the passage of this section.
   (J)   Exception: All reference to the tax imposed in section

within the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late
filing penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown
as due on a return shall be imposed, and a late payment penalty of five percent
(5%) of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance.
   (L)   Abatement: The local tax administrator shall have the authority to
waive or abate any late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file
penalty if the local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists
for delay or failure to make a filing.
   (M)   Installment Contracts: The village may enter into an installment
contract with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the controlling tax
ordinance. The local tax administrator may not cancel any installment contract
so entered unless the taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon
written notice by the local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30)
days delinquent, the taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any
delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen
(14) day period or fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the
installment contract with the local administrator, the installment contract
shall be canceled without further notice to the taxpayer.
   (N)   Statute Of Limitations: The village, through the local tax
administrator, shall review all tax returns in a prompt and timely manner and
inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing. The taxpayer shall have forty
five (45) days after receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any
request for refund or provide any tax still due and owing.
      1.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
(4) years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
      2.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years after the end of the calendar
year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar
year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
      3.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer.
   (O)   Voluntary Disclosure: For any locally imposed and administered tax for
which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation,
or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file
an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of
the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to
pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month,
for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four
(4) years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid
voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax,
interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed.
However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax
due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable
interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud
on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed
invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than
ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or
the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional
amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid
under this section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final
determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed
or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.
   (P)   Publication Of Tax Ordinances: Any locally administered tax ordinance
shall be published via normal or standard publishing requirements. The posting
of a tax ordinance on the internet shall satisfy the publication requirements.
Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request
at the village clerk's office.
   (Q)   Internal Review Procedure: The local tax administrator shall establish
an internal review procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers
for unpaid taxes. Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the
lien is valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is
determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall:
      1.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
      2.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
      3.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
   (R)   Conflicting Tax Provisions: This section shall be liberally construed
and administered to supplement all of the village's tax ordinances. To the
extent that any tax ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this
section, this section shall be controlling. (Ord. 532, 12-12-2000)

CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required
include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations),
schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major roads
and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or electrical
transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals,
petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances).
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate including, but not necessarily
limited to:
   (A)   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building;
   (B)   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
   (C)   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days per year;

completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the

inundation by the base flood. The floodplains of Erie are generally identified
as such on panel numbers 17195C0287E and 17195CO0289E of the countywide flood
insurance rate map of Whiteside County prepared by the federal emergency
management agency and dated February 18, 2011. Floodplain also includes those
areas of known flooding as identified by the community.
The floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Whiteside County that are
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Erie or that may be annexed into
Erie are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared
for Whiteside County by the federal emergency management agency and dated

occurred.
SFHA: See definition of Floodplain And Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other
improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a
substantial improvement, actual start of construction means the first

structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
   (B)   Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.
The term does not include:
   (A)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   (B)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or the Illinois register of historic places.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the required federal, state, and/or local permits
and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided. (Ord. 655, 1-11-2011)

delineated as an "A zone" on the countywide flood insurance rate map of
Whiteside County shall be according to the best data available from federal,
state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must
be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations.
   (D)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of those parts of
unincorporated Whiteside County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of Erie, or that may be annexed into Erie, shall be as delineated
on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Whiteside County

elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to
be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled
after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is not in the
floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood
elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current flood
insurance rate map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   The building permit director shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate
map identification.
   The building permit director shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or
permit not required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The
building permit director shall not issue a permit unless all other federal,
state, and local permits have been obtained. (Ord. 655, 1-11-2011; amd. Ord.

4-3-10: CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION:
For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained.
In addition, Erie shall notify adjacent communities in writing thirty (30) days
prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the
watercourse. (Ord. 655, 1-11-2011)
4-3-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the board of appeals for a
variance. The board of appeals shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Erie board of trustees. The
board of trustees may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it
deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP.
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   The board of appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of section
4-3-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
4-3-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
4-3-6 and
4-3-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 655, 1-11-2011)
4-3-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
Erie or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from
proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder. (Ord. 655, 1-11-2011)
4-3-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the building permit director
may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists.
The building permit director shall notify the owner in writing of such
violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   Erie shall make application to the circuit court for an injunction
requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the court
deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   Erie shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   (B)   The building permit director shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      The building permit director is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in
writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if
necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop
work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked
until a hearing is held by the board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
      At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present
evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of
appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent Erie from taking such other lawful action
to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue
to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 655, 1-11-2011; amd. Ord. 803, 5-

or any fraction thereof rounded to the nearest one cent ($0.01). (For example,
the charge for one thousand and two (1,002) gallons used would be the sum of
sixty-one dollars and two cents ($61.02): fifty-five dollars ($55,00) for the

commercial building, residence or other premises shall be such as to impose a
burden upon the sewage treatment plant and system in addition to the burden
imposed by the average sewage entering into the sewerage system, or in cases
where a private water supply is used and returned to the sewerage system, then
the president and board of trustees reserve the right to enter into separate
contracts with such industrial user, commercial building, residence or other
premises for special rates and charges where the particular circumstances under

meters for each unit, such as apartment buildings, trailer courts, or
commercial and residential units located within the same building. In all such
cases, the total amount of water used as shown by the water meter for any two
(2) or more units shall be divided by the number of units in said building and
the rates above provided shall be applied as if each unit had a separate meter
and were using an equal amount of water.

and severally liable therefor to the village. All bills for service shall be
rendered bimonthly as of the first day of the month succeeding the period for
which the service is billed, and shall be payable not later than the close of

   (A)   Penalty Bill (Yellow): If payment of the full amount of the bill is
not made by the due date of the bill which shall be hereinafter referred to as
the "white bill", then the billing addressee will be notified of the ten
percent (10%) penalty by the mailing of a yellow postcard which will allow an
additional ten (10) days for the bill plus the penalty to be paid. If the
billing addressee is a tenant, the owner will be sent a notice informing the
owner the tenant is overdue on the utility services billing and the
consequences if the bill is not paid. If in the opinion of the village
president or his or her designee, the balance owed is not of a sufficiently
large amount to justify the administrative costs required to collect said
balance, the balance can be retained on the account and will become payable on
rendition of the next bill. Such determination to retain balances on account
will be made following guidelines put forth by the village president in a
standing order. Said standing order may be amended from time to time as is
determined by the village president to be prudent. If upon expiration of the

plus penalty is not made by the due date of the yellow postcard bill, then a
red tag will be attached to the front door of the service address warning that
the water service will be shut off if the full amount of the bill including
penalties and the red tag fee, in an amount as set forth in the schedule of
fees maintained on file and available for public inspection at the office of
the village clerk, is not paid in full by twelve o'clock (12:00) noon the next
working day. The village may proceed with termination of water service at one
minute past twelve o'clock (12:01) P.M. the next working day following the
termination warning unless the person so notified shall request a hearing in
writing and shall deliver the written request to the village president or
deliver the written request in person to the village office to an employee of
the village prior to twelve o'clock (12:00) noon the next working day following
the day that the termination warning is attached to the front door of the
service address. The hearing shall be held by the village president or a person
so designated.

justified, or unless other arrangements for payment of the bill are approved by
the village president or his or her designee, the village may proceed with
termination of the water service on the date stated in the termination notice.

collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations,
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR

on Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      6.   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable

      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.

   a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other
than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on
the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
   b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height

comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on

within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or

all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter.
A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on the
effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the Village
makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two

and occupancy permit specifically permitting the proposed use has first been
obtained.
   (B)   Application for such permit shall be made in writing to the building
official and shall specify with particularity the particular mobile home
proposed to be parked and contain an accurate description of the land to be so
used and of the particular location on the land where the mobile home is
proposed to be parked. It may be accompanied by a consent in writing of all

form and the proposed location and mobile home conforms to the requirements
above set forth for the granting of a permit by the building official and
further finds that the parking of the mobile home proposed at the location
proposed will not produce any fire hazard, cause undue congestion, tend to
produce a deterioration in the character of the neighborhood or tend to reduce
the value of the adjoining property, they shall grant the permit, otherwise the
same shall be denied. (Ord. 641, 12-8-2009)

9-10-3: PROCEDURE:
In planning and developing a subdivision, the general principles and
requirements set forth in section
9-10-8 of this chapter shall be observed except otherwise provided in
9-10-7. In every case the following procedure should be pursued:
   (A)   Sketch Plan: The subdivider or his engineer shall first submit the
proposed plat in sketch form to the plats officer at a village board meeting to
ascertain the location of proposed streets, parks or other planned
improvements.
   (B)   Preliminary Plat:
      1.   The subdivider, after submitting the plat in sketch form to the
plats officer shall prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision and
construction plans for improvements adequate to determine that sewer, water and
street construction can be installed conforming with the requirements set forth
in section
9-10-9 of this chapter. The subdivider shall supply black or blue line prints
to all public utilities. The subdivider shall file with the plats officer an
application in writing seeking the approval of said plat, accompanied by four
(4) black line or blue line prints.
      2.   The plats officer will check the preliminary plat as to its
conformity with the adopted community development plan, ordinances of the
community, and principles, standards and requirements set forth in this
chapter. The plats officer will check the construction plans of proposed
improvements.
      3.   The village board, upon receipt of the recommendations and advice
from the plats officer concerning matters above, will approve as presented,
approve with modifications, or disapprove the preliminary plat within thirty
(30) days of receipt of the plat. If the preliminary plat is disapproved by the
village board, the subdivider shall be furnished with a letter and copy of the
plat stating the reason for disapproval and where the plat does not conform to
village code provisions including the community development plan. Such
notification shall take place within the thirty (30) day period. Upon approval
of the preliminary plat, one copy of the approved or conditionally approved
plat shall be returned to the subdivider within ten (10) days following the
village board action, one copy of the approved plat transmitted to the county
superintendent of highways, and the final copy retained in the board's files.
   (C)   Improvements: The subdivider, after approval of the preliminary plat,
may: 1) secure from the plats officer the necessary permits to proceed with the
street and sanitary improvements after approval of final construction drawings;
or in lieu of this, 2) shall, to ensure the satisfactory installation of said
improvements in accordance with this chapter post with the village clerk a
surety bond, in form prescribed by the village board sufficient to cover the
full cost of said improvements based upon estimate approved by the village
board.
   (D)   Final Plat:
      1.   The subdivider, upon completion of all improvements required by this
chapter, or upon posting of a bond, shall file with the plats officer the final
or record plat for final approval. The plat must conform in every respect with
the requirements specified in section
9-10-6 of this chapter. The subdivider shall submit the final plat not later
than one year after approval of the preliminary plat. A final or record plat
may be a portion of a larger subdivision for which a preliminary plat had been
previously approved. However, improvements shall be made for all parts of the
subdivision to be submitted for final approval.
      2.   The subdivider shall file with the plats officer five (5) black line
or blue line prints, the original tracing, and a formal request for approval,
along with two (2) copies of all covenants or restrictions pertaining to the
final plat.
The plats officer will check the final plat and plans and specifications for
improvements. If found satisfactory, the original tracing shall be forwarded to
the village board, with a certificate showing that: a) the technical details of
the plat itself have been checked and found satisfactory, b) all required
improvements have been satisfactorily completed or, in lieu thereof, a surety
bond has been posted, assuring their installation.
      3.   After receiving notification from the plats officer that
improvements are in order and after being satisfied that the final plat is in
conformity with the approved preliminary plat and this chapter, the village
board shall approve and certify the final plat. The village board shall have
sixty (60) days from the date of submission in which to take action on the
final plat.
      4.   After approval of the plat by the board, four (4) approved prints
and original tracing of the final plat shall be returned to the plats officer.
The plats officer shall transmit copies of the approved plat to the county
superintendent of highways and such other agencies as deemed necessary and
retain one for the board's files. The original tracing shall be transmitted to
the subdivider for recording.
      5.   The subdivider shall post a maintenance bond covering any
improvement to be accepted for maintenance by the village. Such bond shall be
held by the village clerk and shall become effective upon acceptance of the
final plat by the village board, unless otherwise stipulated. Maintenance bonds
shall run for two (2) years on sewer and water improvements.
   (E)   Fees:
      1.   At the time of filing of a plat or replat for approval, the
subdivider shall pay to the village clerk a fee according to the schedule of
fees maintained on file and available for public inspection at the office of
the village clerk.
      2.   All fees shall be deposited in the general fund. No fees shall be

safeguarded by appropriate restrictions, and which, in the judgment of the
board makes adequate provision for all essential community requirements;
provided, however, that no modification shall be granted by the board which
would conflict with the proposals of an existing community redevelopment plan,
if any, or with the intent and purposes of said general principles of design
and minimum requirements.
In any particular case where the subdivider can show that by reason of
exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, strict compliance with
any requirements of this chapter could cause practical difficulty or
exceptional and undue hardship, the village board may modify such requirement
to the extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such difficulty or
hardship; provided such relief may be granted without detriment to the public
good and without impairing the intent and purposes of this chapter or the
desirable general development of the community.
Any modification thus granted shall be entered in the minutes of the village
board setting forth the reasons which, in the opinion of the board, justified
the modification.
   (B)   In the case of a subdivision of less than five (5) lots and where all
lots can be adequately served by existing streets, situated in a locality where
conditions are well defined, the village board may exempt the subdivider from
complying with requirements stipulated in section 9-10-4 of this chapter
pertaining to the preparation of the preliminary plat. (Ord. 296, 10-24-1972;
amd. Ord. 779, 12-13-2022)
9-10-8: DESIGN; LAYOUT:
In laying out a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the following
general principles and requirements:
   (A)   General:
      1.   The layout must conform to a transportation plan adopted by the
village, other parts of the adopted community development plan and other
adopted regulations of the village. Where a proposed park, playground or other
recreational area, proposed school site or public ground, shown on the adopted
community development plan, is located in whole or in part within the proposed
subdivision, such proposed public ground or part, if not dedicated to the board
of education or other public agency, must be reserved and no action taken on
the subdivision for a period of not less than ninety (90) days to allow the
village board or other public agency the opportunity to consider and take
action toward acquisition of such public ground or park by purchase or other
means. If the responsible agency does not take action to acquire such land, the
subdivider may then use the land for any purpose permitted.
      2.   Where considered desirable by the subdivider and held appropriate by
the village board, open spaces suitably located and of adequate size for parks,
playgrounds or other recreational purposes for local or neighborhood use may be
provided for in the design of the proposed subdivision, and if not dedicated to
the public and accepted by the appropriate public body, may be reserved for the
common use of all property owners in the proposed subdivision by covenant in
the deeds.
   (B)   The Street And Block Layout:
      1.   The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining and nearby
areas.
         (a)   Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be
continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.
         (b)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the village board, such extension is
not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with existing layouts or the most advantageous future development
of adjacent tracts. Cul-de-sacs of reasonable length will be approved where
topography necessitates or where they appropriate for the type of development
contemplated.
         (c)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
         (d)   Wherever there exists adjoining the tract to be subdivided a
dedicated or platted and recorded half width street or alley, the other half
width of such street or alley shall be platted.
         (e)   Alleys shall ordinarily be platted: 1) in the rear of all lots
to be used for business; and 2) in the rear of residential lots fronting on
primary thoroughfares (unless service roads are provided in front thereof) as a
means of safe access to such lots.
      2.   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of
lots at least one hundred feet (100') in depth, unless, in the opinion of the
board, prevented by exceptional topography or other physical conditions.
         (a)   The lengths of blocks shall be such as are appropriate, in the
opinion of the village board, for the locality and the type of development
contemplated, but shall not exceed one thousand two hundred feet (1,200').
         (b)   In any block over seven hundred feet (700') in length, the board
may require that a crosswalk or pedestrianway, not less than ten feet (10')
wide, be provided near the center and entirely across such block.
         (c)   Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed five hundred feet (500') in length
measured along the centerline from the intersection at origin through the end
of the circle to the end of the right of way.
   (C)   Minimum Right Of Way Widths Of Streets, Alleys And Easements For
Utilities:
      1.   Street: Not less than sixty feet (60') wide in any case.
      2.   Street And Cul-De-Sac: The village board in its discretion may
permit a street with curb and gutter and fifty feet (50') in width. All dead-
end streets shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right of
way diameter of one hundred feet (100').
      3.   Alleys And Service Drives: Twenty feet (20') wide.
      4.   Easements for utilities, where required, should be at least ten feet
(10') wide centered on rear or side lot lines.
   (D)   Minimum Surface Widths: The portion of the surface required to be
installed at the subdivider's expense shall be as follows:
      1.   Streets designated on an adopted transportation plan or approved by
the village board. Overall surface widths shall be as designated by an adopted
transportation plan or by the village board, and the differences, if any,
between the cost of the portion to be provided at the expense of the subdivider
and that of the total width designated by the transportation plan or the
village board shall be borne by the municipality, unless it shall be determined
by the village board that such greater width will benefit the subdivider in
proportion to its cost. The surface of a turning circle at the end of a cul-de-
sac shall have a minimum outside diameter of eighty feet (80'). A "T" or "Y"
shaped surfaced space, when approved by the board may be used as a temporary

CHAPTER 16
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
SECTION:
9-16-1: Purpose
9-16-2: Applicability
9-16-3: Stormwater Management Plans
9-16-4: Other Pre-Ordinance Drainage Conditions
9-16-5: General Provisions
9-16-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this Chapter is to reduce or eliminate the hazards to the public
health and safety caused by excessive stormwater runoff, reduce the effects of
soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development, reduce economic losses to
individuals and the community at large, enhance broader social and economic
objectives, and protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land
and water resources. The provisions of this Chapter shall be deemed as
additional requirements to standards required by other provisions of the Erie
Municipal Code and an applicant must comply with all other applicable laws. In
cases of conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply. (Ord. 778,
12-13-2022)
9-16-2: APPLICABILITY:
A stormwater management plan shall be required for any new residential
developments resulting in a gross aggregate impervious lot coverage of fifty
percent (50%) or more; new residential developments having two (2) or more
dwelling units; and for any new commercial, industrial, institutional or
utility developments. No final subdivision plat shall be approved and no zoning
certificates shall be issued until and unless the stormwater management plan
has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Trustees (“Board”) of the
Village of Erie (“Village”). (Ord. 778, 12-13-2022)
9-16-3: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLANS:
The required stormwater management plan shall identify means for controlling
the stormwater runoff release rate (the rate of stormwater runoff released from
dominant to servient land) from the development and providing storage potential
for the excess stormwater runoff (where required). All computations, plans and
specifications related to the implementation of this Chapter must be prepared
and sealed by a professional engineer, registered in Illinois. The stormwater
management plan shall contain, but not be limited to, the following
information, unless specifically excluded by the Board:
   (A)   A topographic map of the project site and adjacent areas, of suitable
scale and contour interval, which shall define the location of streams, the
extent of floodplains and calculated high water elevations, the shoreline of
lakes, ponds, swamps and detention basins including their inflow and outflow
structures, if any.
   (B)   The location and flowline elevation of all existing sanitary, storm,
or combined sewers.
   (C)   Detailed determination of runoff anticipated for the entire project
site following development, indicating design volumes and rates of proposed
runoff for each portion of the watershed tributary to the storm drainage
system, the calculations used to determine said runoff volumes and rates and
restatement of the criteria which have been used by the project engineer
throughout his calculations.
   (D)   A layout of the proposed stormwater management system including the
location and size of all drainage structures, storm sewers, channels and
channel sections, detention basins, and analyses regarding the effect said
improvements shall have upon the receiving channel and its high-water
elevation.
   (E)   The slope, type, and size of all existing and proposed storm sewers
and other waterways.
   (F)   For all stormwater management facilities (which shall include any
structure designated to collect or store surface water), a plot or tabulation
of storage volumes, for the design capacity, with corresponding water surface
elevations and the facility outflow rates for those water surface elevations.
   (G)   An erosion and sedimentation control plan showing: All erosion and
sedimentation control measures necessary to meet the objectives of this Chapter
and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) throughout all
phases of construction and permanently after completion of development of the
site. Provisions for maintenance of temporary and permanent control facilities,
including easements. Identification of the person(s) or entity which shall have
legal and financial responsibility for maintenance of permanent, erosion
control structures and measures after development is completed, and such
identification and/or any subsequent changes thereto should be provided to the
Board. Provisions shall be made to revise this information, upon any change in
related ownership and/or cited responsibility.
   (H)   A reference elevation benchmark (which shall be a permanent, frost-
proof monument approved by the Village) shall be established in the near
vicinity to the stormwater management facility and shall be referenced on the
plan. (Ord. 778, 12-13-2022)
9-16-4: OTHER PRE-ORDINANCE DRAINAGE CONDITIONS:
Upon passage of this Chapter, drainage conditions in residential, commercial
and industrial areas, in the Village shall be considered established as
existing drainage conditions. Changes to these existing, drainage conditions,
through improvements, which have an adverse effect on adjoining or neighboring
properties, shall be considered as a violation of this Chapter. The Zoning
Enforcing Officer shall have the authority to investigate such changes when
complaints are filed with the Village. The Zoning Enforcing Officer shall
require that pre-ordinance drainage conditions be re-established. (Ord. 778,
12-13-2022)
9-16-5: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   (A)   The Board may require the applicant to post a performance security
instrument, as approved by the Village Attorney, in an amount sufficient to
ensure the execution of the stormwater management plan.
   (B)   Maintenance of stormwater management facilities located on private
property shall be the responsibility of the owner(s) in that development and
the Board may require the applicant to execute a maintenance agreement.
   (C)   A fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00), plus five dollars ($5.00) per
acre over five (5) acres, shall accompany the submittal of each Stormwater
Management Plan for review.
   (D)   The interpretation and application of the provisions of this Chapter
shall be held to be the minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed
in favor of the Village and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any
other powers granted by the State statutes.
   (E)   Upon completion of the stormwater management project, the developer’s
engineer and the President shall affix their signatures to a set of the
stormwater management plans which has been annotated to show any approved
changes made to the plan during construction. This set of plans will constitute
the final stormwater management plans for the project and will be used for
future determinations regarding maintenance needs.
   (F)   A professional engineer, hired by the developer, shall be responsible
for determining whether the stormwater management plan is in conformance with
this Chapter and the approved stormwater management plan, and whether
development is proceeding in accordance with the approved stormwater management
plan. Periodic inspection of the development site shall be made by the
developer’s engineer to ensure compliance. All Village employees or agents
shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection,
observation, and measurement, in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter.
   (G)   The Village shall have the power to enforce this Chapter and the
