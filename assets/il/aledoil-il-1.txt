1-2-3: COURT PROCEEDINGS:
No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance,
whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense

incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes
effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the

This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions

pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the city herein repealed
and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this code shall be

provision; nor shall this chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,

provided further that the Mayor may, at any time, declare that the state of
emergency has ended.

      1.   The city council adopted tax increment financing pursuant to the
provisions of the act referred to in section
1-17-1 of this chapter in respect to the redevelopment project area described
in section
1-17-2 of this chapter, and all conditions and provisions of the act and
amendment have been complied with since the adoption of tax increment financing
to the date of this chapter.
      2.   The redevelopment project area would not reasonably be developed
without the use of the incremental revenues arising under the municipal
retailers' occupation tax act, the municipal service occupation tax act, the
retailers' occupation tax act, the use tax act, the service use tax act, and
the service occupation tax act.
      3.   The increment arising under the act and amendment described in
subsection (A)1 of this section will be exclusively utilized for the
development of the redevelopment project area.
      4.   The city has imposed the maximum tax allowed by law under the
municipal retailers' occupation tax act, the municipal use tax act, and the
municipal service tax act.
   (B)   The city hereby elects to utilize those incremental revenues arising
under the act and amendment described in subsection (A)2 of this section, for
the purpose of implementing the redevelopment plan and project for the
development of the redevelopment project.
   (C)   Pursuant to section 11-74.4-a(i) of the act, the department of revenue
of the state of Illinois is hereby authorized to annually certify and cause to
be paid to the city an amount equal to the increase in the aggregate amount of
taxes paid by retailers and servicemen on transactions at places of business
located within the redevelopment project area, pursuant to the retailers'
occupation tax act, the use tax act, the service use tax act, and the service
occupation tax act, for as long as the redevelopment project area exists, over
and above the aggregate amount of such taxes as certified by the Illinois
department of revenue and paid under those acts by retailers and servicemen on
transactions at places of business located in the redevelopment project area
during the base year, which shall be the calendar year immediately prior to the
year in which the municipality adopted tax increment allocation financing, less
one and six-tenths percent (1.6%) of such amounts, which sum shall be retained
by the state treasurer to cover the costs incurred by the department of revenue
in administering and enforcing the amendment.
   (D)   The city shall deposit in its special tax allocation fund all
incremental revenues from the municipal retailers' occupation tax act, the
municipal service occupation tax act, and local real property taxes, received

12-22-1986)
1-17-5: STATE SALES TAX REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA:
   (A)   The city council hereby makes the following findings:
      1.   The city council specifically finds that the city has imposed the
maximum tax allowed by law under the municipal retailers' occupation tax act,
the municipal use tax act and the municipal service occupation tax act.
      2.   The area constituting the proposed state sales tax boundary in the
city is described in exhibit "A" attached to the ordinance codified herein and
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof as if set forth
verbatim in this section.
      3.   There exist conditions that cause the Aledo tax increment
redevelopment project area on the whole, and the area proposed to be designated
as the state sales tax boundary in particular, to be classified as a blighted/
conservation area as those terms are defined in section 11-74.4-3 of the act,
as amended.
      4.   The Aledo tax increment redevelopment project area on the whole, and
the state sales tax boundary in particular, has not been subject to growth and
development through investment by private enterprise and would not reasonably
be anticipated to be developed without the adoption of the tax increment
redevelopment plan and projects and without the use of tax incremental revenues
as recited in the preamble to the ordinance codified herein.
      5.   The tax increment redevelopment plan and projects for the city
conform to the comprehensive plan for the development of the city as a whole.
      6.   The city is a labor surplus municipality and implementation of the
redevelopment plan and projects will reduce unemployment, create new jobs, and
by provision of new facilities, enhance the tax base of the taxing districts
that extend into the redevelopment project area and proposed state sales tax
boundary.
      7.   The Aledo tax increment redevelopment project area as a whole, and
the state sales tax boundary in particular, would not reasonably be developed
without the use of incremental revenues derived from ad valorem taxes under
section 11-74.4-8 of the act and without the use of incremental revenues
derived from the retailers' occupation tax act, use tax act and service use tax
act and the service occupation tax act under section 11-74.4-8a(1) of the act,
the aggregate amount of such taxes to be certified by and received from the
Illinois department of revenue and paid under those acts by retailers and
servicemen on transactions in places of business located in the state sales tax
boundary.
      8.   The city council specifically finds that any incremental revenues
derived from ad valorem taxes under section 11-74.4-8 of the act and
incremental revenues derived from the municipal sales tax increment as defined
under section 11-74.8-3(h) of the act paid by retailers and servicemen on
transactions at places of business located within the state sales tax boundary
as certified by and received from the Illinois department of revenue under
section 11-74.4-8a(1) of the act shall be deposited into a "special tax
allocation fund of the city of Aledo" and used exclusively for the development
of the redevelopment project area as provided in the act as now in force or as
may hereinafter be amended. In addition, if the city so elects (such election
to be made annually), the city shall deposit in such fund any other municipal
sales tax increment resulting from taxes paid by retailers and servicemen on
transactions at places of businesses located within the redevelopment project
area but not within the state sales tax boundary as provided in section 11-
74.4-8a(1) as now in force or as may hereinafter be amended.
      9.   The city council specifically finds that any revenues derived from
the state sales tax increment as defined under section 11-74.4-8a(1) of the act
as certified by and received from the Illinois department of revenue under
section 11-74.4-3(s) of the act shall be deposited into a "special tax
allocation fund of the city of Aledo" and used exclusively for the development
of the state sales tax boundary as provided in the act as now in force or as
may hereinafter be amended.
      10.   The Aledo tax increment redevelopment project area on the whole,
and the proposed state sales tax boundary in particular, includes only those
contiguous parcels of real property and improvements thereon substantially
benefited by the proposed redevelopment plan and projects.
   (B)   The Aledo tax increment redevelopment project area is amended for the
purpose of establishing as the state sales tax boundary pursuant to section 11-
74.4-3(r), section 11-74.4-4 and section 11-74.4-8a(1) of the tax increment
allocation redevelopment act 1 , as amended, the area described in exhibit A
attached to the ordinance codified herein and incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof as if set forth verbatim in this section.
   (C)   The Aledo tax increment redevelopment project area, except as amended
herein solely for the purpose of establishing the state sales tax boundary,
shall remain in full force and effect as to all the area originally described
and designated pursuant to special ordinance 14-86. (Ord. 11/89, 10-2-1989)

IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM
SECTION:
1-21-1:   Adoption
1-21-2:   Purpose And Definitions
1-21-3:   Identification Of Red Flags
1-21-4:   Detecting Red Flags
1-21-5:   Preventing And Mitigating Identity Theft
1-21-6:   Protecting Customer Identifying Information
1-21-7:   Updates
1-21-8:   Administration
1-21-1: ADOPTION:
The city of Aledo, Illinois ("city") developed this identity theft prevention
program ("program") pursuant to the federal trade commission's red flags rule
("rule"), which implements section 114 of the fair and accurate credit
transactions act of 2003 (16 CFR section 681.2). This program was developed
with oversight and approval of the city council. After consideration of the
size and complexity of the city's operations and account systems, and the
nature and scope of the city's activities, the city council determined that
this program was appropriate for the city of Aledo, Illinois, and therefore
approved this program on April 20, 2009. (Ord. 04-20-09-2, 4-20-2009)
1-21-2: PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS:
   (A)   Requirements Of The Red Flags Rule: Under the red flag rule, every
financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft
prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its
operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to:
      1.   Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts
and incorporate those red flags into the program;
      2.   Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program;
      3.   Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent
and mitigate identity theft; and
      4.   Ensure the program is updated periodically to reflect changes in
risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of creditors from identity
theft.
   (B)   Red Flags Rule Definitions: The red flags rule defines "identity
theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person"
and a "red flag" as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates
the possible existence of identity theft.
   According to the rule, a municipal utility is a creditor subject to the rule
requirements. The rule defines creditors "to include finance companies,
automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and telecommunications
companies. Where nonprofit and government entities defer payment for goods or
services, they, too, are to be considered creditors".
   All the city's accounts that are individual utility service accounts held by
customers of the utility whether residential, commercial or industrial are
covered by the rule. Under the rule, a "covered account" is:
      1.   Any account the city offers or maintains primarily for personal,
family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions;
and
      2.   Any other account the city offers or maintains for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the
city from identity theft.
"Identifying information" is defined under the rule as "any name or number that
may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a
specific person", including: name, address, telephone number, social security
number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification
number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or
taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number,
computer's internet protocol address, or routing code. (Ord. 04-20-09-2, 4-20-
2009)
1-21-3: IDENTIFICATION OF RED FLAGS:
The city has considered the guidelines and the illustrative examples of
possible red flags from the FTC's identity theft rules and has reviewed the
municipality's past history with instances of identity theft, if any. The city
hereby determines that the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of
this program given the relative size of the city and the limited nature and
scope of the services that the city provides to its citizens:
   (A)   Notifications And Warnings From Credit Reporting Agencies:
      1.   Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;
      2.   Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a

      2.   Identification document or card on which a person's photograph or
physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document;
      3.   Other document with information that is not consistent with existing
customer information (such as if a person's signature on a check appears
forged); and
      4.   Application for service that appears to have been altered or forged.
   (C)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information:
      1.   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other

credit report);
      3.   Identifying information presented that is the same as information
shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent;
      4.   Identifying information presented that is consistent with fraudulent
activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing address);
      5.   Social security number presented that is the same as one given by
another customer;
      6.   An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of
another person;
      7.   A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information
on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law social security
numbers must not be required); and
      8.   A person's identifying information is not consistent with the
information that is on file for the customer.
   (D)   Suspicious Account Activity Or Unusual Use Of Account:
      1.   Change of address for an account followed by a request to change the

enforcement or other person that it has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft. (Ord. 04-20-09-2, 4-20-2009)
1-21-4: DETECTING RED FLAGS:
   (A)   New Accounts: In order to detect any of the red flags identified above
associated with the opening of a new account, city personnel will take the
following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the
account:
      1.   Require certain identifying information such as name, date of birth,
residential or business address, principal place of business for an entity,
driver's license or other identification;
      2.   Verify the customer's identity (for instance, review a driver's
license or other identification card);
      3.   Review documentation showing the existence of a business entity; and
      4.   Independently contact the customer.
   (B)   Existing Accounts: In order to detect any of the red flags identified
above for an existing account, city personnel will take the following steps to
monitor transactions with an account:

(in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via e-mail);
      2.   Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses; and
      3.   Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment
purposes. (Ord. 04-20-09-2, 4-20-2009)
1-21-5: PREVENTING AND MITIGATING IDENTITY THEFT:
In the event city personnel detect any identified red flags, such personnel

posed by the red flag:

   (B)   Contact the customer;
   (C)   Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access to
accounts;
   (D)   Not open a new account;
   (E)   Close an existing account;
   (F)   Reopen an account with a new number;
   (G)   Notify the city finance director for determination of the appropriate
step(s) to take;
   (H)   Notify law enforcement; or
   (I)   Determine that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances. (Ord. 04-20-09-2, 4-20-2009)
1-21-6: PROTECTING CUSTOMER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:
In order to further prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with
respect to city accounts, the city will take the following steps with respect
to its internal operating procedures to protect customer identifying
information:
   (A)   Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that the
website is not secure;
   (B)   Ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and computer
files containing customer information;
   (C)   Ensure that office computers are password protected and that computer
screens lock after a set period of time;
   (D)   Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information;
   (E)   Request only the last four (4) digits of social security numbers (if
any);
   (F)   Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and
   (G)   Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are
necessary for utility purposes. (Ord. 04-20-09-2, 4-20-2009)
1-21-7: UPDATES:
This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in
risks to customers and the soundness of the city from identity theft. At least
every year, the city finance director will consider the city's experiences with
identity theft situations, changes in identity theft methods, changes in
identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts
the city maintains and changes in the city's business arrangements with other
entities. After considering these factors, the city finance director will
determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags,
are warranted. If warranted, the city finance director will present the city
council with his or her recommended changes and the city council will make a
determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the
program. (Ord. 04-20-09-2, 4-20-2009)
1-21-8: ADMINISTRATION:
   (A)   Oversight: The city finance director will be responsible for the
program administration, for ensuring appropriate training of city staff on the
program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags
and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which
steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances
and considering periodic changes to the program.
   (B)   Staff Training And Reports: City staff responsible for implementing
the program shall be trained either by or under the direction of the city
finance director in the detection of red flags, and the responsive steps to be
taken when a red flag is detected.
   (C)   Service Provider Arrangements: In the event the city engages a service
provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, the
city will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its
activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to
detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft:
      1.   Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and
procedures in place; and
      2.   Require, by contract, that service providers review the city's
program and report any red flags to the city finance director.
   (D)   Specific Program Elements And Confidentiality: For the effectiveness
of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of
confidentiality regarding the city's specific practices relating to identity
theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program,
knowledge of such specific practices are to be limited to the city finance
director and those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing
identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus
publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific
practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection,
implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document.
   (E)   Other Legal Requirements: Awareness of the following related legal
requirements should be maintained:
      1.   31 USC 5318(g): Reporting of suspicious activities.
      2.   15 USC 1681c-1(h): Identity theft prevention; fraud alerts and
active duty alerts; limitations on use of information for credit extensions.
      3.   15 USC 1681s-2: Responsibilities of furnishers of information to
consumer reporting agencies.
      4.   15 USC 1681m: Requirements on use of consumer reports. (Ord. 04-20-
09-2, 4-20-2009)

who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be

telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.

in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees,
or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving

authorized by this chapter.

value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupations tax act. (Ord. 7/02, 9-16-2002)

retail from a retailer.
   (B)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of two
percent (2%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be
allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such
other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state.
   (C)   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the

3-14-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   (A)   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
department in the manner provided by the department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 7/02, 9-16-2002)
3-14-4: RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT:
On or before the last day of February 2003, and on or before the last day of
every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this chapter on telecommunication
retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required
by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal
telecommunications tax act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement the
act. (Ord. 7/02, 9-16-2002)
3-14-5: RESELLERS:
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax
free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active
resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 7/02, 9-16-2002)
3-14-6: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter, or the application of any provision of this
chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall
not affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that can be
given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its
application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter. (Ord. 7/02,
9-16-2002)
3-14-7: EFFECTIVE DATE:
This chapter shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and
approval and publication as required by law, provided, however, that the tax
provided for herein shall take effect for all bills issued on or after January
1, 2003. Copies of this chapter shall be certified and sent to the Illinois

representative in the discharge of his duties and the performance of this
chapter. It shall be the duty of every owner or operator to keep accurate and
complete books and records to which the City Administrator or his deputy or

to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of
said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the administrator
shall proceed in such manner as deemed best to obtain facts and information on
which to base the estimate of the tax due. As soon as the administrator shall
procure such facts and information as is obtainable upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable to any operator or
owner who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, the administrator shall proceed to determine and assess against
such operator or owner the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this
chapter. In case such determination is made, the administrator shall give a
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator or owner
so assessed at operator or owner's last known address. Such operator or owner
may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make

assessed. If application by the operator or owner for a hearing is not made
within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any,
determined by the administrator shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the administrator
shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed
herein to the operator or owner to show cause at a hearing at a time and place
fixed in said notice why said amount specified there should not be fixed for
such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing, the operator or owner may
appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and penalties
should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the administrator shall determine
the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the
person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of
such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be
payable after fifteen (15) days, unless an appeal is taken as provided in
paragraph G.

with respect to the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties, if any, may
appeal to the Mayor by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk within
fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due.
The Mayor shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City
Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator or owner at the last known
address. The findings of the Mayor shall be final and conclusive and shall be
served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice
of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable
upon the service of notice.

payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine

4-1-9: PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CODE ENFORCEMENT:
For purpose of enforcing the ICC Property Maintenance Code, the following
policy shall be employed by the City of Aledo:
   (A)   The enforcement priority is on easily verifiable exterior yard
conditions, such as weeds in excess of eight inches (8") high, inoperable cars,
accumulations of junk, etc. Such enforcement shall be on a complaint basis, but
proactive enforcement may occur for significant nuisance violations and other
areas identified by the City Council (e.g., junk cars).
   (B)   Enforcement of exterior building conditions may occur if the violation
presents a significant blighting influence, nuisance, hazard or threat to life
safety. Such matters shall be primarily complaint driven, but may be proactive
if significant violation. The Enforcement Officer shall clear such enforcement
action with his or her Supervisor. If, for some reason, the enforcement action
is undertaken by the City Administrator, he shall discuss the matter with the
Mayor prior to undertaking such enforcement.
   (C)   Enforcement of interior violations may be conducted if the owner or
occupant of the building requests an inspection and subsequent enforcement.
Interior enforcement may also be attempted if there is reasonable and
sufficient cause to believe that a significant nuisance, hazard of threat to
life safety is occurring. Reasonable cause must exist to go forward with an
interior enforcement action. An example of a reasonable cause would be a foul
odor and rats coming from a building. The Enforcement Officer shall clear
interior enforcement action with his or her Supervisor. If, for some reason,
the enforcement action is undertaken by the City Administrator, he shall
discuss the matter with the Mayor prior to undertaking such enforcement.
   (D)   The Code Officer and all inspectors shall follow the regulation
provided in the Code about entrance on private property. The Code states that
permission shall be obtained before entering private property (other than
knocking at the door or entering a public area) and before conducting an
inspection. If permission is refused, the inspector shall leave the property
and obtain instruction from his Supervisor. Under no condition shall an
inspector violate a property owner's or occupant's Fourth Amendment right
against warrantless searches or seizures.
   (E)   The emphasis on Property Maintenance Code enforcement shall be
voluntary compliance. Courtesy notices shall be issued, reasonable extensions
granted where appropriate and all reasonable effort shall be made to work with
property owners rather than against them.
   (F)   No random inspection of properties shall occur unless they are
approved under the policies enumerated above. There shall be no program of
inspections, such as commercial occupancies or rental units, unless such are
specifically authorized by the City Council and regulated by written policies
and procedures.
   (G)   The City administration may cut weeds and remove accumulations of
garbage, refuse and salvageable or unsalvageable material after proper warning
period and all voluntary compliance measures have elapsed. Work shall be billed
to the property owner and thereafter placed as a lien. All State laws and
provisions of Code shall be complied with.
   (H)   The City administration may remove inoperable vehicles from private
property as provided for by State law and local policy. (Ord. 06-19-06-1, 8-21-

weather;

and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be cleaned, abandoned, and
filled with suitable material. (Ord. 14/88, 3-20-1989)
   (G)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere
with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Director of Public
Works. (Ord. 05/2014, 4-7-2014)
7-1-13: BUILDING SEWERS, CONNECTIONS, EXTENSIONS, AND ASSOCIATED FEES:
   (A)   Application: Service shall be furnished only upon the filing of an
application with the Clerk of the City upon a form to be supplied by the City.
This application shall state the name of the applicant, the premises to be
served, the size of the service desired, and date service is desired and
include a record of service installation, inspection and approval by the City,
and a record of water meter or sewer meter reading upon commencement of service
to the applicant.
   (B)   Permit Required: No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any
connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or
appurtenances thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the Clerk
of the City.
   (C)   Types Of Permits: There shall be the following types of building sewer
permits:
      1.   For single-family residential dwelling units and commercial service;
      2.   For multi-family residential dwelling units;
      3.   For service to establishments producing industrial wastes;
      4.   For the institutional/governmental class of users;
   In any case, the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form
furnished by the City. The permit applications shall be supplemented by any
plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment
of the City.
   Any industry, as a condition of permit authorization, must provide
information describing its wastewater constituents, characteristics, and type
of activity.
   (D)   Reserve Capacity: A building sewer permit will only be issued and a
sewer connection shall only be allowed if it can be demonstrated that the
downstream sewerage facilities, including sewers, pump stations and wastewater
treatment facilities, have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately and
efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste load. (Ord. 14/88, 3-20-
1989)
   (E)   Permit And Inspection Fee: At the time of filing a building sewer
permit application, a permit and inspection fee shall be paid to the City
pursuant to title 13, "Schedule Of Fees", of this Code. (Ord. 15/2017, 6-5-
2017)
   (F)   Costs: The applicant for sewer service shall pay all costs and
expenses incidental to the installation and connection of the building sewer,
and the maintenance thereof, from the point of connection to the public sewer
of the City, or to the collector sewer of the City if located within a right-
of-way of the City, to the premises of the applicant. The owner or the person
installing the building sewer for said owner shall indemnify the City from any
loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by said
installation. (Ord. 14/88, 3-20-1989)
   (G)   Building Sewer: A separate and independent building sewer shall be
provided for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of
another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be
constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or
driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the
rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer; and except that
multi-family dwelling units, including apartments and mobile home trailer
parks, may use a single common building sewer for drainage of individual
dwelling units unless required otherwise by the City. However, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this sewerage ordinance, when in the opinion of the
City, and based upon sound engineering reasons, the City believes that it is in
the best interest of the City to permit more than one hookup to a lateral to a
sewage main owned and maintained by the City, then upon the request of any
property owner or owners or at the direction of the said City, it shall be
lawful for such property owner or owners to connect more than one building or
buildings to one sewer lateral installed by said property owners at their
expense, subject to those terms and conditions as hereinafter set forth. In
those cases where the City approves more than one building or buildings,
whether owned by one property owner or other owners to connect to one sewer
lateral, said owner or owners shall pay the sole cost of installing same unless
otherwise agreed to in writing between the City and the said owner or owners.
Furthermore, said owner or owners installing said lateral to which more than
one building is connected shall own and have the responsibility of maintaining
said sewer lateral unless the owner or owners in question agree in writing with
the City that a contrary agreement shall control and upon payment of the
application fee and monthly fee pursuant to title 13, "Schedule Of Fees", of
this Code. Also, under such circumstances, if the said sewer lateral which is
serving more than one building, whether one owner or multiple owners are
involved, breaks or malfunctions, and said owner or owners refuse to take the
necessary steps to repair same, then the City shall have the right to take
whatever action may be necessary, including the termination of water and sewage
services by terminating same at the point where said laterals may be tapped
into City mains, in order to avoid any damage or harm to the water mains and/or
sewage mains owned and maintained by the City. (Ord. 15/2017, 6-5-2017)
   (H)   Old Building Sewers: Old building sewers or any portion thereof may be
used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination
and test by the inspector, to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   (I)   Acceptable Sewer Pipe: The building sewers and/or public sewers shall
be constructed of extra strength vitrified clay sewer pipe and fittings meeting
the current ASTM "specification for extra strength clay sewer pipe", or service
weight (SV) cast iron soil pipe and fittings meeting the current ASTM
"specifications for service weight cast iron soil pipe", or ductile iron sewer
pipe and fittings meeting the current ASTM "specification for ductile iron
fittings"; or PVC sewer pipe or PVC composite sewer pipe and fittings meeting
the current ASTM "specifications for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic pipe and
fittings (minimum Schedule 40 or SDR 21)", and ASTM "specifications for PVC
composite sewer piping"; or reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) meeting the current
ASTM "specification for reinforced concrete sewer pipe". If installed in filled
or unstable ground, the building sewers and/or public sewers shall be of cast
iron soil pipe, ductile iron sewer pipe or reinforced concrete pipe, except
that vitrified clay pipe or PVC sewer pipe meeting the above specification
requirements may be accepted if laid on a suitable improved bed or cradle as
approved by the inspector.
   (J)   Joints And Connections: All joints and connections shall be made
gastight and watertight. Vitrified clay sewer pipe shall be fitted with factory
made resilient compression joints meeting the current ASTM "specification for
compression joints for vitrified clay pipe and fittings".
   Before joining the pipe in the trench, the bell and spigot surfaces shall be
wiped free of dirt or other foreign matter. A lubricant or sealer as
recommended by the pipe manufacturer shall be applied to the bell and spigot
mating surfaces just before they are joined together. The spigot end shall be
positioned into the bell end of the pipe previously laid and shall then be
shoved home to compress the joint and to assure a tight fit between the
interfaces.
   Joints for SV cast iron soil pipe shall be as described below for ductile
iron sewer pipe.
   Joints for ductile iron sewer pipe shall be "mechanical joint" or "push on
joint". To assemble a push on joint the following method is to be used unless
the manufacturer specifically recommends another method. After placing a length
of pipe in the trench, the spigot end shall be centered in the bell and the
pipe forced home and brought to correct line and grade. The pipe shall be
secured in place with approved backfill material tamped under it except at the
bells.
   To assemble a mechanical joint, the following method is to be used, unless
the manufacturer specifically recommends another method. Wash thoroughly with
soapy water the pipe socket (or bell) plain end (or spigot) and the rubber
gasket. Place gland followed by gasket over the plain end of the pipe. Insert
in socket. Push the gasket into position, making sure that it is evenly seated
in the socket of the pipe bell. Move the gland into position against the face
of the rubber gasket, insert bolts and make fingertight. Tighten bolts
alternately, that is, tighten a bottom bolt, then a top bolt and so on all
around the joint until tight.
   Joints for PVC sewer pipe shall be "elastomeric gasket joints" or "solvent
cement joints". A solvent cemented joint is one in which pipe solvent cements
into a coupling to form the joint closure. Ensure that surfaces to be jointed
are clean and dry. Liberally apply solvent to pipe end and inside of coupling.
Shove pipe home, set pipe to line and grade.
   The elastomeric gasket joint is a sliding assembly in which the lubricated
pipe spigot end slides under the rubber ring and into the bell. Make certain
the bell and rubber ring area are clean. Make sure the pipe spigot end is
clean.
   Lubricate the spigot end of the pipe. Be sure to cover the entire spigot and
circumference. Insert the spigot end into the bell so that it is in contact
with the rubber ring. Keep the pipe lengths in proper alignment. Brace the bell
while the spigot end is pushed in under the rubber ring, so that previously
completed joints will not be closed up. Push the spigot into the bell until the
reference mark on the pipe barrel is flush with the end of the bell.
   Joints for RCP sewer shall be "rubber gasket joint" construction.
Immediately before making joint, lubricate entire gasket and inside of bell of
last pipe and spigot end of pipe with an approved vegetable lubricant. Take
care that gasket and ends of pipe are clean and free of sand or gravel.
Introduce spigot of pipe being laid with gasket in place, into bell end of
previously laid pipe. Set pipe to line and grade and then jack or push
completely home.
   (K)   The size and slope of building sewers shall be subject to the approval
of the inspector, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches
(4"). The slope of such four inch (4") pipe shall not be less than one-eighth
inch (1/8") per foot. A slope of one-fourth inch (1/4") per foot shall be used
wherever practical.
   (L)   Whenever possible the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to or within three feet (3') of any bearing wall, which might thereby
weaken. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment in so
far as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved
pipe and fittings.
   (M)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer. No
water operated sewage ejector shall be used.
   (N)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the inspector. Pipe
laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with current ASTM
specification designation C-12 except that no backfill shall be placed until
the work has been inspected by the inspector or his representative.
   (O)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or ground
water to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly
or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
   (P)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the "Y" or "T" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable
location. If no branch is available on sewers twelve inches (12") in diameter
or less, a connection may be made, at the owner's expense, using a manufactured
saddle type connection at the location and of the type specified by the
inspector. Where the public sewer is greater than twelve inches (12") in
diameter, and no properly located "Y" or "T" branch is available, a neat hole
may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in
the downstream direction at an angle of about forty five degrees (45°). A forty
five degree (45°) ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end
cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. Under no
circumstances will the sewer service protrude into the sewer main to which the
connection is made. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection
shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public
sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and
watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the
connection only when approved by the inspector. Manholes shall be constructed
at any junction of an eight inch (8") diameter line or larger into a public
sewer.
   (Q)   The applicant for the building sewer shall notify the inspector when
the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer.
The connection shall be made under the supervision of the inspector or his
representative.
   (R)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of such work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
   (S)   The city shall be responsible for determining whether or not an
extension of a public sewer is economically feasible based on the estimated
cost of the extension and the number of existing potential users that will use
said sewer line. If the extension is economically feasible, then the city may
install and pay the cost of the extension at the discretion of the city. If the
city elects not to pay the costs of extending the public sewer, then the person
or persons desiring sewer service shall install the extension at their own
personal expense upon written consent of the city. The city shall not pay for
any extensions to an undeveloped area, such as a subdivision being developed,
unless there are sufficient existing residents or businesses to make the
extension economically feasible.
   (T)   Sewer Expansion And Extension Connection Fee: The sewer expansion and
extension connection fee is hereby established to reimburse the city for its
costs in extending sewer lines to serve new and additional users and to
increase its capacity to transport and treat sewage. Such fee shall be based
upon the pro rata share of the cost of said exploration, construction and
extension which cost was required to provide the sewer services being made
available to the new or additional user. The sewer expansion and extension
connection fee shall be based upon all such costs including, but not limited
to, engineering fees, supervision, legal fees, land costs and construction.
   When a new or additional user of the system wishes to connect into the
sewerage system of the city, he shall request from the director an estimate of
the sum of the sewer expansion and extension connection fee attributable to the
property which he wishes to serve with the municipal sewerage system. Within
ten (10) days after such application, the director shall certify to such
applicant the then current amount of the sewer expansion and extension
connection fee attributable to the property sought to be served. In arriving at
the sewer expansion and extension connection fee, the director may request such
information from the applicant and shall be reasonably necessary in order that
he may compute the amount of the fee. He shall, for example, be allowed to
inquire as to the use which the applicant desires to make of the land. Any
sewer expansion and extension connection fee so certified by the city shall
remain in effect for a period of sixty (60) days and may, at the option of the
city, be further extended. After such sixty (60) day period, if the connection
fee has not been paid, the city may recompute the amount of such connection
fee. In arriving at a recomputed figure, the director shall consider any
additional costs incurred by the city in providing the sewer services desired
by the applicant. If an applicant should disagree with or dispute the amount of
the sewer expansion and extension connection fee, in whole or in part, as
determined by the director, he shall be allowed to appeal such decision to the
city. The city shall allow the applicant to appear before it, either at a
regular or special city council meeting or otherwise, to present his objections
to the estimate of costs. The city may require the director to appear before it
to explain the manner in which said connection fee has been computed. The
decision of the city regarding this matter shall be final.
   (U)   The city must approve all plans and specifications for any extensions.
Before any extensions are installed, the plans and specifications must be
reviewed and approved by the state of Illinois environmental protection agency.
   (V)   Ownership rights of way, and title must be conveyed to the city for
all extensions installed by anyone other than the city. The city shall maintain
the extended public sewers thereafter.
   (W)   No extension of the public sewer will be permitted if, in the opinion
of the city, the system does not have the necessary capacity to serve the
proposed extension. (Ord. 14/88, 3-20-1989)
7-1-14: USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS:
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit, or permit to be
deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within the
jurisdiction of the city any wastewater or other polluted water except where
suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with provisions of this
chapter and the NPDES permit. All disposal by any person into the sewer system
is unlawful except those discharges in compliance with federal standards
promulgated pursuant to the federal act and more stringent state and local
standards.
   (B)   Users of the treatment works shall immediately notify the city as to
unlawful flows or wastes that are discharged accidentally or otherwise to the

   (F)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the
opinion of the city that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage
treatment process, or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream; or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a
nuisance. In forming its opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
city will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject
wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of
the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant, and the maximum limits established by regulatory agencies. The

   (G)   If any waters are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in subsections (E) and (F) of this section, and/or
which are in violation of the standard for pretreatment provided in chapter 1,
EPA rules and regulations, subchapter D, water programs part 128 - pretreatment
standards, federal register volume 38, no. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973, and
any amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the city may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the city may:
      1.   Reject the wastes;
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      4.   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions
of subsection (P) of this section.
If the city permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design
and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the city, and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances and laws.
   (H)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or
other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required
for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the city, and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperatures. They shall
be of substantial construction, watertight, and equipped with easily removable

parts per million by weight, or 2) containing more than two hundred fifty (250)
parts per million by weight of suspended solids, or 3) containing any quantity
of substances having the characteristics described in subsections (E) and (F)
of this section, or 4) having an average daily flow greater than two percent
(2%) of the average daily sewage flow of the city, shall be subject to the
review and approval of the director. Where necessary in the opinion of the
director, the owner shall provide, at his expense such preliminary treatment as
may be necessary to: 1) reduce the biochemical oxygen demand to two hundred
(200) parts per million and the suspended solids to two hundred fifty (250)
parts per million by weight, or 2) reduce objectionable characteristics or
constituents to within the maximum limits provided for in subsections (E) and
(F) of this section, or 3) control the quantities and rates of discharge of
such waters or wastes. Plans, specifications, and any other pertinent
information relating to proposed preliminary treatment facilities shall be
submitted for the approval of the director and of the environmental protection
agency of the state of Illinois, and no construction of such facilities shall
be commenced until said approvals are obtained in writing.
   (K)   Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his expense.
   (L)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together
with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to
facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole,
when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed
in accordance with plans approved by the city. The manhole shall be installed
by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained and operated by him so as
to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (M)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the city or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge.
   (N)   The number, type, and frequency of laboratory analysis to be performed
by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city, but no less than once per year
the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the
wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state and
local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analysis to the city at such times and in such
manner as prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analysis, and reporting required by the city. At such times as
deemed necessary, the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples
for analyses by an outside laboratory service.
   (O)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods For The Examination Of
Water And Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards of life, limb, and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from a twenty four (24) hour composite of all outfalls, whereas
pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.
   (P)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the
industrial concern, provided such payments are in accordance with the federal
state guidelines for user charge system and industrial cost recovery system,
and provisions of section
7-1-15 of this chapter. (Ord. 14/88, 3-20-1989)
   (Q)   Any persons violating the provisions of this section shall be subject
to a penalty pursuant to title 12, "Schedule Of Fines", of this code. Each day
that such violation continues shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
(Ord. 23/2016, 1-3-2017)
7-1-15: WASTEWATER CHARGES:
   (A)   Basis For Wastewater Charges: The wastewater charge for the use of and
for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of
a service charge, a capital improvement charge, a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance plus replacement, and a surcharge, if applicable.
   The service charge shall not be less than that computed by dividing the
annual debt service costs, including minimum required depreciation and reserve
accounts, by the total number of users. Through further divisions, the
quarterly minimum required service charge can be computed.
   The capital improvement charge shall be based on a quarterly charge to each
customer of the system to apply toward future capital improvement projects.
   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water
meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
concentrations:
      1.   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
      2.   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred fifty milligrams per
liter (250 mg/l)
It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall
not be less than that computed as follows:
      1.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including replacement of selected
equipment, for all work categories.
      2.   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by
volume, suspended solids and BOD, if possible.
      3.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated.
      4.   Proportion the estimated costs to customer classes by volume,
suspended solids and BOD.
      5.   Compute costs per one hundred (100) cubic feet for normal sewage
strength.
      6.   Compute surcharge costs per one hundred (100) cubic feet per
milligrams per liter in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal
concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge will be
based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all
wastes which exceed the two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) and two
hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) concentration for BOD and SS,
respectively. Subsection (F) of this section specifies the procedure to compute
a surcharge.
   The service charge, the capital improvement charge, the basic user charge,
and the surcharge are all computed as shown on the attached "Engineering Data"
sheets, which are hereby made a part of this chapter.
   The adequacy of the wastewater charges shall be reviewed annually by
certified public accountants for the city in their annual audit report. The
wastewater charges shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in service
costs, in operation and maintenance costs, including replacement costs, or in
administrative and reserve costs.
   (B)   Measurement Of Flow: The volume of flow used for computing basic user
charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the
nearest whole cubic foot.
      1.   If the person discharging waters into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the city waterworks system,
all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall
install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the
city for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these
other sources.
      2.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the city if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
      3.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the city.
   (C)   Minimum User Charge: There shall be and there is hereby established a
minimum user charge (including a service charge and a basic user charge) for
the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city. A
minimum user charge of twenty eight dollars fifty cents ($28.50) per quarter
shall be applied to all users whose water consumption does not exceed five
hundred (500) cubic feet per quarter. The minimum user charge consists of
twenty three dollars seventy five cents ($23.75) for the service charge, three
dollars ($3.00) for the capital improvement charge, and one dollar seventy five
cents ($1.75) for operation, maintenance and replacement for the first five
hundred (500) cubic feet. A basic user rate of thirty five cents ($0.35) per
one hundred (100) cubic feet shall be applied to all users for water
consumption over five hundred (500) cubic feet per quarter.
   (D)   Flat Rate Charge: All nonmetered residential users of the wastewater
facilities shall pay a minimum flat rate charge consisting of twenty three
dollars seventy five cents ($23.75) per quarter to cover the costs of the
service charge, three dollars ($3.00) for the capital improvement charge, and
the basic user charge of thirty five cents ($0.35) per one hundred (100) cubic
feet. The flat rate charge will allow a maximum of two thousand five hundred
(2,500) cubic feet per quarter; and is hereby established to be thirty five
dollars fifty cents ($35.50) per quarter. In the event the twelve (12) month
average use of the wastewater facilities is determined by the city to be in
excess of two thousand five hundred (2,500) cubic feet per quarter, the city
may require such flat rate user to install metering devices on the water supply
or sewer main to measure the amount of service supplied.
   (E)   Surcharge Rate: The rates or surcharges for BOD and SS shall be as
follows:
      1.   For BOD, a surcharge rate of $0.0754 per pound shall be applied for
a waste strength in excess of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
      2.   For SS, a surcharge rate of $0.0430 per pound shall be applied for a
waste strength in excess of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l).
   (F)   Computing Of Surcharge: The concentration of wastes used for computing
surcharges shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be
performed as often as may be deemed necessary by the city and shall be binding
as a basis for surcharges. The surcharge shall be the sum of subsections (F)1
and (F)2 of this section computed as follows:
      1.   For BOD, multiply the surcharge rate by 8.34 (conversion factor for
number of pounds per gallon) multiplied by .0007481 million gallons (100 cubic
feet = 748.1 gallons). This number is then multiplied by the concentration
amount above the allowable two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l),
multiplied by the number of one hundred (100) cubic foot units contributed for
the day. This yields a surcharge per day for BOD (in cost per 100 cubic feet
per milligrams per liter in excess).
      2.   For suspended solids, multiply the surcharge rate by 8.34
(conversion factor for number of pounds per gallons) multiplied by .0007481
million gallons (100 cubic feet = 748.1 gallons). This number is then
multiplied by the concentration amount above the allowable two hundred fifty
milligrams per liter (250 mg/l), multiplied by the number of one hundred (100)
cubic foot units contributed for the day. This yields a surcharge per day for
suspended solids (in cost per 100 cubic feet per milligrams per liter in
excess).
   (G)   Computation Of Wastewater Charge: The wastewater charge shall be
computed by the following formula:
      W = SC + CIC + (V times BUR) + S
   Where:
 
W   = Amount of wastewater charged ($) per billing period
SC  = Service charge (subsection (A))
CIC = Capital improvement charge (subsection (A))
V   = Wastewater volume for the billing period
BUR = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement (subsection
      (C))
S   = Amount of surcharge (subsections (E) and (F))
 
(Ord. 14/88, 3-20-1989)
7-1-16: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   (A)   Bills: Said rates or charges for service shall be payable quarterly.
The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service
shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the service to such premises
and the service is furnished to the premises by the city only upon the
condition that the owner of the premises, occupant and user of the services are
jointly and severally liable therefor to the city. Bills for sewer service
shall be sent out by the city clerk on the first day of the month succeeding
the period for which the service is billed.
   (B)   Nonresidential Use: When sewage treatment service is made available to
nonresident users, the rates therefor shall be based on the formula as set
forth in section
7-1-15 of this chapter multiplied by 1.5.
   (C)   Delinquent Bills: If the charges for such services are not paid within
thirty (30) days after the rendition of the bill for such services, such
services shall be considered delinquent and a notice of such effect shall be
mailed by the city clerk to the owner, occupant and/or user of such premises.
   (D)   Lien Notice Of Delinquency And Termination Of Service: Whenever a bill
for sewer service remains delinquent for ten (10) days for quarterly service,
the city clerk shall cause services to be discontinued without further notice
and such services shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled. The
city clerk may file with the county recorder of deeds a statement of lien
claim. This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises
served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the city claims a lien
for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to the period covered by
the bill.
   The failure of the city clerk to record such lien or to mail such notice or
the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to
foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned in the foregoing item.
   (E)   Foreclosure Of Lien: Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges
shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be
applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the
foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill-in-equity in
the name of the city. The city attorney may, upon authorization of the city
council, institute such proceedings in the name of the city in any court having
jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill has
remained unpaid for ninety (90) days, after it has been rendered.
   (F)   Revenues: All revenues and monies derived from the operation of the
sewerage system shall be deposited in the water and sewer fund of the city. All
such revenues and monies shall be held by the city treasurer separate and apart

and all of said sum, without any deductions whatever, shall be delivered to the
city treasurer not more than ten (10) days after receipt of the same, or at
such more frequent intervals as may from time to time be directed by the city.
Said treasurer shall administer such fund in every respect in the manner
provided by statute of the "revised cities and villages act", effective January
1942.
   The revenue received by the city from the sewer permit and inspection fee
and the sewer expansion and extension connection fee shall be used by the city
for its sewer purposes, with primary application thereof being made to the
necessary expansion of the works of the sewer system to meet the requirements
of new or additional users thereof. Such funds shall be placed, until they are
used, into a fund which is designated as the "water and sewer fund".
   (G)   Accounts: The city treasurer shall establish a proper system of
accounts and shall keep proper books, records, and accounts in which complete
and correct entries shall be made of all transactions relative to the sewer
system, and at regular annual intervals, he shall cause to be made an audit by
an independent auditing concern of the books to show the receipts and
disbursements of the sewer system.
The financial information to be shown in the audit report shall include the
following:
      1.   Flow data showing total gallons received at the wastewater plant for
the current fiscal year.
      2.   Billing data to show total number of gallons billed.

shall be supplied by the City upon application therefor in writing by the owner
of said property and payment with said application of the installation fee
pursuant to title 13, "Schedule Of Fees", of this Code. Such application and
payment shall be made to the Clerk who shall notify the Superintendent thereof.
Such application shall specify with reasonable certainty the location of the
premises where such additional meter or meters is or are to be installed. (Ord.
16/2017, 6-5-2017)
   (B)   Installation Of Additional Meters: Any additional meter installed in
or on any premises in the City shall be placed as close to the existing meter
connections as possible, or if there is an initial multiple installation of
meters, then all shall be installed as close together as is reasonably
possible. If there shall be more than one water meter on any premises each
shall be connected so as to be entirely separated from any other water meter so
that each meter will accurately meter the water used in connection with the
particular part of the premises for which the meter is installed and so that
the charges for use of water may be computed for each particular meter through
which water passes. In all cases where more than one water meter shall be in
use or on any premises in the City each shall be read separately and charges
for the same made to the user thereof, but it is not intended that this section
shall in any way conflict with any existing provisions.
   (C)   Material And Labor: The City shall not be required to furnish any
material or labor for piping water to the place where any meter, or additional
meter if more than one, is to be installed, but the "installation" as above
provided for, shall include only the services actually necessary to connect
said meter under the supervision of the Water Superintendent after the pipes to
lead into and out of said meter are in place. (Ord. 6/40, 3-17-1941)
   (D)   Meter Testing: Any consumer may request the City to make a test of the
accuracy of the water meter then in use on their premises. Prior to conducting
the test the consumer shall be required to deposit with the City a fee pursuant
to title 13, "Schedule Of Fees", of this Code for a residential meter testing
conducted by the City, or in the event that an independent test is requested or
required, the deposit shall be the amount necessary to cover all expenses
associated therewith.
   In the event such meter is found by testing to register incorrectly by more
than one hundred five percent (105%) capacity then another accurate meter shall
be substituted and the test deposit shall be refunded. Past water bills shall
be adjusted by refund or credit of such percentage in excess of one hundred
percent (100%) capacity of the amount of the water bills for a period of not
more than two (2) months previous to such test.
   In the event that the meter is found to be registering at an error of one
hundred five percent (105%) capacity or less the consumer shall forfeit the
test deposit and such funds shall be deposited in the water operating funds of
the City.
   (E)   Meter Deposit Application: In those cases where the applicant
requesting service is a tenant, contract purchaser, or a trustee of an Illinois
land trust, the applicant shall also be required to state the capacity in which
he makes application for such service as a condition of approval of the
application, and in those cases, the landlord, contract seller or each
beneficiary of the land trustee, depending upon whatever the case may be, must
also sign the City's meter deposit application form, indicating not only the
capacity in which he signs such form, but also his correct legal mailing
address, including zip code. The City's meter deposit application form shall
state that the owner or occupant of any service is jointly or severally liable
to pay for all utilities furnished to the premises, and in the event any bill
is not paid within thirty (30) days after its rendition, the delinquent bill
shall constitute a lien against the premises. In addition to the meter deposit
application form, each applicant who is a tenant, contract purchaser or a
trustee of an Illinois land trust for the premises for which the application is
made shall be required to accompany his application with a deposit pursuant to
title 13, "Schedule Of Fees", of this Code, to be known as a meter deposit fee,
and the deposit proceeds may be used to pay delinquent gas, water and sewer or
service charges or refunded as provided below.
   The meter deposit charge shall be deposited in the Meter Deposit Fund and in
the event any customer discontinues service and has paid in full all amounts
due for gas, water and sewer and service charges, then the full amount of the
deposit shall be refunded. However, in the event that any amounts are due from
said customer, either for gas, water and sewer or service charges, then such
amounts shall be deducted and paid into the proper fund and the balance shall
be refunded.
   Any tenant, contract purchaser or trustee of an Illinois land trust who has
paid a deposit and later becomes the owner of record of the property served
shall, upon application to the City, be refunded his deposit. (Ord. 16/2017, 6-
5-2017)
8-6-8: WATER AND SEWER RATES 1 :

collection and sewage treatment shall be classified into two (2) general
categories for rate making purposes. The two (2) general categories shall be
entitled "restricted funds" and "operation, maintenance and replacement". The
anticipated costs for each of these categories shall be annually projected by
the City in order to calculate the rates required to recover budget costs for
each year. Also, the City shall determine the number of water customers from
the preceding fiscal year and the amount of billable flow attributed to all
customers in one hundred (100) cubic feet of units averaged over the preceding
five (5) fiscal years.
      The number of water customers and the billable flow for all customers
shall be obtained from the City Clerk's billing records for the preceding
fiscal year.
      The "restricted funds" category referred to herein shall include those
costs which are mandated by bond ordinance presently and in the future which
must be collected and paid each year that any bond issue or portion thereof
remains outstanding. Each outstanding bond issue may have up to five (5) cost
components being commonly designated "operation and maintenance account"; "bond
and interest account"; "bond and interest reserve account"; "depreciation
account"; and "surplus account". The term "restricted funds" shall also include
all other forms of indebtedness for the payment of all capital expenditures
incurred in connection with the water system.
      Notwithstanding the above definition of "restricted funds", the amount of
restricted funds computed under the above definition shall be reduced for the
sewer portion thereof as follows for the first two (2) fiscal years:
 
Fiscal Year                       Amount
Fiscal year ending April 30, 1993 $30,000.00
Fiscal year ending April 30, 1994 15,000.00

shall include those costs required to operate, maintain, upgrade and replace
equipment used in the waterworks and sewerage system on an annual basis,
including pumping, distribution, sewerage collection, capital improvements and
administration. In addition, in each of the respective fiscal years designated
above, the foregoing category shall also include the lump sum specified above
for each such fiscal year in question for the sewer portion thereof.
      3.   Procedure For Computing Monthly Billings: Upon approval of the
annual Water and Sewer Fund budget, line item budget entries described therein
shall be applied to allocations set forth below:
         (a)   Service Charge: To determine the monthly service charge:
            (1)   Determine the total number of water and sewer customers
served on the last day of the preceding fiscal year from reports in the Office
of the City Clerk.
            (2)   Divide the total budgeted costs for restricted funds for the
coming fiscal year by the total number of water and sewer customers determined
under subsection (A)3(a)(1) of this section to compute the annual customer
water and sewer service costs.
            (3)   Divide the annual customer service costs by twelve (12)
months to determine the monthly customer service charge.
         (b)   Basic User Rate: To determine the basic user rate charge:
            (1)   Determine the average total one hundred (100) cubic feet of
units billed over the last preceding five (5) fiscal years.
            (2)   Divide the total budgeted costs for operation, maintenance,
and replacement by the total units of one hundred (100) cubic feet of units
billed determined under subsection (A)3(b)(1) of this section.
         (c)   Charges To Customers:
            (1)   Minimum Charges: Water and sewer customers consuming one
hundred (100) cubic feet of metered water or less per month shall be charged
the sum of the service charge plus the product of multiplying the base user
rate times the constant unit of one hundred (100) cubic feet of water consumed
for such customers.
            (2)   For Customers With Monthly Consumption Above One Hundred
Cubic Feet: Water and sewer customers whose monthly water metered consumption
is more than one hundred (100) cubic feet shall be charged the sum of the
service charge plus the product of multiplying the base user rate times the
number of one hundred (100) cubic feet of units consumed.
      4.   Water And Sewer Charge Computation Booklet: There shall be kept on
file in the Office of the City Clerk a "Water and Sewer Charge Computation
Booklet for the City of Aledo, Illinois", showing the water and sewer charge
computations which will be billed to customers as applied through the formula

   (B)   Meter Deposit Application: In those cases where the applicant
requesting service is a tenant, contract purchaser, or a trustee of an Illinois
land trust, the applicant shall also be required to state the capacity in which
he makes application for such service as a condition of approval of the
application, and in those cases, the landlord, contract seller or each
beneficiary of the land trustee, depending upon whatever the case may be, must
also sign the City's meter deposit application form, indicating not only the
capacity in which he signs such form, but also his correct legal mailing
address, including zip code. The City's meter deposit application form shall
state that the owner or occupant of any service is jointly or severally liable
to pay for all utilities furnished to the premises, and in the event any bill
is not paid within thirty (30) days after its rendition, the delinquent bill
shall constitute a lien against the premises. The City Clerk may record a
notice of lien in the Office of the Mercer County Recorder of Deeds in the
event the outstanding balance on any account that is delinquent by more than
thirty (30) days exceeds two hundred dollars ($200.00), and the City Clerk
shall record a notice of lien in the Office of the Mercer County Recorder of
Deeds in the event the outstanding balance on any account that is delinquent by
more than thirty (30) days exceeds three (3) times the monthly average gas bill
for such account over the preceding twelve (12) month period. In addition to
the meter deposit application form, each applicant who is a tenant, contract
purchaser or a trustee of an Illinois land trust for the premises for which the
application is made shall be required to accompany his application with a
deposit pursuant to title 13, "Schedule Of Fees", of this Code to be known as a
meter deposit fee and the deposit proceeds may be used to pay delinquent gas,
water and sewer or service charges or refunded as provided below.

All gas customers shall be liable for the gas consumption as shown by the
meter. Waste, leakage or other causes not the liability of the City shall be
included under said liability. The meter reading shall be conclusive provided
that whenever the City shall find any meter not registering, then an average
bill may be rendered based at the option of the City, on either the nearest
previous three (3) months' average use, when meter was in good order, or based
on the same month or months of the preceding year. Whenever the City shall have
reason to believe that the meter is not registering correctly, then an average
bill as stated above may be rendered and the meter removed for testing. If such
average bill should prove to be incorrectly estimated, either by actual
testing, or by actual gas consumption, after being replaced by a corrected
meter, then such bill shall be compared to the same. (Ord. 10/67, 2-5-1968;
amd. Ord. 6/72, 12-4-1972, eff. 1-1-1973; Ord. 6/74, 8-1-1974)
8-13-7: TEST OF METERS:
Any consumer may request the City to make a test of the accuracy of the meter
then in use on their premises. Prior to conducting the test the consumer shall
be required to deposit with the City a fee pursuant to title 13, "Schedule Of
Fees", of this Code for a residential meter testing conducted by the City. In
the event that an independent test is requested or required, the deposit shall
be the amount necessary to cover all expenses associated therewith.
In the event such meter is found by testing to register incorrectly at full
capacity by more than two percent (2%) then another accurate meter shall be
substituted and the test deposit shall be refunded. Past gas bills shall be
adjusted by refund or credit of such percentage of the amount of the gas bills
for a period of not more than two (2) months previous to such test.
In the event that the meter is found to be registering at two percent (2%) or
less error the consumer shall forfeit the test deposit and such funds shall be
deposited in the gas operating funds of the City. (Ord. 16/2017, 6-5-2017)

8-13-11: GAS RATE SCHEDULE:
All natural gas furnished to any City gas customer shall be subject to a
combination of variable and flat rates. Each gas customer shall pay a meter/
facility fee in the fixed amount of $14.00 per month per meter. Gas rates shall
be based upon a fixed distribution charge of $2.50 per 1,000 cubic feet (or
part thereof) used by each customer, plus 102% of the actual cost incurred by
the city for its purchase of gas, as set forth in title 13, "Schedule Of Fees",
of this Code. Non-residents of the City will be billed a twice the rate of
residents; provided however, that natural gas furnished to a customer for use
on land that is: a) used for farming purposes, b) comprised of ten (10) acres
or more, and c) located outside of the corporate limits of the City shall be
charged the gas rate determined by the City for resident customers. In the
event that such farmland subsequently is subdivided to be comprised of less
than ten (10) acres, the gas rate for non-resident customers shall be
applicable.
The natural gas rate shall be effective with the consumption beginning with
meter readings for January 2020 gas usage, to be billed in February 2020, and
shall continue from month to month until such time that the Corporate
Authorities deem it appropriate to amend the rates by ordinance.
If any statement for natural gas service is not paid by the fifth day of the
month following its date of rendition, the account shall be considered
delinquent and a service charge of three percent (3%) for each month or
fraction of a month shall be assessed on the outstanding amount due at the
close of the fifth day of the month following the month during which the
statement in question was rendered, excluding any service charges previously
assessed thereon.
Any consumer refusing or neglecting to pay his statement for a period of thirty
(30) days subsequent to its rendition shall be deprived of the use of gas and
the City shall stop all gas supply to such consumer until such time that all
past due statements are paid including all penalty charges.
Accounts that remain delinquent for more than sixty (60) days, shall incur an
additional twenty-five dollar ($25.00) administrative service fee one the
sixty-first (61st) day following the rendition of the bill for service. (Ord.

chapter. Where such service is discontinued and the gas is shut off or stopped,
whether by the City or at the request of the property owner, the gas shall not
again be turned on or supplied to such premises until all such delinquent
charges due the City have been paid and there is no existing default or
violation of any of the provisions of the several sections of this chapter. A
written application shall be filed with the Clerk for the renewal of such
service, which application shall be accompanied by a fee pursuant to title 13,
"Schedule Of Fees", of this Code to pay for the shutting off and turning on of
the gas service. No customer shall be permitted to use the stopcock of the
service connection for shutting off gas while making extensions, additions, or
repairs to the pipe or equipment on the premises. Such shutoff or
discontinuance or interruption of service will be made only by the City or its
properly authorized employees. (Ord. 16/2017, 6-5-2017)

reason. In all cases, where possible, a reasonable notice of the circumstances
will be given to the customers, but in an emergency the gas may be shut off
without notice. Such necessary repairs or work will be made by the City as
rapidly as may be practical. The City shall not be held responsible or liable
because of any shutoff or discontinuance of service for any direct or resultant
damages to any person, company or customer.
In the event of such discontinuance of gas service, the city will make every
attempt to safeguard the customer and service shall not be renewed until the
city authorities have purged the lines and put into service all automatic
controls and pilots. The cost of purging of lines, relighting pilots, and
checking automatic controls will be borne by the city and the customer will not
be liable for any portion thereof. Where the nature of the customer's
operations are such that an interruption of service might create a hazard or
large economic loss, such customer shall provide facilities for standby service
if desired.
Whenever mains, pipes, service connections or other facilities of the gas
system are taken up, shut off or interfered with by reasons of any city street
improvement, the city will endeavor to maintain service so far as is reasonably
possible, but will not be directly or indirectly liable for any interruption,
poor pressure or damage of any kind either to the customers adjacent or to
other customers affected thereby. Direct damage to property due to such
operations shall be either repaired or replaced by the city without cost to the
customer.

of such size as would be approved by the American Gas Association for natural
gas appliances having the same BTU input rating.
From the house pipe manifold any appliance pipe may be extended a maximum
distance of forty (40) linear feet. For each ninety degree (90°) turn in the
appliance pipe three (3) linear feet shall be deducted from the maximum
distance. Copper pipe may be substituted for iron pipe from the manifold to the
appliance. Copper pipe must have OD dimension equivalent to ID of standard iron
pipe. Only type K copper pipe may be used. All copper fittings must be of flare
type only. When copper tubing is used, insulated copper to iron fittings must
be used at the meter end and appliance end of the tubing.
No connection will be made with any house type manifold that has not been
tested for leakage.
All gas conversion burners to be installed,shall be AGA approved. All designed
heating plants shall be AGA approved and the manufacturer's recommendations for
the installation shall be followed.
No conversion burner shall be installed in an old or inefficient warm air
furnace which is in poor repair or in an old or leaky boiler which is in poor
repair. Test for leakage shall be with oil of wintergreen or smoke bomb on any
warm air heating plant before installing a conversion burner. Furnaces must be
reset if found to be leaking.
Before connecting a flue or vent connector into any chimney, the chimney shall
be examined to ascertain that it is properly constructed, clear, clean and will
freely conduct the products of combustion from the gas heating appliance in
question to the outer air.
All appliances, excepting cook stoves, with over eight thousand (8,000) BTU per
hour input rating must be vented. No unvented appliance excepting cook stoves,
shall be placed in the same room with a gas refrigerator. An approved type vent

All the rules and regulations concerning the natural gas system of the city and
the consumption of gas therefrom shall become a part of the contract with every
gas customer, and every gas customer shall be subject thereto and bound
thereby. (Ord. 4/56, 3-4-1957)
8-13-17: EXTENSIONS:
The city shall not be required to extend mains and service within the city
limits, a distance of more than one hundred feet (100') per customer and only
then when sufficient funds are available in excess of those required for the
proper operation of the system. Extension of mains and service outside of the
city limits shall be subject to approval of the council and shall be also
subject to all of the rules and regulations and provisions as provided herein
or as may be amended. (Ord. 4/56, 3-4-1957; amd. Ord. 9/74, 12-2-1974)
Where service is desired when funds for extensions are not available or/and
when the distance is in excess of the one hundred feet (100') per customer
noted above, such extension can be made if the applicant will deposit with the
city the estimated cost of making the extension, less one hundred feet (100')
when funds are available, or the entire amount when funds are not available.
The amounts so deposited shall be refunded to such consumer or consumers at the
rate of fifty percent (50%) of each monthly billing until the total deposited
has been refunded. Such deposit shall be interest free. In the event that the
amount deposited is greater or less than the actual cost of the extension, such
excess or deficiency shall be corrected prior to giving service.
Deposits made under the provisions of this section shall not exempt the
applicant from the payment of all other charges required by this chapter.
Amounts received by the city for such extensions shall be deposited in the

8-13-20: BUDGET BILLING OF NATURAL GAS:
Notwithstanding the billing procedures for natural gas based on actual usage
set forth in section
8-13-11 of this chapter, customers of the natural gas utility operated by the
city of Aledo shall have the right to elect budget billing of natural gas,
which will equalize each monthly bill for said gas usage as nearly as is
possible under the circumstances, provided that said budget billing shall be
offered by the city to all its customers upon the terms and conditions as
hereinafter set forth:
   (A)   Each customer electing the benefits of budget billing shall execute a
written contract incorporating all the terms and conditions for budget billing
as set forth in the ordinance codified herein. In the event there is more than
one owner or occupant of the premises on which budget billing is elected, then
all owners or all tenants of the premises in question must execute the written
contract required in this section before the benefits of budget billing shall
be made available to anyone requesting said billing method for natural gas.
   (B)   Each customer electing budget billing shall indicate to the city clerk
whether a fiscal budget year beginning May 1 or June 1 is desired, which
election once made is binding upon the customer for that respective fiscal
budget year. The city clerk shall have the right to assume that the customer
desires the same fiscal budget year for all subsequent periods during which
budget billing is in effect unless the customer notifies the city clerk in
writing thirty five (35) days before the last day of the then current fiscal
budget year in question that a new fiscal budget year as defined herein is
desired by the customer.
   (C)   Subject to the right of the city to adjust the monthly budget bill as
provided in subsection (G) of this section, the city clerk and the director of
public works and utilities shall cooperate in computing the monthly budget bill
for the customer and shall use the following formula in computing the monthly
budget bill: 1) the actual use of natural gas by the premises in question for
the most recent eleven (11) consecutive billing periods prior to the first day
of the fiscal budget year in question for said customer shall be totaled and
then divided by eleven (11); 2) the then current gas rate for natural gas for
said type of customer as of the first day of the fiscal budget year in question
for said customer shall be multiplied by one hundred ten percent (110%); and 3)
the quotient computed in part 1) of this subsection shall be multiplied by the
product computed in part 2) of this subsection, which product shall be equal to
the monthly budget bill.
   Subject to the provisions of subsection (G) of this section, the customer
will be billed in eleven (11) equal monthly installments, said billing period
to begin on May 1 or June 1 of the fiscal budget year in question, with the
first budget bill to be rendered during June or July of the fiscal budget year
in question, said month depending upon the fiscal budget year last elected by
the customer. In the month of April or May, following, depending upon whatever
the case may be, the customer will be billed for actual gas used in that
billing period plus any amount necessary to bring total payments in balance
with the total use for the twelve (12) month period ending on the last day of
the last regular billing period for the fiscal budget year in question for said
customer. If the customer's total payments exceed the total gas usage, a refund
will be made by the city within a reasonable time, but not to exceed forty five
(45) days after the last day of the particular fiscal budget year last elected
by the customer.
   (D)   Each monthly budget statement will show the consumption of natural gas
for the billing period, the cost thereof, the budget balance existing on the
last day of the billing period, and the amount of the normal monthly budget
payment due.
   (E)   All budget statements not paid by the fifth day of the month following
the month of rendition of such statement are subject to an additional ten
percent (10%) charge on the amount of the monthly budget bill to cover the cost
of administration and if not paid within thirty (30) days from the date of
rendition, the account shall be considered delinquent on said date with the
following consequences:
      1.   The privilege of budget billing for said customer shall be
immediately revoked;
      2.   The customer shall not have the right to elect again budget billing
for the fiscal year in question;
      3.   The city shall have the right to terminate its gas service to the
customer as soon as the customer's credit balance, if any, for purchases of
natural gas has been depleted; and
      4.   If the customer owes the city for natural gas purchased, the city
may institute suit against the customer for the delinquent amount owed,
including penalty charges, plus an assessment of reasonable attorney fees
incurred by the city in instituting said suit and postjudgment proceedings, if
necessary.
   (F)   Anyone desiring to elect the benefit of budget billing must meet the
following requirements:
   The premises using the city's natural gas service must have been hooked up
to the city's natural gas system for at least eleven (11) consecutive months
prior to the beginning of the fiscal budget year selected by the customer for
budget billing.
   In addition, budget billing shall be available only to a customer who
executes an agreement and begins making the agreed monthly budget payments in
June or July as provided in said agreement, except a customer who executes an
agreement after the beginning of his selected fiscal budget year may still
elect the benefits of budget billing upon condition that the customer pays, if
necessary, in one lump sum, a sufficient amount so that the customer shall have
paid to the city the sum of all monthly budget bills due beginning with the
first month of the fiscal year selected through the end of the month during
which the agreement was executed. Failure by the customer to make said lump sum
payment, if required, on or before the fifth day of the month following the
month of rendition of a statement for said amount, shall result in the customer
being subject to those provisions set forth in subsection (E) of this section.
   (G)   There are many factors that affect the cost and usage of natural gas
supplied to any particular premises, including, but not limited to, an increase
in the cost of natural gas purchased by the city from its supplier,
installation of additional appliances or equipment in the premises that use
natural gas, and/or abnormal changes in normal expected weather conditions. Due
to said factors, the city hereby reserves the right to revise the monthly
budget bill from time to time to adjust for such factors when said change in
rates or usage variations from the estimated quantities are substantial. The
director of public works and utilities and the city clerk may adopt reasonable
rules and regulations required for determining the standards when said monthly
budget bills may be revised pursuant to the provisions of this section.
Furthermore, the city clerk and the director of public works and utilities
shall have the right to consult with and rely upon the opinion of outside
engineers or other qualified experts recognized in the field of natural gas
usage and cost thereof in determining when and to what extent monthly budget
bills need to be adjusted.
   (H)   Any agreement, once signed, shall automatically renew itself for an
additional identical budget fiscal year last elected by the customer unless
either party to the written agreement notifies the other in writing thirty five
(35) days before the last day of the fiscal budget year in question that said
party desires to terminate the agreement providing for budget billing.
   (I)   The written agreement shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of each party to said agreement, subject to the limited exception set forth in
subsection (J) of this section.
   (J)   If a customer electing budget billing sells the premises in question,
or if the customer is a tenant under a lease, then budget billing for natural
gas shall cease as of the date the customer relinquishes possession of the
premises. The customer shall have the responsibility of notifying the city not
less than five (5) days prior to the date that possession will be relinquished.
Failure to notify shall result in the city having the right to base its
settlement as hereinafter defined as of a normal working day not more than
seven (7) days after notice is finally given to the city by the customer.
Settlement under this subsection shall be made on the basis of the customer
being billed for the actual gas used during the regular billing period in
question when possession will be relinquished from the first day of said
regular billing period through the date possession is relinquished (or a date
not more than 7 days after notice is finally given the City by the customer of
a sale or the termination of a lease in the event the customer fails to give
notice thereof to the City 5 days before the date that possession will be
relinquished). In addition, the customer shall be billed an amount necessary to
bring the total payments in balance with the total actual use for the regular
billing periods from the first day of the fiscal budget year in question
through the last day of the regular billing period prior to the billing period
in which notice is finally given by the customer to the City that a sale or
lease terminating either will or has occurred and either a relinquishment of
possession will occur on a given date or has occurred as of a certain date. If
the customer's total payments exceed the total gas usage for the entire period
defined in the previous two (2) sentences, a refund will be made by the City
within a reasonable time, but not to exceed forty five (45) days after the date
that the customer finally gives notice to the City under the provisions of this
subsection.
   Termination under this subsection shall not release the customer of any
liabilities created by reason of the written agreement. Furthermore, in case of
the death or incompetency of the customer, the customer's duly authorized
personal representative shall have the obligation of carrying out the terms and
provisions of not only this subsection, but the entire ordinance, including,
but not limited to, any notice requirements provided for herein.
   (K)   The Mayor and the City Clerk are hereby authorized on behalf of the
City to sign each agreement, incorporating the terms and conditions of the
ordinance codified herein, under which budget billing shall be made available
to any customer requesting said billing method for natural gas service. (Ord.
7/77, 7-18-1977)

administering assistance payments under the 1979-1980 Energy Crisis Assistance
Program to be applied first against any existing indebtedness owed by such
customers for the use of natural gas as of December 1, 1979, if any, and then
said assistance payments shall be then applied against any charges for natural
gas used and consumed by such customers for that period of time beginning on
December 1, 1979, and ending on September 30, 1980, unless said period is ended
sooner due to termination of the election to receive benefits under the Energy
Crisis Assistance Program by the City or the agency in question terminates
benefits under said program by proper notice to the City or the customer
discontinues the natural gas service provided by the City. (Ord. 29/79, 1-7-
1980)
   (C)   Any assistance payments received from the agency administering the
Energy Crisis Assistance Program shall not be used to pay for any reconnection
charge levied against any such customer eligible for benefits under said Act,
said reconnection fees being authorized and permitted pursuant to title 13,
"Schedule Of Fees", of this Code, nor shall such assistance payments under the
aforesaid Act be used to pay for any security deposit, if any, that may be
imposed by the City and required to be paid by any customer who has either
elected or will be electing to connect to the natural gas service owned and
operated by the City. (Ord. 16/2017, 6-5-2017)
   (D)   The City hereby agrees to credit all assistance payments received by
it as directed by the agency administering all of the benefits to be paid under
the 1979-1980 Energy Crisis Assistance Program, including, but not limited to,
the requirement that only one maximum allowable payment under said Act be
applied to the account of each such eligible person.
   (E)   The City hereby agrees to release any and all information that may be
required by the administering agency of the 1979-1980 Energy Crisis Assistance
Program in order to determine any particular customer's eligibility for
benefits under said Act, provided that said customer agrees and authorizes the
release of said information.
   (F)   The City may terminate its election to receive benefits under the
Energy Crisis Assistance Program upon giving a thirty (30) day written notice
thereof to the agency administering benefits under said Act.
   (G)   In the event an eligible customer owes any further balance due for
natural gas used as of the date of his or her application after applying the
maximum benefit due under the Energy Crisis Assistance Program, the City shall
then offer to the customer for that amount due and owing a deferred payment
arrangement or a level payment plan that is deemed reasonable and acceptable by
both the City and the customer, said plan to include payment of any
reconnection fee or security deposit.
   (H)   Any other provision in conflict herewith shall not be deemed to apply
to those customers of the natural gas system owned and operated by the City who
are eligible for assistance under the 1979-1980 Energy Crisis Assistance
Program.
   (I)   The Mayor, City Clerk, and/or the Director of Public Works and
Utilities are hereby authorized to execute and deliver with the City Seal
impressed thereon any and all documents that may be required in order for the
City to elect to receive all those benefits that it may be entitled to receive
under the provisions of the 1979-1980 Federal Energy Assistance Program. (Ord.

   (C)   If any customer of the City gas system executes an appropriate
delinquent gas bill payment contract, then the City shall not terminate such
natural gas service to said customer during the term of the delinquent gas bill
payment contract provided that the customer complies with all terms and
conditions of the aforesaid contract. However, if natural gas service has been
terminated to the customer at the time he executes an appropriate delinquent
gas bill payment contract, then the customer shall have the right to have the
natural gas service renewed and the fee for renewal as provided in title 13,
"Schedule Of Fees", of this Code, shall be added to the delinquent gas bill and
paid off in three (3) equal installments thirty (30) days apart notwithstanding

   (D)   The written contract providing for the payment of a delinquent gas

elect such option during the term of a written contract which is in default by
reason of the customer having failed to comply with the terms and provisions

gas customer of the City is a tenant or lessee of a landowner(s), then such
right of the customer to elect to pay a delinquent gas bill in three (3) equal

delinquent gas bill in three (3) equal installments refuses to sign the
delinquent gas bill payment contract, then such tenant or lessee shall not be
eligible to elect the benefits of deferred payment as herein provided. (Ord. 3/

who may have elected to pay a delinquent account in three (3) equal monthly
installments as provided under section

The term "City gas customer" whenever used herein shall include any person,
partnership, corporation or any other entity that has applied for and is

alteration shall be made and a permit secured. (Ord. 34/79, 4-30-1980)
10-14-11: PLOT PLAN:
When required by the building official, there shall be submitted a plot plan in
a form and size designated by the enforcing officer for filing permanently with
the permit record, drawn to scale, with all dimensions figured, showing
accurately the size and exact location of all proposed new construction and the
relation to other existing or proposed buildings or structures on the same lot
and other buildings or structures on an adjoining property within fifteen feet
(15') of the property lines. In the case of demolition, the plot plan shall
show the buildings or structures to be demolished and the buildings or
structures on the same lot that are to remain. (Ord. 34/79, 4-30-1980)
10-14-12: ACTION ON APPLICATION:
The enforcing officer shall examine applications for permits, within a
reasonable time after filing. If, after examination, he finds no objections to
the same and it appears that the proposed work will be in compliance with the
laws and ordinances applicable thereto and the proposed construction or work
will be safe, he shall approve such application and issue a permit for the
proposed work as soon as practicable. If his examination reveals otherwise, he
shall reject such application, note his findings in a written report to be
attached to the application and deliver a copy to the applicant. The reasonable
time provision for reviewing an application for permit is hereby deemed to be
absolutely essential in order to give the enforcing officer sufficient time to
determine if the application for permit is in compliance with all of the
ordinances duly enacted by the City. (Ord. 34/79, 4-30-1980)
10-14-13: APPROVAL OF PERMIT IN PART:
Nothing in this title or in any other ordinance enacted by the City shall be
construed to prevent the enforcing officer from issuing a permit for the
construction of part of a building or structure before the entire plans and
detailed statements of said building or structure have been submitted or
approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements had been
submitted for the same and have been found to comply with this title. (Ord. 34/

location of all new construction as shown on the approved plot plan or an
approved amendment thereto, shall be strictly adhered to. (Ord. 34/79, 4-30-
1980)
10-14-16: REDUCING OR DIMINISHING LOT AREA:
It shall be unlawful to reduce or diminish the area of a lot or plot of which a
plot plan has been filed and has been used as the basis for a permit, unless a
revised plot plan showing the proposed changes in conditions shall have been
filed and approved; provided that this shall not apply when the lot is reduced
by reason of a street opening or widening or other public improvement. (Ord.
34/79, 4-30-1980)
10-14-17: SIGNATURE REQUIRED ON PERMIT:
Every permit issued by the enforcing officer under the provisions of this title
shall have his signature affixed thereto; but this shall not prevent him from
authorizing a subordinate or other duly authorized City official to affix the
enforcing officer's signature. (Ord. 34/79, 4-30-1980)
10-14-18: POSTING OF PERMIT:
A copy of the permit shall be kept on the premises for public inspection during
the prosecution of the work and until the completion of the same. The enforcing
officer may require a certified copy of the approved plans to be kept on the
premises at all times from the commencement of the work to the completion
thereof. (Ord. 34/79, 4-30-1980)
10-14-19: COMMENCEMENT NOTICE TO BE GIVEN:
The enforcing officer shall be given at least twenty four (24) hours' notice of
the starting of work under a permit. (Ord. 34/79, 4-30-1980)

   (G)   Recognize the commercial communication requirements of all sectors of
the business and residential community. (Ord. 09/2016, 6-20-2016)
10-21-3: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and terms, when used in this chapter, shall have the
following meanings unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
   ANTENNA: Any structure or device not exceeding fifteen feet (15') in height
which is used for the purpose of collecting or transmitting electromagnetic
waves, including, but not limited to, directional antennas, such as panels,
microwave dishes, and satellite dishes and omnidirectional antennas, such as
whip antennas; provided, however, that any structure or device that functions
solely to provide television service to a single residential customer, such as
a satellite dish or roof mounted television antenna, shall not be considered an
"antenna" for purposes of this chapter and shall not be subject to the
regulations set forth in this chapter.
   COMMERCIAL WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES: Licensed commercial wireless
telecommunication services, including cellular, personal communication services
(PCS), specialized mobilized radio (SMR), enhanced specialized mobilized radio
(ESMR), paging, and similar services that are marketed to the general public.
   TOWER: Any ground or roof mounted pole, spire, antenna, structure, or
combination thereof taller than fifteen feet (15') (excepting ham radio towers
used for the purpose of collecting or transmitting signals originated by
amateur radio operators for noncommercial purposes) including supporting lines,
cables, wires, braces and masts, intended primarily for the purpose of mounting
an antenna, meteorological device, or similar apparatus above grade.
   TOWER, MULTIUSER: A tower to which is attached the antennas of more than one
commercial wireless telecommunication service provider or governmental entity.
   TOWER, SINGLE USER: A tower to which is attached only the antennas of a
single user, although the tower may be designed to accommodate the antennas of
multiple users as required in this chapter. (Ord. 09/2016, 6-20-2016)
10-21-4: COLLOCATION REQUIREMENTS:
All commercial wireless telecommunication towers erected, constructed, or
located within the city shall comply with the following requirements:
   (A)   A proposal for a new commercial wireless telecommunication service
tower shall not be approved unless the city council finds that the
telecommunications equipment planned for the proposed tower cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a one mile
search radius of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following
reasons:
      1.   The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of all
existing or approved towers or buildings, as documented by a qualified and
licensed professional engineer, and all of the existing or approved towers
cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the planned or
equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost.
      2.   The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned equipment at a tower or building as
documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer and interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
      3.   Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius
cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height necessary to function
reasonably as documented by a qualified and licensed professional engineer.
      4.   Other unforeseen reasons that make it unfeasible to locate the
planned telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or
building.
   (B)   Any proposed commercial wireless telecommunication service tower shall
be designed, structurally, electrically, and in all respects, to accommodate
both the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two (2)
additional users if the tower is over one hundred feet (100') in height, or for
at least one additional user if the tower is over sixty feet (60') in height.
Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the
tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights. (Ord. 09/2016, 6-20-
2016)
10-21-5: TOWER SITING PREFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS:
   (A)   Preferences: The following general preference standards apply to tower
and antenna siting locations within the city:
      1.   Wherever feasible, a distributed antenna system ("DAS") is preferred
to a tower.
      2.   Siting is preferred on city owned property on which towers and
antennas can be unobtrusively located with due regard to visibility, aesthetic
issues, traffic flow, public safety, health and welfare. Such sites may include
locating on existing buildings, collocating on existing towers, screened
rooftop mounts, water towers, billboards, electric substations, or other
camouflaged sites, but shall not include new towers. Barring such a location's
viability, siting is preferred on city owned sites in which the facility is
minimally obtrusive, has a minimal impact on the surrounding area, is an
appropriate distance from residential land uses, and has minimal impact on
residential uses, with due regard being given to the scale of the facility and
the surrounding area and the impact on the location.
      3.   Tower sites are preferred that, in comparison to alternative sites,
use lesser height, greater use of repeaters and incorporate reduced tower
visibility or camouflage technologies.
      4.   Preferable sitings are in the lowest possible areas of population
density and where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings, or other
structures provide the greatest amount of screening and have the least long
range visual effect.
      5.   Unless adequate coverage and adequate capacity cannot otherwise be
achieved, siting in high visual impact areas, environmentally sensitive areas,
and scenic or historic areas are not preferred.
   (B)   Limitations:
      1.   No tower shall be located on R-1, R-2, or R-3 residential district
property unless a licensed engineer certifies that the applicant will be
prohibited from providing commercial wireless telecommunication services unless
a tower is constructed in a residential zoning district. Construction,
maintenance, and use of a tower or antenna is otherwise authorized as a special
use for all other nonresidential property within the city.
      2.   No tower may be constructed, repaired, maintained or used on any
property unless first a permit is obtained under this chapter and a special use
permit is issued in compliance with this title. (Ord. 09/2016, 6-20-2016)
10-21-6: TOWER CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
   (A)   Permits:
      1.   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect,
construct in a place, place or re-erect, replace or repair any tower without
first making application to the city and securing a permit therefor as
hereinafter provided.
      2.   The applicant shall provide, at the time of application, sufficient
information to indicate that construction, installation and maintenance of the
antenna and tower will not create a safety hazard or damage to the property of
other persons.
      3.   Unless the applicant agrees otherwise, the city shall generally take
action on a request to collocate within ninety (90) days, and within one
hundred fifty (150) days for all other requests.
   (B)   Fee: The applicant shall pay a building permit fee in the amount of
two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
   (C)   Construction Requirements: All antennas and towers erected,
constructed or modified within the city and all wiring therefor, shall comply
with the following requirements:
      1.   All applicable provisions of this code.
      2.   The tower shall be certified by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer to conform to the latest structural standards and wind
loading requirements of the national building code (BOCA) and the Electronics
Industry Association.
      3.   With the exception of necessary electric and telephone service
connection lines, no part of any antenna or tower, nor any lines, cable,
equipment or wires or braces in connection with either shall at any time extend
across or over any part of the right of way, public street, highway, sidewalk,
or property line.
      4.   Towers and associated antennas shall be designed to conform with
accepted electrical engineering methods and practices and to comply with the
provisions of the national electrical code.
      5.   All signal and remote control conductors of low energy extending
substantially horizontally above the ground between a tower and antenna and a
structure, or between towers, shall be at least eight feet (8') above the
ground at all points unless buried underground.
      6.   Every tower affixed to the ground shall be protected to discourage
climbing of the tower by unauthorized persons.
      7.   All towers shall be constructed to conform with the requirements of
the occupational safety and health administration.
      8.   Metal towers shall be constructed of, or treated with, corrosive
resistant material. Wood poles shall be impregnated with rot resistant
substances.
   (D)   Existing Antennas And Towers: Antennas and towers in existence as of
the passage of May 9, 2016, which do not conform to or comply with this
chapter, are subject to the following provisions:
      1.   Towers may continue in use for the purpose now used and as now
existing, but may not be replaced or structurally altered without complying in
all respects with this chapter.
      2.   If such towers are hereafter damaged or destroyed due to any reason
or cause whatsoever, the tower may be repaired and restored to its former use,
location, and physical dimensions upon obtaining a building permit therefor,
but without otherwise complying with this section; provided, however, that if
the cost of repairing the tower to the former use, physical dimensions, and
location would be ten percent (10%) or more of the cost of a new tower of like
kind and quality, then the tower may not be repaired or restored, except in
full compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 09/2016, 6-20-2016)
10-21-7: TOWER AND ANTENNA DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
Proposed or modified towers and antennas shall meet the following design
requirements:
   (A)   Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment,
except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state
authorities, such as the federal aviation administration. For the purpose of
this subsection, camouflaging architectural treatment shall consist of
disguising the applicable tower as an object which would otherwise be fully
consistent with the surrounding area, such as a tree, church steeple, or
building spire, as appropriate. The camouflaging shall disguise the existence

2002)
11-3-5-2: THROUGH TRAFFIC DISCOURAGED:
Marginal access and local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage use by
through traffic. The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern should be
avoided, and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets
shall be encouraged to effect a more desirable street layout. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-
2002)
11-3-5-3: LIMITED ACCESS TO ARTERIALS:
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street,
access to said arterial may be limited by one of the following means:
   (A)   The subdivision of lots so that they back onto the arterial street and
front onto a parallel local street (double frontage lots), coupled with the
installation of screening in a reserve (access restricting) strip along the
rear lot lines of such lots;
   (B)   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from
and generally at right angles to the arterial street; or
   (C)   A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting
strip, but having access thereto at suitable points. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)
11-3-5-4: DEAD END STREETS:
   (A)   Temporary Stub Streets: Streets shall be so arranged to provide for
the continuation of streets between adjacent properties when such continuation
is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire and police
protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation
comports with the municipal comprehensive plan. If the adjacent property is
owned by the developer (under the same ownership) and undeveloped and the
street must dead end temporarily, the right of way shall be extended to the
property line, and no strip that would prevent connections with future streets
shall be reserved. A temporary turnaround shall be provided at the terminus of
any temporary dead end street. If the adjacent property is under another
ownership there should be a permanent dead end.
   (B)   Permanent Dead End Streets: Cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length of
seven hundred fifty feet (750'). A cul-de-sac turnaround, having a minimum
right of way diameter of ninety eight feet (98'), a minimum pavement return
radius of twenty five feet (25'), and a pavement diameter of seventy five feet
(75'), shall be provided at the end of every permanent dead end street. (Ord.

alley. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)
11-3-5-6: INTERSECTIONS:
   (A)   Only Two Streets: Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any
one point.
   (B)   Right Angles: Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly
as possible at right angles; in no case shall two (2) streets intersect at an
angle of less than eighty degrees (80°) or more than one hundred degrees
(100°). An oblique street shall be curved approaching an intersection and shall
be approximately at right angles with said intersection for at least one
hundred feet (100') therefrom.
   (C)   Alignment: Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on
the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less
than one hundred twenty five feet (125') shall not be permitted, except where
the intersected street has divided lanes without median breaks at either
intersection. Intersections involving collector or arterial streets shall be at
least eight hundred feet (800') apart.
   (D)   Curb Radii: To permit safe vehicular movement at corners, the minimum
curb radius at the intersection of two (2) streets shall be fifteen feet (15')
where both streets are marginal access or local and at other intersections, not
less than twenty five feet (25').
   (E)   Grade: Intersections shall be designed with a minimum grade of 0.5
percent. In hilly terrain, an area having not greater than a two percent (2%)
slope for a distance of sixty feet (60') from the nearest right of way line of
the intersecting street shall be provided at the approach to an intersection.
   (F)   Cross Slope: The cross slopes of all streets, including intersections,
shall not exceed three percent (3%).
   (G)   Adequate Sightlines: Where any street intersection will involve earth
banks or existing vegetation, the developer shall cut such ground and/or
vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right
of way to the extent necessary to provide adequate sight distance in accordance
with the following chart:
      30 mph   130 feet each way from intersection
      35 mph   155 feet each way from intersection
For design speeds exceeding thirty five (35) miles per hour, sight distance
will be determined based upon AASHTO criteria. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)
11-3-5-7: REVERSE CURVES:
A tangent at least fifty feet (50') long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on local streets and one hundred feet (100') long on collector streets.

11-3-5-8: ROAD DEDICATIONS AND RESERVATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO STREETS:
   (A)   New Perimeter Streets: Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an
existing half street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The planning
commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves
and dedicates the entire required street right of way width within his own
subdivision boundaries.
   (B)   Existing Roads: Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or
when the comprehensive plan, official map, or zoning setback regulations
indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of
some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to improve
and dedicate at his expense such areas for widening or realignment of such
roads as are specifically and uniquely attributable to his subdivision and to
reserve for public use any portion of the right of way determined not to be
specifically and uniquely attributable to his subdivision.
   (C)   Excess Right Of Way: Right of way in excess of the standards set forth
in the "table of street redesign specifications" of this section
11-3-5, shall be required to be dedicated when:
      1.   Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate
earth slopes; or
      2.   Due to the location of railroad tracks, additional width is needed
to construct overpasses, underpasses, and approaches thereto.
   (D)   Specifically And Uniquely Attributable Defined: For purposes of this
section, the phrase "specifically and uniquely attributable" shall mean as a
minimum that areas currently zoned or to be zoned single-family for residential
uses in the comprehensive plan shall require marginal access, local, or
collector streets, depending on density; that areas currently zoned or to be
zoned for multi-family residential uses in the comprehensive plan shall require
local, boulevard, collector, minor arterial, or principal arterial streets,
depending on density; that areas currently zoned or to be zoned for commercial
uses in the comprehensive plan shall require local, collector, minor arterial,
or principal arterial streets, depending on whether same is a neighborhood,
community, or regional area; and that areas currently zoned or to be zoned for
industrial uses in the comprehensive plan shall require collector, minor
arterial, or principal arterial streets, depending on the size of the
industrial area. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)

works and utilities. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)
11-3-13: DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS:
   (A)   Drainage Improvements: The planning commission shall not recommend the
approval of plat unless, the director of public works and utilities determines
that the proposed provisions for storm water drainage are adequate within
boundaries of the subdivision. Drainage improvements in the subdivision shall
be coordinated with existing and planned drainage improvements elsewhere so as
to form an integrated city system. The storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system and shall meet the
following design criteria:
      1.   Principal And Minor Arterial Streets:
         (a)   Flow from a "10-year storm" shall not inundate the center twenty
feet (20') of the pavement.

         (b)   Flow from a "50-year storm" shall be carried without damage to
any building.
   (B)   Catch Basins Or Inlets: Catch basins or inlets, if required, shall be
constructed so that the majority of surface water shall be intercepted before
reaching the intersection, and not carried for a distance of more than four
hundred feet (400') of the pavement.
   (C)   Accommodation Of Upstream Drainage Areas: A culvert or other drainage
facility large enough to accommodate potential runoff from the entire drainage
area upstream from the proposed subdivision shall be provided in accordance
with the city's standard specifications. Potential runoff shall be determined
on the basis of the maximum development of the upstream area that is permitted
or to be permitted under the comprehensive plan.
   (D)   Areas Subject To Flooding: Whenever a plat is submitted for an area
that is subject to flooding, the city council may require appropriate
protective measures, including the filling of the flood prone area to a level
equal to the regulatory flood elevation, if any. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)
11-3-14: SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL:
In the development of any subdivision, the following erosion and sedimentation
control regulation shall be observed:
   (A)   The developer shall protect the development site from soil erosion and
shall protect downstream property from sedimentation deposits during the
construction of the subdivision. Practices contained in "Procedures And
Standards For Urban Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" shall
be employed in the preparation of an erosion and sedimentation control plan
which shall be approved by the director of public works and utilities prior to
any earth disturbing activity taking place. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)
11-3-15: DEDICATIONS FOR PUBLIC USE:
The city council may require the developer to dedicate (i.e., to transfer
without compensation) to the city of Aledo or other appropriate governmental
entity suitable parcels of land within the subdivision for public purposes
provided such facilities are otherwise required by this title. Any such
dedicated area shall be shown on the final plat. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)
11-3-16: RESERVATIONS FOR PUBLIC USE:
Besides requiring the developer to dedicate parcels for public purposes, the
city council may require that he reserve land for parks, playgrounds, schools,
or other public purposes in locations designated in the city's comprehensive
plan. Since public acquisition of reserved land requires compensation, it is
not essential that the need for such land be uniquely and specifically
attributable to the subdivision 1 .
   (A)   Adopted: There is hereby adopted an official map dated, to be
determined, which shall be applicable to all land situated within the city, and
shall also be applicable to contiguous territory within one and one-half (11/2)
miles from the corporate limits of the city and not included within the
corporate limits of any other municipality. The official map shall be filed in
the office of the city clerk and is made part of this title by reference.
   (B)   Planned Public Improvements To Be Shown On Map: The official map may
show indication of sites for planned public facilities. Public facility sites
which may be indicated on the official map may include, but are not limited to:
sites for new trafficways; school sites; recreational sites; public building
sites; and sites for future storm damage, electrical or other public service or
utility easements.
   (C)   Availability Of Sites For Planned Public Improvements:
      1.   Whenever the official map indicates the necessity for providing a
site for a planned public facility, the council may require that the site for
the public use be designated on the subdivision plat before granting approval
to such plat; and, furthermore, that the site be held for that specific public
use for a period of one year from the date of approval of the final plat. When
such designation has been required, the council shall notify the responsible
public agency in writing of the designation within ten (10) days.
      2.   Whenever a site for public use, shown on the official map, has been
required to be indicated on a subdivision plat, the responsible agency having
jurisdiction of such use shall acquire the land so designated by purchase or
commence proceedings to acquire the land by condemnation within one year from
date of final approval of the plat; and, if it does not do so within such
period of one year, the land so designated may then be used by the owners in
any other manner consistent with this title, the zoning ordinance, or any other
provision of this code or other ordinance of the city.
   (D)   Amendments Or Additions To The Official Map: Amendments to the
official map, including the indication of additional public sites to be shown
on the map, shall be considered amendments to this title and therefore shall be
as specified in this title for amendments to this title. Any public agency
requesting the establishment of the official map of a future public site or
easement which is not included in the comprehensive plan shall indicate to the
plan commission the need for the site in the particular location specified. The
plan commission, before making a favorable recommendation for the inclusion on
the official map of such site by the council, shall find that this public site
location is determined to be necessary to provide public service consistent
with the comprehensive plan of the community and shall so indicate in its
minutes. (Ord. 8/02, 9-16-2002)
