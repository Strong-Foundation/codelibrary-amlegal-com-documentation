purchasing the recording medium, whether disc, diskette, tape, or other medium.
If a request is not a request for a commercial purpose or a voluminous request,
the city may not charge the requester for the costs of any search for and
review of the records or other personnel costs associated with reproducing the
records. Except to the extent that the General Assembly expressly provides,
statutory fees applicable to copies of public records when furnished in a paper
format shall not be applicable to those records when furnished in an electronic
format.
      (2)   (a)   If a voluminous request is for electronic records and those
records are not in a portable document format (PDF), the city may charge up to
$20 for not more than two megabytes of data, up to $40 for more than two, but

rights of the general public and is not for the principal purpose of personal
or commercial benefit. For purposes of this division (C), COMMERCIAL BENEFIT
shall not apply to requests made by news media when the principal purpose of

amount of the waiver or reduction, the city may take into consideration the
amount of materials requested and the cost of copying them.

provide the requester with an accounting of all fees, costs, and personnel

32.50. Failure to comply with a written request, extend the time for response,
or deny a request within five business days after its receipt shall be
considered a denial of the request. A public body that fails to respond to a
request within the requisite periods in this section but thereafter provides

for those copies. A public body that fails to respond to a request received may
not treat the request as unduly burdensome under §
32.48.
(5 ILCS 140/3(d))
   (B)   The time periods for compliance or denial of a request to inspect or
copy records set out in 5 ILCS 140/3 shall not apply to requests for records

§ 32.47 EXTENSION OF TIME LIMIT; NOTICE.
   (A)   (1)   The time for response under this chapter may be extended by the
city for not more than five business days from the original due date for any of
the following reasons:
         (a)   The requested records are stored in whole or in part at other
locations than the office having charge of the requested records;
         (b)   The request requires the collection of a substantial number of
specified records;
         (c)   The request is couched in categorical terms and requires an
extensive search for the records responsive to it;
         (d)   The requested records have not been located in the course of
routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them;
         (e)   The requested records require examination and evaluation by
personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they
are exempt from disclosure under § 7 of the Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS
140/7) or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions;
         (f)   The request for records cannot be complied with by the city
within the time limits prescribed by §
32.44 without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the city;
and
         (g)   There is a need for consultation, which shall be conducted with
all practicable speed, with another public body or among two or more components
of the a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in
the subject matter of the request.
      (2)   The person making a request and the city may agree in writing to
extend the time for compliance for a period to be determined by the parties. If
the requester and the city agree to extend the period for compliance, a failure
by the city to comply with any previous deadlines shall not be treated as a
denial of the request for the records.
(5 ILCS 140/3(e))
   (B)   (1)   When additional time is required for any of the above reasons,
the resident shall, within five business days after receipt of the request,
notify the person making the request of the reasons for the extension and the
date by which the response will be forthcoming.
      (2)   Failure to respond within the time permitted for extension shall be
considered a denial of the request. A public body that fails to respond to a
request within the time permitted for extension but thereafter provides the
requester with copies of the requested public records may not impose a fee for
those copies. A public body that requests an extension and subsequently fails
to respond to the request may not treat the request as unduly burdensome under
§
32.48.
(5 ILCS 140/3(f))
§ 32.48 UNDULY BURDENSOME REQUESTS.
   (A)   Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be
complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for
the city, there is no way to narrow the request, and the burden on the city
outweighs the public interest in the information. Before invoking this

PURCHASES/BIDDING PROCEDURES
§ 37.15 CITY OF WOOD RIVER SPENDING MANUAL.
   (A)   Introduction/statement of policy.
      (1)   The purpose of this purchasing manual is to provide the City of
Wood River staff with guidelines and directions for the acquisition of goods
and services. When used with good judgment and common sense, the policies and
procedures conveyed within will allow the city to obtain required supplies and
services efficiently and economically. City Council approval adopts this manual
as city policy to replace any previous purchasing policy.
      (2)   The manual is divided into sections dealing with purchasing
policies and procedures. The policy sections contain all the purchasing
policies reviewed and recommended by the City Manager and Director of Finance
and adopted by the City Council, which must be adhered to by city employees.
The procedures sections provide a "how to" guide for processing purchase
requisitions, purchase orders, travel authorization and expense reports and
other procedures regarding payment processing.
      (3)   Employees are expected to read the policy manual and provide the
Department of Finance with feedback regarding the policies and procedures
contained within. This manual is designed to be a fluid document and will be
modified from time to time to conform with changes in legislation, technology
and actual practice. Although it may not answer every question related to
purchasing practices, it does provide general guidelines for purchasing
activities. Employees who need help dealing with specific situations not
covered by the manual should contact the Director of Finance for assistance.
      (4)   The City Manager shall be the final authority with regards to
enforcement of any of the provisions of this manual. Failure to follow the
procedures outlined in this manual may lead to disciplinary action in
accordance with the provisions of the City of Wood River Personnel Policy
Manual.
   (B)   Purchasing policies.
      (1)   Code of Ethics.
         (a)   All city personnel engaged in purchasing and related activities
shall conduct business dealings in a manner above reproach in every respect.
Transactions relating to expenditure of public funds require the highest degree
of public trust to protect the interests of the city and the residents of Wood
River. City employees shall strive to:
            1.   Ensure that public money is spent efficiently and effectively
and in accordance with statutes, regulations, and city policies;
            2.   Maintain confidentiality at all times;
            3.   Not accept gifts or favors from current or potential suppliers
which might compromise the integrity of their purchasing function;
            4.   Specify generic descriptions of goods wherever possible in
lieu of brand names when compiling specifications;
            5.   Never allow purchase orders for identical goods or services to
be split or variations to City Council approvals to be made in order to
circumvent established policy;
            6.   Purchase without favor or prejudice;
            7.   Ensure that all potential suppliers are provided with adequate
and identical information upon which to base their offer or quotation and that
any subsequent information is made available to all bidders; and
            8.   Establish and maintain procedures to ensure that fair and
equal consideration is given to each offer or quotation received.
         (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the City Manager to determine
if a violation of this Code of Ethics has occurred and if disciplinary action
is necessary in accordance with the city's Personnel Manual.
      (2)   Gifts and gratuities: city guidelines for accepting.
         (a)   City personnel should be aware that offers of gratitude from
vendors can be designed to compromise objective judgment in product or service
selection. Accordingly, it is city policy to observe the highest standards of
ethics and to shield the employee, the city and the vendor from any suggestion
or appearance of conflict of interest.
         (b)   No employee shall permit any influence by vendors which could
conflict with the best interest of the city or prejudice the city's reputation.
Expenditures of city funds to vendors shall not by intention personally benefit
any person officially connected with the city. Employees shall strive to follow
the following guidelines:
            1.   Tangible gifts or gratuities shall not be accepted where their
value exceeds $100 per vendor annually. Such gifts should be returned with a
statement of city policy. Promotional or advertising items of nominal value
such as key chains, pens, coffee mugs, calendars and holiday candy are
acceptable.
            2.   Association with vendor representatives at business meals or
business organization meetings is occasionally necessary and is neither
questionable nor unethical, provided the individual keeps himself/herself free
of obligation.
            3.   Solicitation of vendors for merchandise or certificates to
serve as door prizes or favors is normally prohibited. However, exceptions may
be approved by the City Manager.
            4.   Corporate discounts granted to city employees are acceptable
only if they are offered to all city employees and other corporate clients of
the vendor.
         (c)   If in any doubt about the propriety of accepting a gift, the
matter should be referred to the department director who will, if necessary,
discuss the matter with the City Manager or his/her designee.
      (3)   Advanced approval of city purchases required.
         (a)   No employee shall purchase goods or services on behalf of the
city without first seeking approval as required by this policy. All purchases
shall require advance approval of the appropriate department director and the
City Manager in accordance with the guidelines described below:
 
Dollar Limits     Required Approvals
Under $5,000      Department director or Supervisor if no department director
                  exists
$5,000 - $24,999  Department director and City Manager
$25,000 and above Department director, City Manager and City Council
 
         (b)   Approval for purchases shall occur before the purchase is made.
At the discretion of the department director, approval levels for supervisors
may be increased to an amount not to exceed the department director's
authority. In addition, the City Manager can delegate approval authority to a
department director at their discretion in the event they are unavailable to
approve purchases.
   (C)   Competitive quotes and exceptions to the policy.
      (1)   General policy for soliciting quotes.
         (a)   Employees are responsible for obtaining quotes for purchases of
services and products in the instances outlined below. When submitting a
purchase request prior to purchase, quotes shall be attached to a purchase
request form (see model form at the end of this section) and returned to the
appropriate department for a purchase order to be generated after signatures
are obtained. Requests submitted without the required quotes or a satisfactory
explanation of why quotes were not obtained (e.g. sole source, emergency,
standardized vendor, and the like) will be returned to the originator without
approval.
            1.   Up to $4,999. Employees are encouraged to seek verbal quotes
at least once a year.
            2.   $5,000 - $14,999. Three verbal quotes should be obtained where
possible. The quotes should be included on the purchase request form. Physical
records regarding the dates, contacts, and quotes received shall be retained in
the department's files for auditing purposes.
            3.   $15,000 - $24,999. Three written quotes should be obtained
where possible. The quotes should be listed on the purchase request form and
copies of the quotes attached to it. Hard copies shall also be retained in the
department's files for auditing purposes.
            4.   $25,000 and above. Must be competitively bid in accordance
with state law and city ordinances. City Council approval is required for all
contracts of this dollar amount.
         (b)   Supplies purchased more than once during a fiscal year (e.g.
forms, copier supplies, and the like) do not need quotes every time a purchase
is made. However, competitive quotes for these items should be sought on
occasion to ensure that vendor pricing remains competitive.
         (c)   The city acknowledges that three quotes will not always be
possible to obtain for every purchase outlined above where quotes are required.
It will be up to the responsible employee to provide information as to why the
minimum quotes were not obtained, and to obtain permission to make the purchase
from the City Manager in such an instance.
      (2)   Joint purchasing.
         (a)   State of Illinois.
            1.   City employees are authorized to obtain goods and services
using the State of Illinois joint purchasing program. When available through
the state program, it is not necessary for city employees to obtain quotes or
to competitively bid the goods or services which are sought. Employees shall be
responsible, however, for ensuring that the goods or services are of a quality
sufficient to meet the city's needs and that pricing is competitive.
            2.   When making purchases using the state's assigned vendor,
employees shall submit a purchase order to the vendor directly and shall
include the State of Illinois contract number and the city's assigned joint
purchasing member I.D. number (L2590) on the purchase order. This information
should be included on the purchase order.
         (b)   Other units of government. Employees are permitted to purchase
items jointly with other units of government when the price of the goods or
services sought is competitive and the quality meets the city's standards.
Prior to initiating the transaction, employees shall seek the approval of the
City Manager or Director of Finance or designee. Questions regarding joint
purchasing opportunities should be directed to the City Manager or Director of
Finance.
      (3)   Sole source purchases.
         (a)   Contracts for parts, supplies or equipment that are available
only from a single source are referred to as sole source purchases. Sole source
procurements may arise from the following circumstances:
            1.   Products or equipment for which there is no comparable
competitive product or is available only from one supplier;
            2.   Public utility services from natural or regulated monopolies;
            3.   A component or replacement part for which there is no
commercially available substitute, and which can be obtained only from the
manufacturer, or supplier for the manufacturer;
            4.   An item where compatibility is the overriding consideration,
such as computer software; and
            5.   A used item, for example, a television transmitter tower, a
used car or truck, or anything that has been previously used and is now for
sale, that becomes immediately available and is subject to prior sale.
         (b)   These items shall not be subject to requirements for seeking
competitive quotes or bids. However, purchases in excess of $25,000 shall be
presented to the City Council prior to acquisition with a request to waive
bids, approve the purchase and enter into a formal contract.
      (4)   Emergency purchases policy.
         (a)   Emergencies are defined as events that could not have been
foreseen where immediate action is necessary to safeguard the public's health
and safety. In the event of an emergency affecting the public health and
safety, the City Manager or his/her designee may authorize a vendor to provide
products and/or materials and to perform work necessary to resolve such
emergency without formal bid solicitation. Documentation of the emergency and
the need for immediate action shall be presented to the City Council in a
reasonable period of time following resolution of the crisis. What is deemed to
be an "emergency" shall be determined by the City Manager or his/her designee.
         (b)   The following procedures shall be followed in the event an
emergency purchase order is needed: an emergency purchase order can be used
authorizing a vendor to perform any and all work necessary only if the public
health, safety, and services could be affected. The Department Director will
issue an emergency purchase order to the vendor. If the emergency and the need
for immediate action exceed $25,000, documentation shall be presented to the
City Manager or his/her designee prior to such authorization.
         (c)   After the emergency has been resolved, the Department Director
shall submit a purchase requisition for the goods purchased. The department
shall explain the need for the emergency purchase order and reference the
purchase order number that was issued to the vendor.
         (d)   The Director of Finance or his/her designee will then add the
requisition to the emergency purchase order.
      (5)   Competitive bidding exemption.
         (a)   When, in the ordinary course of city business, no single
purchase of, or individual contract for, specific types of supplies, materials
or services exceeds $25,000, but the total dollar value of all purchases and/or
contracts for said specific types of supplies, materials, or services during
the city's fiscal year does exceed said amount, said purchases may not be
subject to the competitive bidding requirement and may not require the City
Council to waive the competitive bidding requirement. At his/her discretion,
the City Manager shall determine whether these purchases require City Council
approval of a waiver of bids. Where a bid waiver is determined to not be
necessary, said purchases shall still be subject to the requirements of
division (C)(1) above concerning quote solicitation for purchases under
$25,000.
         (b)   It is not the intent of this division to encourage the
circumvention of the bidding requirements and, to the extent practicable, city
staff is encouraged to rely upon the competitive bidding process. Rather, the
competitive bidding exemption provided by this section is intended to recognize
and address those situations in which a competitive bidding requirement is not
necessarily practicable and can be eliminated without jeopardizing the city's
ability to obtain a low and competitive price from a qualified responsible
contractor/vendor. An example would be automotive service on police and fire
equipment which requires continuity of service as a health and safety concern,
but the aggregate cost of the services may exceed $25,000 in a given fiscal
year; in this example, it is not safe, efficient, or practicable to obtain bids
for all of the service necessary to keep the police and fire vehicles properly
serviced and available to serve the citizens of Wood River.
   (D)   Competitive bidding and requests for professional services.
      (1)   When a formal bid is required.
         (a)   All purchases of goods or services exceeding $25,000, except as
noted in division (C) above, shall be subject to the competitive bidding
process, including a notice of municipal letting for Council approval, and
shall be let, by free and open competitive bidding after advertisement, to the
lowest responsible bidder or any other bidder whom the City Council deems to be
in the best interest of the city.
         (b)   With the exception of bids for capital projects handled through
an engineering contract, all bids shall be issued using the city's standard bid
document as approved by the City Attorney.
      (2)   Preparing the bid document.
         (a)   It is the responsibility of the respective departments to
prepare the bid document. When preparing the bid document, each department
shall be responsible for obtaining a bid document number from the executive
assistant and for ensuring that the most recent version of the bid document has
been used.
         (b)   All bid documents should attempt to contain the following
information:
            1.   Cover memo (includes signature line for City Manager
approval);
            2.   Table of contents;
            3.   Notice to bidders;
            4.   General terms, conditions, and instructions;
            5.   Specifications of the item/service;
            6.   Bid proposal form;
            7.   An appropriate sample contract (required if the bid is for
goods, services, construction services, or goods and installation services);
and
            8.   All contractor certification forms (e.g. sexual harassment,
tax compliance, contract execution).
         (c)   After the bid document has been prepared, it may be reviewed and
approved by the applicable department director and City Manager. Then a "notice
of municipal letting" request asking to go out for bids, including bids specs
if possible, must be approved by the City Council.
         (d)   The department director will be responsible for forwarding the
legal notice to the newspaper for publication. A legal notice of the bid must
be placed in a newspaper with a general circulation in the city at least 15
days prior to the bid opening, and in accordance with Illinois Law.
         (e)   The department director may mail the approved document to
prospective bidders. Bid documents should not be mailed to bidders before the
ad is placed in the newspaper. This will help ensure that all prospective
bidders have the same amount of time to complete the bid document.
      (3)   Additional requirements for the bid document.
         (a)   Bid bonds and the like. A bid bond, cashier's check, certified
check, or other approved security in an amount equal to 5% of the bid is
required to guarantee the successful bidder will sign a contract in the
following instances: (1) the bid is for a construction project; and (2) any
other bid for which the City Manager or Director of Finance deems it necessary
to protect the interest of the city.
         (b)   Performance bond. When preparing the bid document, departments
should consider whether to require contractors to provide a performance bond if
awarded the contract. In instances where the bid is for construction services
or significant building improvements, it is customary to require the contractor
to provide a performance bond. A performance bond, issued by a surety company,
stipulates a legal, written obligation to guarantee 100% payment for any
financial loss caused by default of the contractor. When assigned to the City
of Wood River, it grants an assurance as to the performance and successful
completion of the terms of the contract and assures payment of the taxes,
licenses or assessments associated with the contract. The contractor shall
provide the performance bond with the appropriate labor and material bonds
within ten calendar days of award of the bid. Bonds required to guarantee
performance and payment for labor and material for the work shall be in a form
acceptable to the city and shall provide that they shall not terminate on
completion of the work, but shall be reduced to 10% of the contract sum upon
the date of final payment by the city for a period of one year to cover a
warranty and maintenance period which contractor agrees shall apply to all
material and workmanship for one year from the date of issuance of the final
payment by the city.
         (c)   Insurance. Contractor agrees to provide and maintain
certificates of insurance and endorsements evidencing the minimum insurance
coverage and limits set forth below during the term of the contract. Such
policies shall be in force and from companies acceptable and satisfactory to
the owner to afford protection against all claims for damages to public or
private property, and injuries to persons, arising out of and during the
contract term. A copy of the certificate of insurance and endorsement section
of the insured's policy shall name the City of Wood River, its officers,
agents, employees, representatives and assigns as additional insured. The
policy of insurance shall contain no provisions that invalidate the naming of
the owner as additional insured. The insurance coverage and limits set forth
below shall be deemed to be minimum coverage and shall not be construed in any
way as a limitation on contractor's duty to carry adequate insurance or on
contractor's liability for losses or damages under this contract. The minimum
insurance coverage and limits that shall be maintained by the contractor and
his sub-contractors at all times while providing, performing, or completing the
work are as follows:
            1.   Worker's compensation. The contractor is required to carry,
with a company authorized under the laws of the State of Illinois, a policy for
protection against liability under the Worker's Compensation and the
Occupational Disease Statutes of the State of Illinois with limits of not less
than $1,000,000 per claim. If the minimum amount of insurance required is
increased by the State of Illinois, that new minimum amount shall automatically
replace the stated amount in this policy.
            2.   General liability. The contractor shall carry a comprehensive
general umbrella liability policy for all operations with limits of not less
than $1,000,000 each accident for bodily injury liability and not less than
$1,000,000 each accident for property damage liability. If the minimum amount
of insurance required is increased by the State of Illinois, that new minimum
amount shall automatically replace the stated amount in this policy.
            3.   Professional liability insurance. The contractor shall carry a
minimum of $1,000,000. If the minimum amount of insurance required is increased
by the State of Illinois, that new minimum amount shall automatically replace
the stated amount in this policy. All such insurance must include an
endorsement whereby the insurer agrees to notify the owner at least 30 days
prior to non-renewal, reduction, or cancellation. The contractor shall cease
operations if the insurance is canceled or reduced below the required amount of
coverage. All costs for insurance as specified herein will not be paid for
separately but shall be considered as incidental to the contract. The City
Manager may require more insurance minimums based on the scope of the project.
            4.   Additional documents required. The following forms must also
be attached in order to be acceptable: hold harmless and indemnity agreement,
certificate of compliance with the substance abuse prevention program
certification, certificate that the contractor is not barred from contracting
with unit of local government because of conviction of an offense related to
bidding, prevailing wage information, and a certificate on non-delinquency of
tax. The City Manager may require additional documents depending on the scope
of the project.
            5.   Bid submittal. All companies or individuals who wish to bid on
a good or service must submit their bids in a sealed envelope before the
deadline of the bid. Upon receipt of a sealed bid, the City Clerk will initial
and stamp the date and time of receipt on the outside of the envelope. The
sealed bid will be held until the bid opening and the appropriate department
will publicly open and read the bids. If bid documents are to be distributed at
the City Hall, the front desk personnel must be supplied with at least three
copies (or more depending on the number of bidders expected) of the bid
document.
            6.   Pre-bid conference. If a pre-bid conference is conducted,
departments should specify in the notice to bidders whether attendance is a
mandatory condition of bidding. At the pre-bid conference, the responsible
department should ensure that all attendees sign a "sign-in" sheet to ensure
compliance with this requirement of bidding. Failure to attend a mandatory pre-
bid conference shall disqualify a bidder from being awarded the contract
unless, at the department's discretion, bidders are allowed to not attend by
signing a waiver.
         (d)   Bid opening procedures.
            1.   All sealed bids shall be publicly opened by the City Manager
and/or department director or his/her designee at the time stated in the legal
notice. At least one other employee shall serve as a witness and tabulate the
bid results. All proposals shall be open to public inspection and a tabulation
of all bids shall be available from the department director. The following
procedures must be completed prior to the bid opening:
               a.   If the bid opening will be conducted at the City Hall, the
originating department shall be responsible for reserving a conference room for
the day and time. This can be done by contacting the City Clerk.
               b.   All bids must be received before the deadline on the day of
the bid. Each bid shall be marked with the initials of the city recipient and a
date and time of receipt of the bid document. City Hall front desk personnel
should be notified of the time and place of the bid opening for that day and
reminded that any bids received after the deadline for accepting bids should be
labels "not received in time" on the bid document and initialed and marked with
the date and time of receipt.
               c.   A bid tabulation form must be completed. The outline of the
bid proposal form may be used to do this. During the bid opening, both the
person opening the bids and the person tabulating the bids must sign the bid
tabulation sheet as witnesses.
            2.   If bid security is required, it shall be forwarded to the City
Clerk immediately following the bid opening. Procedures for depositing and
returning bid security is described below in division (D)(3)(e) below.
         (e)   Post bid opening requirements.
            1.   After the bid opening has taken place, the department director
shall prepare a memorandum that explains the purpose of the bid, includes the
names and addresses of the companies who submitted bids as well as the amount
each company bid, and recommends which company should be awarded the bid. The
recommendation should be based on the following:
               a.   The ability, capacity, and skill of the bidder to perform
the contract to provide the service required;
               b.   Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the
service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference;
               c.   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience
and efficiency of the bidder;
               d.   The quality of performance of previous contracts of
services;
               e.   The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with
laws and ordinance relating to the contract or service;
               f.   The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of
the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service;
               g.   The quality, availability, and adaptability of the supplies
or contractual service to the particular use required;
               h.   The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service for the use of the subject of the contract;
               i.   The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid;
               j.   Responsiveness to the exact requirements of the invitation
to bid;
               k.   Ability to work cooperatively with the city and its
administration; and
               l.   Past records of the bidder's transactions with the city or
with other entities as evidence of the bidder's responsibility, character,
integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, efficiency and cooperativeness.
            2.   Once approved by the department director, their memo
recommending award of bid should be given to the City Clerk.
            3.   With the exception of contracts let through an engineering
contract, all bid files shall be maintained by the department requesting the
bid. After the issuing department has prepared the City Council agenda item,
the bid file shall be sent to the City Clerk along with the bid packages,
original bid tabulation sheet, and all other documentation. After Council
approval, the bids will be stored in the City Clerk's office where they can be
accessed when necessary (state law requires bid files be maintained for ten
years following the bid opening). The signed contract will be forwarded to the
City Clerk for safekeeping after it is received. Signed contracts, certificates
of insurance and performance bonds must be obtained from the contractor before
work begins. It is the responsibility of the applicable department to ensure
that the city's contract has been signed, and certificate of insurance and
performance bond obtained before work begins.
            4.   The City Clerk or designee shall be responsible for handling
bid deposits. If a bid deposit was required, it must be returned to all except
the three lowest responsive and responsible bidders on each contract within 14
calendar days after the opening of the bid and within 24 hours of when the
award letter is mailed. The bid deposit of the accepted bidder is to be
returned only after acceptance by the city of satisfactory performance bond
where such bond is required or completion of contract where no performance bond
is required. The remaining bid deposits of each contractor should be returned
within 14 days after the City Council has awarded the contract.
         (f)   Waiver of competitive bidding. The City Council, by a two-thirds
vote of all the Councilpersons then holding office, may waive the bidding
procedures and enter into a contract or agreement. Requests for bid waivers
shall be made only when goods or services are proprietary (i.e. sole source),
where standardization is necessary or desirable (e.g. furniture), in
emergencies as defined in this manual, or when it is in the best interests of
the city to do so. In any instance, a statement justifying the need for a bid
waiver shall be included in the department's recommendation and accompany the
memo for inclusion on the City Council's agenda.
         (g)   Requests for professional services.
            1.   Some contracts, by their nature, are not adapted to award by
competitive bidding. Examples include, but are not limited to, contracts for
the services of individuals possessing a high degree of professional skill
where the education, experience or character of the individual is a significant
factor in determining their ability to meet the city's needs. These contracts
generally result from a request for proposal (RFP) solicited from consultants
for "professional services." Other than architects, engineers, and land
surveyors, which are discussed below, examples of "professional services" may
include, but are not limited to, lawyers and consultants.
            2.   The city is required by the Local Government Professional
Services Selection Act to follow specific procedures when hiring an architect,
engineer, or land surveyor. The procedures must be followed unless (1) an
emergency situation exists and an architect, engineer or land surveyor must be
selected in an expeditious manner; or (2) when the cost of such services "is
expected to be less than $40,000"; or (3) the city has a satisfactory
relationship for services with one or more firms." If none of these conditions
apply, the city must solicit proposals and adhere to the following
requirements:
               a.   Public notice. Permitting firms engaged in the lawful
practice of their professions to annually file a statement of qualifications
and performance data with the city. The city must also: (1) mail a notice
requesting a statement of interest in the specific project to all firms who
have a current statement of qualifications and performance data on file with
the city; and (2) place an advertisement in a local newspaper of general
circulation throughout the city, requesting a statement of interest in the
specific project and further requesting statements of qualifications and
performance data from those firms which do not have such a statement on file
with the city. Such advertisement shall state the day, hour and place the
statement of interest and the statements of qualifications and performance data
shall be due.
               b.   Selection procedure. The city then must evaluate the firms
submitting letters of interest, taking into account qualifications, ability of
professional personnel, past record and experience, performance data on file,
willingness to meet time and budget requirements, location, workload of the
firm and such other factors as the city may determine in writing are
applicable. The city may conduct discussions with and require public
presentations by firms deemed to be the most qualified regarding their
qualifications, approach to the project and ability to furnish the required
services.
               c.   On the basis of evaluations, discussions and presentations,
the city shall select no fewer than three firms which it determines to be the
most qualified to provide services for the project and rank them in order of
qualifications to provide services regarding the specific project. The city
shall then contact the firm ranked most preferred and attempt to negotiate a
contract at a fair and reasonable compensation, taking into account the
estimated value, scope, complexity, and professional nature of the services to
be rendered. If fewer than three firms submit letters of interest and the city
determines that one or both of those firms are so qualified, the city may
proceed to negotiate a contract.
               d.   Contract negotiation. The city shall prepare a written
description of the scope of the proposed services to be used as a basis for
negotiations and shall negotiate a contract with the highest qualified firm at
compensation the city determines in writing to be fair and reasonable. In
making this decision, the city shall take into account the estimated value,
scope, complexity and professional nature of the services to be rendered.
               e.   If the city is unable to negotiate a contract with the
preferred firm, negotiations with that firm shall be terminated. The city shall
then begin negotiations with the firm which is next preferred. If the city is
unable to negotiate a contract with that firm, negotiations with that firm
shall be terminated. The city shall then begin negotiations with the firm which
is next preferred.
               f.   If the city is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract
with any of the selected firms, it shall re-evaluate the architectural,
engineering or land surveying services requested, including the estimated
value, scope, and complexity and fee requirements. The city shall then compile
a second list of not less than three qualified firms and proceed in accordance
with these procedures.
            3.   If a contract is used other than the city's standard contract,
the following items should be included: indemnification, insurance, and venue.
This language can be obtained from the City Manager or the City Attorney.
            4.   If, after reviewing these procedures, employees have questions
regarding which services are exempt, they should contact the City Attorney for
clarification.
   (E)   Methods of payment processing.
      (1)   Regular purchase orders. All individual purchases over $5,000 shall
require the issuance of a regular purchase order to the vendor before an order
for goods or services is filled. No employee shall have the authority to
purchase items on the city's behalf without first entering a purchase
requisition and obtaining the required approvals from supervisory staff or the
City Council where applicable. Employees shall be responsible to plan for
purchases exceeding $5,000 in advance and should allow sufficient time to have
a requisition processed and purchase order issued to the vendor. With the
exception of emergency purchase orders, the Department of Finance will not
issue purchase order numbers in advance unless a requisition has been processed
and has received the necessary approvals. Receiving tickets will need to be
turned in to the Finance Department as soon as possible after the item or items
are received with the receiving date clearly marked.
      (2)   Change orders to regular purchase orders. After a regular purchase
order is issued to the vendor, it may become necessary to change it to include
additional quantities, shipping costs, and the like. When this occurs, the
employee who completed the original requisition shall process another
requisition for the change order. The employee shall note the original purchase
order number for which the change is being made and explain briefly the need
for the change. Please note that change orders to original contracts of $25,000
or more require the prior approval of either the City Manager or City Council.
For more information, please refer to the financial policy on change orders
included in this manual.
      (3)   Confirming purchase orders. Except in the case of emergency
purchase orders, the city will not issue confirming purchase orders to vendors.
      (4)   Prepayments. The city will not pay for goods and services until the
goods are received or the service is rendered. Exceptions:
         (a)   Deposits on certain jobs when approved by the Director of
Finance or City Manager;
         (b)   Memberships and books or periodicals;
         (c)   Payments to local, state, and federal government entities;
         (d)   Service and maintenance contracts where necessary;
         (e)   Small orders (under $1,500) where the department director
approves prepayment; and
         (f)   Approval by the Director of Finance or City Manager.
      (5)   Manual checks.
         (a)   Manual checks are interim checks issued to vendors as payments
for goods delivered or services performed. The checks are issued between normal
accounts payable cycles when an emergency or other extenuating circumstance as
determined by the Finance Department makes it impractical or unreasonable to
process the payment following normal payment methods. As the name implies,
manual checks are labor intensive and time consuming to issue, therefore, their
use as a method of payment shall be restricted to unique or special
circumstances.
         (b)   All requests for manual checks must be processed by completing a
purchase requisition form. The completed form shall include the vendor's name
and address, the account number against which it is being charged, a
description of the item purchased, and an explanation as to need for the check.
The form shall also include the signature of the applicable department
director. Completed forms shall be submitted to the Finance Department for
approval.
      (6)   Petty cash.
         (a)   This policy sets forth procedures for the handling of petty cash
monies city-wide. It further establishes the procedures for reporting petty
cash disbursements by department to the Department of Finance as well as
reimbursements to each petty cash box. Each location's department director is
responsible for seeing that the total number of receipts and cash equal the
amounts detailed in division (E)(2) above. The petty cash box is subject to
audit and the department director will be accountable for any non-compliance
with this procedure or shortage of funds.
         (b)   All forms needed in order to effectively manage the petty cash
process are referred to in the procedures section and are contained as exhibits
to this policy.
         (c)   The following policy and procedural guidelines have been
established to promote a more efficient and accountable petty cash operation.
All departments within the city are responsible for abiding by this policy.
There are no exceptions.
            1.   Petty cash disbursements to employees.
               a.   Requests for petty cash may be made to the office manager
at each location or Accounts Payable Clerk at City Hall.
               b.   There is a $75 limit per petty cash request per employee
per day. Any amount above $75 must be submitted through the accounts payable
process.
               c.   No one is allowed to take money from petty cash without a
petty cash request form and a cash receipt which must be signed by the
appropriate supervisor. The petty cash request form must also be signed by the
employee who will receive the money.
                  i.   If a petty cash request form is submitted without a
receipt, the employee must bring back a receipt before they are reimbursed. If
for some reason the employee did not obtain a receipt for submittal with the
petty cash request form, supervisory approval MUST be noted on the petty cash
receipt form.
                  ii.   All receipts must be original. If desired, copies may
be made and kept by each individual employee, but the original must be given to
the respective person responsible for petty cash in each department.
               d.   All petty cash request forms must contain the following
information:
                  i.   Date;
                  ii.   Detailed description of the expenditure;
                  iii.   Name of person(s) to receive money;
                  iv.   Department; and
                  v.   Receipt signed by the supervisor.
            2.   Reimbursing each petty cash box.
               a.   The person responsible for the petty cash shall not only
disburse petty cash to various employees, they must reconcile the petty cash
box and request petty cash reimbursements by the payables deadline. It is
recommended that this be done on a bi-weekly basis, as needed.
               b.   The maximum amount of petty cash allotted at City Hall is
$1,000. If this amount is not sufficient to meet the needs of the department,
the department director can request an increase in the petty cash allotment.
This request must be approved by the Director of Finance.
               c.   Petty cash will be subject to periodic announced and
unannounced audits to determine compliance with these procedures. Any
discrepancies with compliance or cash balance shall be immediately reported to
the Director of Finance and a written report shall be provided with copies to
the City Manager and department director.
               d.   Any questions regarding these procedures may be directed to
the Finance Department at City Hall.
      (7)   Credit card payments.
         (a)   The City Council has provided each department director and
various supervisory staff with a corporate credit card for use in making
purchases. Each cardholder is responsible for the security of the card and
should not permit its use for means other than those permitted by this policy.
Credit card use shall be limited to the purchase of items under $5,000
(excluding payment of travel expenses) where a purchase order cannot be used
(e.g. airline reservations, restaurants and the like). Credit card purchases of
$5,000 or more must be approved by the Finance Director or City Manager. Credit
cards shall not be used to circumvent the normal payment process.
         (b)   As with all purchases made on the city's behalf, goods purchased
with a credit card are exempt from sales tax. Therefore, employees shall
provide the vendor with a sales tax exemption form in order to avoid being
charged sales tax.
         (c)   Receipts for goods or services, or printout of orders placed on
line, purchased with a credit card shall be obtained and submitted to accounts
payable by the end of the billing cycle. If a receipt is not issued, a packing
slip may be provided to accounts payable. Payment will not be made unless
receipts (or an explanation as to why receipts are not available) are included
with the credit card statement. It is not permitted to utilize the credit card
for personal purchases at any time.
         (d)   The Finance Department shall maintain a list of the credit cards
issued to each employee/department and shall request that they be returned
prior to termination of employment. Returned cards shall be forwarded to the
Director of Finance or his/her designee and shall be canceled.
      (8)   Accounts payable (purchases made without purchase orders).
         (a)   Purchase orders are the preferred method of payment for most
city transactions. However, in the following instances, payments will be made
without purchase orders, after approval from the department director or
supervisor:
            1.   Recurring monthly bills (i.e. phone bills, utility bills, and
the like);
            2.   Credit card payments; and
            3.   Reimbursements to city employees for expenses incurred.
         (b)   The city will make every effort to pay invoices in a timely
manner in order to receive any discounts available.
         (c)   Purchases made pursuant to contracts and/or professional
services will not require purchase requisition forms or purchase orders.
      (9)   Local vendors. Any items purchased from a local vendor may be
charged to the city account with the vendor giving the employee a copy of the
ticket for the item purchased (some places do not give tickets). The employee
will need to put an account number on the ticket, sign it clearly, and submit
it to the supervisor. The supervisor shall signify approval with initials,
indicate account number, and submit it to the appropriate departmental payable
processing staff or Finance Department. Accounts payable processing staff will
match the tickets with the statement and set them up for payment. A listing of
local vendors utilized can be obtained from the Finance Department.
   (F)   Miscellaneous purchasing policies and guidelines.
      (1)   Change order policy.
         (a)   This policy requires City Council approval of all change orders
for $25,000 or more and for all change orders which, when combined with those
previously approved, increase or reduce the contract price by more than
$25,000.
         (b)   Change orders which increase or reduce the time for completion
of the contract by more than 180 days (regardless of the original contract
price) require City Council approval. In these instances, departments shall
follow the procedures for submitting change orders to the City Council outlined
above.
         (c)   It shall be the responsibility of each department director to
ensure that all change orders are submitted to the City Manager or City Council
for approval. In addition, department directors shall be responsible for
monitoring all contract payouts and retainages and ensuring that the amount of
the change order is correct.
         (d)   Changes to professional service contracts (e.g. engineering,
architectural or land surveying work) shall be treated as contract amendments.
         (e)   Procedures for submitting change orders to the City Council.
            1.   Change orders requiring City Council approval shall be placed
on the City Council's agenda and shall be accompanied by a memorandum
explaining the need for the contract revision. If a change order for less than
$25,000 is submitted to the City Council for approval, departments shall
explain that City Council approval is necessary because the total value of all
change orders exceeds $25,000.
            2.   Change orders shall be numbered sequentially and shall bear
the signature of the department director. In instances where a final balancing
change order (regardless of the amount) reduces the contract price, departments
shall instruct Finance to close out the remaining encumbered funds.
            3.   In special circumstances, a change order requiring City
Council approval may be authorized by the City Manager or his/her designee
prior to being placed on the City Council agenda. After receiving
authorization, however, the department, following the requirements outlined
above, shall have the change order placed on the City Council's agenda for the
following meeting.
      (2)   Fixed asset policy.
         (a)   A fixed asset policy is herein established to insure compliance
with governmental financial reporting standards and to safeguard city assets.
         (b)   Fixed assets shall include land, buildings, machinery, equipment
and vehicles with a life expectancy of one year or more. To be included in this
definition, the capitalization threshold of the asset or minimum value of the
asset at the time of acquisition is established at $20,000.
         (c)   Responsibility for control of fixed assets rests with the
operating department wherein the asset is located. The Director of Finance
shall ensure that such control is being maintained by establishing a fixed
asset inventmy that is updated on a regular basis and which documents all
additions and deletions to the fixed asset inventory. Operating departments
shall report the disposal or relocation of a fixed asset promptly to the
Director of Finance or his/her designee.
         (d)   Assets acquired during the year shall be recorded as an
expenditure against the appropriate capital expenditure account. In the
comprehensive annual financial report, these expenses are depreciated over the
useful life of the asset.
         (e)   Assets shall be recorded in the fixed asset inventory by using
an appropriate description and by recording serial numbers where applicable.
Tagging of all assets will not be required. Assets not capitalized under this
policy but which, in the opinion of the Director of Finance may, in the
aggregate, account for a substantial asset group, shall be inventoried by the
appropriate operating department by a means or system suitable for maintaining
control of the assets. The Director of Finance shall determine the appropriate
means or system to be used in these situations.
      (3)   Disposal of city property (not real property).
         (a)   City property of value may not be sold or traded without prior
approval of the City Council.
         (b)   If the item has value, notify the Finance Department to
determine if the item needs to be removed from the city's records. Include
information such as identifying the equipment to be disposed, the name of the
manufacturer, model number, serial number, and an estimate of salvage value if
applicable. The Finance Department is authorized to transfer usable surplus
materials to another department requesting such materials, or to approve
disposal of the property where appropriate. The department director shall have
the City Attorney prepare an ordinance for the City Council agenda recommending
disposal of the property.
      (4)   Purchases near the end of the fiscal year. When purchases are made
near the end of the fiscal year (i.e. April 30), departments shall be
responsible for ensuring that they are expensed (i.e. charged) against the
fiscal year in which they were received. The date goods are received or
services are performed determines which fiscal year they are expensed against.
Consequently, goods and services will be expensed in the current fiscal year
only if they are received or performed by April 30. This is true regardless of
when the purchase requisition is processed or the purchase order is issued.
Items not received by April 30 will be expensed in the next fiscal year.
      (5)   Use of sales tax exemption number.
         (a)   Use by employees.
            1.   City purchases are not subject to sales tax; therefore,
employees shall make efforts to inform vendors of the city's tax-exempt status
and to ensure that sales tax is not paid for purchases made with petty cash or
credit cards. Sales tax exemption forms may be obtained from the Finance
Department.
            2.   Use of the city's sales tax exemption number is restricted to
purchases made on behalf of the city. State law prohibits use of the city's
sales tax exemption number to secure exemptions for personal reasons and such
use will subject the responsible individual and all guilty parties to a fine of
not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for not more than five years or both,
together with costs of prosecutions.
         (b)   Use by outside contractors or vendors.
            1.   The Illinois Department of Revenue regulations allow
contractors to use the city's sales tax exemption number to purchase materials
used in construction of public improvements which will be eventually dedicated
to the city. Use of the exemption number is limited to purchases directly
related to work being done on behalf of the city. Contractors are responsible
for any tax due on purchases determined to be non-exempt and for purchases not
made on the city's behalf.
            2.   Requests by contractors for the city's sales tax exemption
number shall be forwarded to the Director of Finance or his/her designee. The
city will provide a letter of explanation regarding the correct use of the
city's tax-exempt number along with a sales tax exemption certificate. It is
the responsibility of the contractor to properly account for the use of the
city's tax exemption number. The City of Wood River reserves the right to audit
purchases to assure compliance with the terms and conditions governing use in
accordance with Illinois law.

(Ord. 24-9, passed 2-20-2024)
IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM
§ 37.35 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This program is designed to identify and address the warning signs
that indicate potential identity theft in order to prevent the misappropriation
of identifying information (as defined herein) in connection with the opening
and maintenance of certain utility accounts.
   (B)   The utility has developed the program to comply with the Federal Trade
Commission’s (FTC) Red Flag Rules, implemented under § 114 of the Fair and
Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003, pursuant to 16 C.F.R. § 681.2.
   (C)   The Department analyzed the utility’s billing practices and concluded
the utility maintains covered account (as defined in the Red Flag Rules) and,
consequently, must implement a written program to comply with the Red Flag
Rules.
(Prior Code, § 37.30) (Ord. 09-02, passed 4-20-2009)
§ 37.36 DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION.
   This Program was developed with the oversight and approval of the Utility
Department and shall be implemented by the City Hall staff. After consideration
of the size and complexity of the utility’s operations and account systems, and
the nature and scope of the utility’s activities, the Department determined
that this program appropriately satisfies the utility’s obligations under the
Red Flag Rules and therefore approved this Program on April 20, 2009.
(Prior Code, § 37.31) (Ord. 09-02, passed 4-20-2009)
§ 37.37 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCOUNT or COVERED ACCOUNT.
      (1)   A continuing relationship the utility has with an individual
through an account the utility offers or maintains primarily for business,
personal, family, or household purposes, that involves multiple payments of
transactions; and
      (2)   Any other account the utility offers or maintains for which there
is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of
the utility from identity theft.

taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a
credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorize by this section to the
extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state

such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the

collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.

a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this subchapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The

person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an

person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

this subchapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence
shall not affect other provisions of this subchapter, or their application,
that can be given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or
its application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of
such provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this subchapter.

connecting to the city sewer system;
         (b)   Multi-family units shall be charged $750 for the first unit plus
$150 for each additional unit as a tapping fee for connecting to the city sewer
system; and
         (c)   Commercial and industrial units shall be charged $3,000 for one
six-inch tap and $1,500 for each additional six-inch tap that may be required,
as a tapping fee.
   (D)   A building sewer permit will only be issued and a sewer connection
shall only be allowed if it can be demonstrated that the downstream sewage
facilities, including sewers, pump stations and wastewater treatment
facilities, have sufficient reserve capacity to adequately and efficiently
handle the additional anticipated waste load.

the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the
city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by
the installation of the bolding sewer.
   (F)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the
building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and
the whole considered as one building sewer.
   (G)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Director of Public
Services, to meet all requirements of this chapter.

Construction in Illinois shall apply. All such connections shall be made gas-
tight and water-tight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the Director of Public Services before
installation.
   (I)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by a means which is
approved in accordance with §
51.010(B), and discharged to the building sewer.
   (J)   No persons shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected
directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
   (K)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Director
of Public Services when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of the Director of Public Services or his or her representative.
   (L)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights provided by the property owner or person
having work performed so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the
work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
   (M)   The expense for cleaning, maintaining, or repairing building sewers of
any private property owners to the city sewer system, or the cleaning,
maintaining, or repairing of any private sewer, not heretofore or hereafter
accepted by the city, shall be borne by the property owner or person having
such work performed.

upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.

WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 51.065 BASIC DATA FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   The user charge system as hereinafter set forth has been developed from data
outlined in the report by Gonzalez Companies, LLC, St. Louis, Missouri, dated
January, 2016, entitled “Wood River Sewer Rate Study”, said report being
incorporated by reference and which shall constitute the basis for determining
domestic and industrial user charges.
(Prior Code, § 51.075) (Ord 88-9, passed 9-20-1988; Ord. 16-06, passed 3-7-
2016)
§ 51.066 COMPUTATION OF WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The wastewater service charges for the use of and for the service
supplied by the wastewater facilities of the Wood River Regional System shall
consist of:
      (1)   A basic user charge to pay certain expenses of the system which are
not related to usage (administration);
      (2)   A basic user rate to pay expenses of said operation, maintenance,
and replacement costs;
      (3)   A debt service rate to pay the capital costs associated with
construction, as outlined in the intergovernmental agreements;
      (4)   The report, “Wood River Sewer Rate Study”, combines the basic user
rate and debt service rate into one item. If need be, these rates can be
separated; and
      (5)   A surcharge, if applicable.
   (B)   A separate rate shall be computed for the City of Wood River and Wood
River Township to include the costs attributable to the sewage collection
system and the preliminary treatment units of the Regional Treatment Plant.
   (C)   A separate rate shall be computed for the Village of Roxana to exclude
all costs except those attributable to sludge handling and administration.
   (D)   The method of computing said separate rates for the City of Wood
River, Wood River Township, and Village of Roxana, is outlined in the report
hereinabove noted.
   (E)   (1)   Basic user charge for Wood River Regional System shall be
computed by allocating the administrative expense equally among all users
connected to the Regional Treatment Facility. The allocation is made by
dividing the total annual amount of administrative expense by the product of
the number of users served by the system multiplied by the number of billings
per year per user to determine the monthly basic user charge.
      (2)   The basic user charge for Hartford, Roxana, Amoco, and Wood River
Township shall consist of the equal division of administrative expense only and
for this purpose, each entity shall be considered as one billable user.
   (F)   Basic user rate shall be based on water usage as recorded by water
meters and/or sewage flow meters and shall be assessed for the purpose of
paying the cost of operation, maintenance and replacement expense. The basic
user rate will be applicable for normal or below normal strength sewage.
      (1)   Normal strength sewage is determined to have the following
characteristics:
         (a)   A five-day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 204 mg/l;
and
         (b)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 mg/l.
      (2)   It shall consist of operation, maintenance, and replacement expense
and shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including equipment replacement;
         (b)   Estimate the billable wastewater volume; and
         (c)   Compute cost per thousand gallons of billable volume.
   (G)   The debt service rate shall be based on the reserve capacity of the
Regional Treatment Plant for wastewater flows from Hartford and Wood River
Township, as outlined in the intergovernmental agreement between the City of
Wood River and Wood River Township and the City of Wood River and the Village
of Hartford.
      (1)   The City of Wood River and Village of Roxana have an agreement
which provides for dewatering and disposal of Roxana’s wastewater treatment
plant sludge. The debt service rate for Roxana will be based on its
proportionate use of the sludge handling facilities.
      (2)   The intergovernmental agreements provide for two options: a lump
sum payment; or 20 annual equal payments together with interest on the unpaid
balance at the rate of 7% per annum. The basis of development is detailed in
the report hereinabove noted in §
51.065.
   (H)   A surcharge in addition to the above mentioned charges will be
assessed all users whose discharges exceed the normal concentrations for BOD
(204 mg/l) and SS (240 mg/l). The surcharge will be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed those
concentrations. Section 51.070 specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
      (1)   The unit rate for BOD and SS surcharge calculations shall be
computed as follows:
         (a)   Proportion the estimated annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including the Equipment Replacement Fund,
to the major plant categories;
         (b)   Proportion the costs of the major plant categories to “volume”,
BOD and SS;
         (c)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of BOD and pounds of SS to be
treated; and
         (d)   Compute the unit cost per 1,000 gallons and per pound of BOD and
SS based on average strength waste.
      (2)   (a)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be
reviewed annually, by certified public accounts to City of Wood River in their
annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised
periodically to reflect a change in capital costs or a change in the number of
users and in operation and maintenance costs including equipment replacement
costs.
         (b)   The purpose of annual review is to assure that each user through
the wastewater service charge pays a proportionate share of operation and
maintenance, including debt service, and to maintain proportionality of the
user charge system.
      (3)   Amoco Chemical Corporation shall be assessed a surcharge amount
when discharges exceed the normal concentrations. This surcharge will be based
upon identified actual costs which exceed the normal operating costs for design
loadings. These extra costs will be identified on a detailed cost breakdown and
assessed on a monthly basis.
(Prior Code, § 51.076) (Ord. 88-9, passed 9-20-1988)
§ 51.067 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of
1,000 gallons.
   (A)   If the person or other dischargers (industrial, commercial, or the
like), discharging wastes into the public sewers procure any part, or all, of
their water from the sources other than the public waterworks system, all or a
part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the discharger shall, if
directed by the city, install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters
of a type approved by the Manager for the purpose of determining the volume of
water obtained from these other sources.
   (B)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharge may be required by
the Manager if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
   (C)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the
Manager.

§ 51.069 SURCHARGE RATE.
   (A)   In the event use of the wastewater facilities by nonresidential users
is determined by the Manager to include wastes in addition to normal strength
domestic waste, the user shall pay a surcharge cost in addition to the basic
user charge, the basic user rate and the debt service rate.
   (B)   The rates of surcharge for BOD and SS shall be as follows:
      (1)   For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD): $0.13 per pound BOD; and
      (2)   For suspended solids (SS): $0.22 per pound SS.
(Prior Code, § 51.079) (Ord. 88-9, passed 9-20-1988; Ord. 92-4, passed 4-27-
1992; Ord. 96-8, passed 4-15-1996; Ord. 97-2, passed 1-6-1997)
§ 51.070 COMPUTATION OF SURCHARGE.
   (A)   The surcharge per user shall be computed by the following formula:
         S - V(0.00834) [A(BOD-204) + B(SS-240)]
   Where:   S = Amount of Surcharge ($)
   V = Wastewater Volume in 1,000 gallons per billing period
   (0.008340) = Unit weight of water x 10-6 per 1,000 gallon
   A = Unit charge for BODS per lb., $0.13
   BODS - five-day biochemical oxygen demand, mg/l (no less than 204 mg/l)
   204 = Allowable BODS strength
   B = Unit charge for SS per lb., $0.10
   SS = Total Suspended Solids, mg/l (no less than 240 mg/l)
   240 = Allowable SS, mg/l
   (B)   The concentration of wastes discharged in excess of normal strength
wastes shall be used for computing surcharges and shall be established by
sewage flow metering and waste sampling. Waste sampling and testing by an
approved laboratory shall be completed by the discharger as often as may be
deemed necessary by the Manager and shall be binding as a basis for surcharge.
(Prior Code, § 51.080) (Ord. 88-9, passed 9-20-1988)
§ 51.071 COMPUTATION FORMULA, GENERALLY.
   The wastewater service charge per user shall be computed by the following
formula:
         W = M + (V) (r+d) + S
   Where:   W = Amount of wastewater service charge ($) per billing period
   M = Minimum basic user charge for administrative costs
   V = Wastewater Volume in 1,000 gallons per billing period
   r = Basic User Rate for operation, maintenance, and replacement in ($) per
1,000 gallons, except for the Village of Roxana which is detailed in § 51.072
   d = Debt of Service Rate in ($) per 1,000 gallons, for the City of Wood
River and Wood River Township. For Village of Hartford and Village of Roxana,
the Debt Service Rate is not applicable. However, an annual payment is required
for Hartford, Roxana and Wood River Township.
(Prior Code, § 51.081) (Ord. 88-9, passed 9-20-1988)
§ 51.072 COMPUTATION FORMULA FOR VILLAGE OF ROXANA.
   The wastewater service charge for the Village of Roxana is for handling
sludge only and shall be computed by the following rule:
         W = M + V(0.00834)B(SS)
      Where:   W = Amount of wastewater service charge ($) per billing period
   M = Minimum basic user charge for administration costs
   V = Wastewater Volume in 1,000 gallons per billing period
   (0.00834) = Unit Weight of Water x 10-6 per 1,000 gallons
   B = Unit Charge for SS per lb., $0.21
   SS = Total Suspended Solids, mg/l

§ 51.106 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Each industrial user having the ability to cause interference with the
POTW treatment plant or to violate the regulatory provisions of this chapter
shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the owner or user’s own cost and expense.
   (B)   All industrial users whose wastewater included or could include
compatible or incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause
interference with the POTW must have detailed plans on file at the POTW showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide protection from accidental
discharge. No industrial user who begins contributing to or could contribute
such pollutants to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall be
permitted to introduce such pollutants into the POTW until accidental discharge
facilities and procedures, as appropriate, have been approved by the city and
installed by the industrial user within one year from the date of approval.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an accidental or deliberate discharge of
compatible or incompatible pollutants which may cause interference at the POTW
or will pass through the POTW or violate requirements of this chapter, it shall
be the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and
notify the city of the incident.
      (2)   The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location
and time of discharge, type of wastewater, concentration, and volume.
   (D)   (1)   Within 15 days following such an accidental or deliberate
discharge, the industrial user shall submit to the city a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences.
      (2)   Followup reports may be required by the city as needed. Such
report, or reports, shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which incurred as a result of damage to the POTW,
fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such report
relieve the user of many fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may
be imposed by this chapter or otherwise.
      (3)   Failure to report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in
addition to any other remedies available to the POTW, result in the revocation
of the discharger’s wastewater discharge permit.
   (E)   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (F)   (1)   A notice in English and the language of common use shall be
permanently posted on the industrial user’s bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental or illegal
discharge.
      (2)   Employers shall ensure that all employees who are in a position to
cause, discover, or observe such discharge are advised of the emergency
notification procedures.

facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, in order to evaluate compliance with the
national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user shall measure
the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e). Where an alternate concentration has
been calculated in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e), this adjusted limit
along with supporting data shall be submitted to the city;
            5.   Perform sampling and analysis in accordance with Standard
Methods;
            6.   Submit, only with city authorization, a baseline report which
utilizes only historical data, so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; and
            7.   Provide for each report, the time, date, and place of sampling
and methods of analysis and certification that such sampling and analysis is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
POTW.
         (f)   The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether national categorical pretreatment standards
are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation
and maintenance measures (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required for the
industrial user to meet the national categorical pretreatment standards;
         (g)   If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the
national categorical pretreatment standards, the industrial user will provide
the shortest schedule which will provide such additional pretreatment or O&M.
The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard.
            1.   Where the industrial user’s national categorical pretreatment
standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 C.F.R. § 403.7) or the
combined waste stream formula (40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e)), or net/gross calculations
(40 C.F.R. § 403.15), at the time the industrial user submits a baseline report
the information required in divisions (A)(4)(f) and (A)(4)(g) of this section
shall pertain to the modified limits.
            2.   If the national categorical pretreatment standard for the
industrial user is modified after the baseline report is submitted, the
industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as
a response to divisions (A)(4)(f) and (A)(4)(g) of this section and submit them
to the city within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.
         (h)   The following conditions shall apply to any schedule submitted
in response to division (A)(4)(g) of this section:
            1.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring
an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing
contract for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction, and the like);
            2.   No increment referred to in division (A)(4)(h)1. above shall
exceed nine months; and
            3.   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
city including, at a minimum, whether or not it has complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps
being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the POTW.
   (B)   Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new
source, within 45 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards shall
submit to the city a report, on forms provided by the city, indicating the
nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
process which are limited by pretreatment standards and the average and maximum
daily flow for these process units in the user’s facility which are limited by
such pretreatment standards. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional user operation and maintenance or pretreatment techniques or
installations are necessary to bring the user into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a
qualified professional.
   (C)   Periodic compliance reports for all significant industrial users.
      (1)   All significant industrial users subject to an applicable
pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such applicable
pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source, after discharge of
wastewater to the POTW begins, shall submit to the POTW during the months of
June and December for the preceding two calendar quarters, a certified report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by such applicable pretreatment standards. In addition, this report
shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows
for the reporting period.
      (2)   At the discretion of the city, the wastewater discharge permittee
shall sample, analyze, and report to the city pollutants set forth in its
wastewater discharge permit.
      (3)   At the discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors
as a local high or low flow rate, holidays, or budget cycles, the city may
agree to alter the months during which the above reports are submitted.
      (4)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
wastewater to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with Standard Methods.

§ 51.124 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (A)   The city shall require to be provided and operated at the significant
industrial user’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage
systems. The monitoring facility will normally be situated on the user’s
premises but the city may, when such a location would be impractical and cause
undue hardship to the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activities of the user.
   (B)   Where required by the city, additional control manholes or sampling
chambers shall be provided at the end of each industrial process within an
industrial user’s facility suitable for the determination of compliance with
pretreatment standards.
   (C)   Whenever required by a wastewater discharge permit, any significant
industrial user shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber for each
separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with plans and
specifications approved by the city, installed and maintained at all times at
the user’s expense, which shall have ample room in each sampling chamber to
permit the city to take accurate composite samples for analysis. The chamber
shall be safely, easily, and independently accessible to authorized
representatives of the city at any time.
      (1)   Each sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus flume unless a
weir or similar device is approved by the POTW with a recording and totalizing
register for measurement of the liquid quantity; or at the discretion of the
city the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as the liquid
quantity where it is substantiated to the city that the metered water supply
and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable
adjustment agreed to by the city is made in the metered water supply to
determine the liquid waste quantity.
      (2)   When required, samples shall be taken every hour or half hour, as
determined by the city, and properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance
with Standard Methods and shall be composited in proportion to the flow for a
representative 24-hour sample. Such sampling shall be done as prescribed by the
user’s wastewater discharge permit.
      (3)   The sampling chamber, metering device, and documentation of the
frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analyses of samples shall be
subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection and verification by the city.
   (D)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with Standard Methods.

records are kept shall allow the city or its representative ready access upon
presentation of credentials at reasonable times to all parts of said premises
for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination, and photocopying of
records required to be kept by this chapter, and in the performance of any of
their duties. The city shall have the right to set up on the industrial user’s
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, monitoring and
metering operations. Where an industrial user has security measures in force
which could require suitable identification, necessary arrangements with their
security guards shall be made so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city shall be permitted to enter immediately
for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Such
arrangements shall be made by all industrial users with their security guards
within 30 days of the passage of this chapter.
   (B)   Industrial users and the city shall maintain records of all
information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this chapter
and shall include:
      (1)   The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the names of
the person or persons taking the samples;
      (2)   The dates analyses were performed;
      (3)   Who performed the analyses;
      (4)   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
      (5)   The results of such analyses.
   (C)   (1)   The city and industrial users shall maintain such records for a

reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs
and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests,
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, and until such time
as the city determines that the requested information is not entitled to
confidential treatment, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental
agencies for uses related to this chapter, the national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) permit, and for use by the state or any state agency
in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person or
industrial user furnishing the report.
   (C)   Information and data provided to the city which is effluent data shall
be available to the public without restriction.
   (D)   Information claimed by an industrial user to be confidential shall not
be transmitted to the general public by the city until and unless a 30-day
notification is given to the industrial user.

applicable local regulations, and shall have inspections and tests made of such
approved devices upon installation and as required by the Illinois Plumbing
Code, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and local regulations.
   (B)   No person, firm, or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the city may enter the supply or distribution system of the
municipality, unless such private, auxiliary, or emergency water supply and the
method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
Director of Public Services and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Director of Public Services to cause
services and investigations to be made of commercial industrial, and other
properties served by the public water supply to determine whether actual or
potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys and
investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be repeated at
least every two years, and as often as the Director of Public Services shall
deem necessary. Records of such surveys shall be maintained and available for
review for a period of at least five years.
   (D)   The approved cross-connection control device inspector shall have the
right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to
the public water supply or distribution system of the city for the purpose of
verifying the presence or absence of cross-connections, and that the Director
of Public Services or his or her authorized agent shall have the right to enter
at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water
supply or distribution system of the city for the purpose of verifying
information submitted by the customer regarding the required cross-connection
control inspection. On demand the owner, lessees, or occupants of any property
so served shall furnish to the Director of Public Services any information
which he or she may request regarding the piping system or systems or water or
water use on such property. The refusal of such information when demanded,
shall, within the discretion of the Director of Public Services, be deemed
evidence of the presence of improper connections as provided in this
subchapter.
   (E)   The City Director of Public Services is hereby authorized and directed
to discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water
service to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions
of this subchapter is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary
measures as he or she may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water supply distribution mains. Water service to
such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been eliminated
or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter, and until a
reconnection fee of $60 is paid to the city. Immediate disconnection with
verbal notice can be effected when the Director of Public Services is assured
that imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water supply system
exists. Such action shall be followed by written notification of the cause of
disconnection. Immediate disconnection without notice to any party can be
effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of the
public water supply, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Director
of Public Services or the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, such action
is required to prevent actual or potential contamination or pollution of the
public water supply. Neither the public water supply, the Director of Public
Services, or its agents or assigns shall be liable to any customer for any
injury, damages, or lost revenues which may result from termination of said
customers water supply in accordance with the terms of this subchapter, whether
or not said termination was with or without notice.

the cost of clean-up of the potable water supply system.
   (G)   This subchapter shall take effect and be in force from and after
passage and approval by the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 52.06) (Ord. 91-5, passed 8-19-1991)
§ 52.021 PURPOSE; APPLICATION; POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these rules and regulations is:
      (1)   To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the customer’s water system, contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system;
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer’s potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable safety; and
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public and consumer’s potable water systems.
   (B)   Application. These rules and regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water supply system of the city.
   (C)   Policy. The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or back-siphonage of contaminants through the customer’s water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the Director of Public Services or his or
her authorized representative, an approved backflow prevention device is
necessary for the safety of the public water supply system, the Director of
Public Services shall give notice to the consumer to install such approved
backflow prevention device at each service connection to the premises. The
consumer shall immediately install such approved device or devices at his or
her own expense; failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the consumer to
install such device or devices immediately shall constitute grounds for
discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or devices have
been installed. The consumer shall retain records of installation, maintenance,
testing, and repair as required in §
52.029 below for a period of at least five years. The Director of Public
Services may require the consumer to submit a cross-connection inspection
report to the city to assist in determining whether or not service line
protection will be required. All cross-connection inspections shall be
conducted by a cross-connection control device inspector certified by the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.

continued until reletting of the premises. The owner shall agree to be
responsible for a $15 meter “read and leave on” plus water charges, and service
will be continued to the premises without the necessity of paying the $60
service fee.
      (2)   Transfer fee. A water customer may transfer one water service to
another water service, both within the city limits of Wood River, for payment
of all current bills and payment of a transfer fee of $15. Any such water

discontinuance of transfer of service to the applicant/customer, the Water
Division shall certify to the City Treasurer the status of the water account of
the applicant/customer. In the event such certification discloses that the
account is paid in full to the date of termination of service, the City
Treasurer shall issue a draft upon the Water Meter Deposit Fund in an amount
equal to the original deposit of the applicant, without interest, and shall
deliver same to the applicant/customer.

determines, the city shall have the authority to turn the matter over to a
collection agency. Whenever a bill for water service remains unpaid for 60
days, after it has been transmitted, the City Treasurer may file, with the
County Recorder of Deeds, a statement of lien claim. This statement shall
contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid
bills, and a notice that the city claims a lien for this amount, as well as for
all charges subsequent to the period covered by the bill. If the user whose
bill is unpaid, is not the owner of the premises, then the City Treasurer has
notice that the notice shall be transmitted to the owner of the premises. If
his or her address is known to the City Treasurer, whenever such bill remains
unpaid for a period of 30 days after it has been transmitted, the failure of
the City Treasurer to transmit such notice or failure of the owner to receive
such notice shall not affect the right to foreclosure the lien for unpaid
bills. The City Treasurer has the right and authority to both file a lien and
turn the account over to collection agency.

preceding a non-business day. There will be a $150 call out fee for such

§ 55.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities and facilities, by establishing uniform
standards to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without
limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways, and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased storm water run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the city.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license, or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
chapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements;
telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license, or similar agreement between the city and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the city so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city
to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety,
and welfare.

(Prior Code, § 55.04)
§ 55.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (A)   City review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the City Director
of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does
not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the City Director of Public Works shall reject such
application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the City Director of
Public Works is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements
of this chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations,
the City Director of Public Works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as
practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the City Director of Public Works, that the
construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with
the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to § 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it intends to commence
work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the city not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work
requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of
work requiring excavation. The City Director of Public Works shall specify the
portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used, and
constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the City Director of Public Works fails to
provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either:
         (a)   Ten days after service of notice to the city by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction; or
         (b)   Twenty-five days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
55.04 the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city an application
for a permit and any and all plans, specifications, and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of division (A) above.
   (C)   Additional city review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007, being 220 ILCS 5/21-100 et seq., shall be
deemed granted 45 days after submission to the city, unless otherwise acted
upon by the city, provided the holder has complied with applicable city codes,
ordinances, and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 55.05)
§ 55.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time, and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 55.06)
§ 55.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings, and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
55.20. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall
either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that
it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
(Prior Code, § 55.07)
§ 55.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the city, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) below:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as “X”, “C”, and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each
person;
            2.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any
one accident; and
            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of liability.
         (b)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles
with a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property
damage for each accident;
         (c)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
         (d)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (2)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the city,
by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice addressed to the City Manager of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no
event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) above. A
utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds
under division (A) above, or the requirements of divisions (B), (C), and (D)
above. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) above, such as
evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer” under the Workers
Compensation Act, being 820 ILCS 305/1.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self- insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state. (All insurance
carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-” or better and of a class
size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.)
(Prior Code, § 55.08)
§ 55.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless, or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Prior Code, § 55.09)

to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this section.
      (1)   No interference with city facilities. No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the City Director of Public Works determines that
the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
city’s utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the city’s utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of- way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-grounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of city highways may
require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or
additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC’s
rules entitled, “Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines” (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
         (b)   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way
line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         (b)   Capacity for the utility’s foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The city may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. § 192.707).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The city may
require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are not
highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The city may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right- of-way.
      (2)   The city may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The city may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular
locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to

does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
(Prior Code, § 55.14)
§ 55.15 CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS.
   (A)   Standards and requirements for particular types of construction
methods.
      (1)   Boring or jacking.
         (a)   Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the City
Director of Public Works from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or
jacking shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of boring or
jacking operations and backfilled within 48 hours after boring or jacking
operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and
protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced,
and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads
that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
         (b)   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         (c)   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over six
inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and following
pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside diameter of
the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).
         (d)   Borings with diameters six inches or less. Borings of six inches
or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking, guided with auger,
or auger and following pipe method.
         (e)   Tree preservation. Any facility located within the drip line of
any tree designated by the city to be preserved or protected shall be bored
under or around the root system.
      (2)   Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair, or
maintenance on rights-of- way shall be done in accord with the applicable
portions of § 603 of IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction”.
         (a)   Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to the
practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the City Director of Public Works.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the city to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction”. When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         (b)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Director of Public Works, the utility, at its expense, shall
remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed facility,
place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new pavement,
sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by the
Director of Public Works.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division (A)(4)
is permitted under §
55.20, the following requirements shall apply.
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Director of Public Works.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the city.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
city.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or city approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the city. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided
and maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for
minimum cover for the type of facility:
 
Type of Facility                      Minimum Cover

overhead or underground facilities, when permitted within a right-of-way, shall
be provided with a vegetation-free area extending one foot (305 mm) in width
beyond the appurtenance in all directions. The vegetation-free area may be
provided by an extension of the mounting pad, or by heavy duty plastic or
similar material approved by the Director of Public Works. With the approval of
the Director of Public Works, shrubbery surrounding the appurtenance may be
used in place of vegetation-free area. The housing for ground-mounted
appurtenances shall be painted a neutral color to blend with the surroundings.
   (C)   Materials.
      (1)   General standards. The materials used in constructing facilities
within rights-of-way shall be those meeting the accepted standards of the
appropriate industry, the applicable portions of IDOT’s “Standards
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction”, the requirements of the
Illinois Commerce Commission, or the standards established by other official
regulatory agencies for the appropriate industry.
      (2)   Material storage on right-of-way. No material shall be stored on
the right-of-way without the prior written approval of the City Director of
Public Works. When such storage is permitted, all pipe, conduit, wire, poles,
cross arms, or other materials shall be distributed along the right-of-way
prior to and during installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the public
or an obstacle to right-of-way maintenance or damage to the right-of-way and

must be obtained from the city.
      (3)   Hazardous materials. The plans submitted by the utility to the city
shall identify any hazardous materials that may be involved in the construction
of the new facilities or removal of any existing facilities.
   (D)   Operational restrictions.
      (1)   Construction operations on rights-of-way may, at the discretion of
the city, be required to be discontinued when such operations would create
hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and welfare. Such operations
may also be required to be discontinued or restricted when conditions are such
that construction would result in extensive damage to the right-of-way or other
property.
      (2)   These restrictions may be waived by the Director of Public Works
when emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.
      (3)   Unless otherwise permitted by the city, the hours of construction
are those set forth in Chapter 94 of this code of ordinances.
   (E)   Location of existing facilities. Any utility proposing to construct
facilities in the city shall contact J.U.L.I.E. and ascertain the presence and
location of existing above-ground and underground facilities within the rights-
of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities. The city will make its permit
records available to a utility for the purpose of identifying possible
facilities. When notified of an excavation or when requested by the City or by
J.U.L.I.E., a utility shall locate and physically mark its underground
facilities within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, in accordance with
the Illinois Underground Facilities Damage Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et
seq.)
(Prior Code, § 55.15)

   (A)   Electric utilities - compliance with state laws and regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable state laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the city as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities - tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The city will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.
   (D)   Chemical use.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) below, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the city for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or
disease.
      (2)   Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Director of Public Works that such spraying is the only practicable
method of vegetation control.
(Prior Code, § 55.16)
§ 55.17 REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the city, a
utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change, or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change, or alteration, is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
city improvement in or upon, or the operations of the city in or upon, the
rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the city, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The city retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or
useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior
to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the city, the utility shall notify the city within 90 days.
Following receipt of such notice the city may direct the utility to remove all
or any portion of the facility if the City Director of Public Works determines
that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and
welfare. In the event that the city does not direct the utility that abandoned
the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the city, the
abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of
all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
(Prior Code, § 55.17)
§ 55.18 CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION.
   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the rights-of-
way are disturbed, damaged, or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by
the utility, all to the satisfaction of the city. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the City Director of Public Works. Such
cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading,
reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a
condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the
commencement of the project. The time period provided in this section may be
extended by the City Director of Public Works for good cause shown.
(Prior Code, § 55.18)
§ 55.19 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify
noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades, or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
City Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the city police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the city a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after
an emergency repair.
(Prior Code, § 55.19)
§ 55.20 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the City Director of
Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The City Director of Public Works shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The City Director of Public Works
may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations, or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the City Director of Public Works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision, or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the City
Director of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the
right to appeal to the City Council, or such other board or commission as it
may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
City Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision,
or determination. The City Council shall commence its consideration of the
appeal at the Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least
seven days after the filing of the appeal. The City Council shall timely decide
the appeal.
(Prior Code, § 55.20)
§ 55.22 ENFORCEMENT.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the city may have for enforcement of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 55.22)
§ 55.23 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof.
(Prior Code, § 55.23)
§ 55.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the city will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city’s costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

clear indication of the right-of-way assignment from their normal positions
approaching the intersection. The vehicle signals shall exhibit different
colored lights successively one at a time, or with arrows. The following colors
shall be used and said terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of
vehicles as follows.
   (A)   Green alone or “Go”. Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when
prohibited, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic shall yield the
right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Yellow or “Caution” when shown with or following the green or “Go”
signal.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at the intersection, but if such stop cannot be made in
safety, a vehicle may be driven cautiously through the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.
   (C)   Red alone or “Stop”.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point as may be indicated
by a clearly visible line and shall remain standing until green or “Go” is
shown alone.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless the
pedestrian can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (D)   Red with arrow; green arrow (steady). Vehicular traffic facing such
signal may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement
indicated by such arrow but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.
   (E)   Green arrow alone. Vehicular traffic facing the signal may enter the
intersection only to make the movement or movements indicated by the arrows,
but shall not interfere with other traffic or endanger pedestrians lawfully
within a crosswalk. This signal will normally be used only at intersections
where one-way street operation is involved.

indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or
marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

walk” interval. These special signals shall apply to pedestrians only to the
exclusion of any regular traffic-control signal or signals which may be present
at the same location.
   (A)   “Walk” interval. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the
highway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by
the drivers of all vehicles.
   (B)   “Don’t walk” interval. No pedestrian shall start to cross the highway
in the direction of such signals, but any pedestrian who has partially
completed their crossing on the “walk” interval of such signal shall proceed to
a sidewalk or safety island while the “don’t walk” interval of the signal is
showing.

imitation of or resembles an official traffic-control device or railroad sign
or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, nor shall any
person place, maintain, or display upon or in view of any highway any other
sign which hides from view or interferes with the movement of traffic or the
effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any railroad sign or signal, and
no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit upon
any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial
advertising, and the authorities having jurisdiction over said highways either

requirements before permit for construction or reconstruction shall be
permitted:
   (A)   Driveways for other than residential or dwelling house use shall be
constructed of portland cement concrete at least six inches in thickness.
Concrete shall be as specified by the Director of Public Services.
   (B)   Driveways for residential or dwelling house use shall be constructed
in a manner and of a material equal at least to that existing for the paving in
the public street adjacent thereto. Where concrete pavement exists in the
public street and bituminous surface is desired for the driveway, such surface
shall be permitted, provided it shall have a minimum depth of two inches
without any loose material on top and has a base of water-bound macadam at
least six inches thick and provided that a portland cement concrete apron not
less than three feet in width be constructed between the existing concrete
pavement and the proposed bituminous driveway surface.
   (C)   Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across a
sidewalk space, it shall conform to the sidewalk grade as established by the
Director of Public Services.
   (D)   Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across an
existing sidewalk, said sidewalk shall be removed and replaced with portland
cement concrete for the full width of the driveway and for a distance of at
least 12 inches on both sides of said walk. This portion shall be not less than
six inches in thickness and constructed in accordance with specifications on
file in the office of the Director of Public Services.
   (E)   Macadam, gravel, cinder, and other types of driveways, where permitted
herein, shall be not less than six inches thick, compacted depth.
   (F)   Where paving in the public street is of concrete, and a concrete
driveway is constructed, a one-inch bituminous pre-moulded expansion joint with
load transmission unit shall be placed approximately three feet from the edge
of the concrete paving and normal to the centerline of the driveway, in
accordance with sketches illustrating such construction on file with the
Director of Public Services.
   (G)   The width of the driveways for other than residential or dwelling
house use shall not exceed 30 feet at the outer or street edge of the sidewalk.
Where two or more adjoining driveways are provided for the same property, a
safety island of not less than ten feet at the outer or street side of the
sidewalk shall be provided. Not more than two such driveways shall be allowed
to any one owner for any one piece of property on any one street for each 100
feet of continuous frontage thereof.
   (H)   The width of the driveways for residential or dwelling house use shall
be 12 feet per bay or car space at the outer or street edge of the sidewalk.
   (I)   The width of the driveway opening at the curb line shall not exceed
the width of the driveway at the inner or property edge plus 20 feet, nor be
less than the width of the driveway at the inner or property edge of the
sidewalk, plus ten feet. In no instance should the radius be less than three
feet at curb corners, and this only when the driveway is flared; nor more than
ten feet when the driveway is at right angles to the street line. The
centerline of all driveways must be approximately at right angles to the curb
line of the pavement in the public street for a distance of at least ten feet
from said curb line.
   (J)   All driveways shall be so graded between the gutter and the sidewalk
that it will not be necessary to change the established grade of either and
will not elevate or depress any portion of either. No part of the driveway
shall extend beyond the curb line in such a manner as to change the grade of
the gutter or obstruct the free flow of water in the gutter. Where elevations
or depressions are necessary in the parkway strip between the curb and walk,
the parkway shall be graded on both sides of the driveway to a distance
sufficient to create a gradual ascent or descent. At no time shall the gradient
exceed one foot vertical to ten feet horizontal.
   (K)   Combined curb and gutter and separate curbing shall be entirely
removed for the full width of the driveway open at the curb line. If an
existing joint in the curb is within five feet of the end of the driveway
opening, the existing curbing shall be removed to said joint, otherwise the
combined curb and gutter shall be cut or curbing shall be separated, making a
neat edge truly at right angles to the edge of the pavement and truly vertical.
Integral curbing, which is that type placed with the pavement and molded as an
integral part of it, must be removed for the full depth from the top of the
curb to the bottom of the pavement. No combined curb and gutter, straight curb,
or integral curb shall be removed within five feet of a public crosswalk.
   (L)   Where driveways cross open ditches in the parkways, culverts shall be
installed. Said culverts shall be of such size and shall be constructed of such
material as determined by the Director of Public Services, depending on the
conditions existing. In no instance shall the size of opening be less than that
obtained by a 12-inch diameter pipe. The length of culvert shall be determined
by the following method. For ditch depths of two feet or less, the culvert
shall extend not less than five feet beyond both edges of the driveway where it
crosses the ditch. For each additional foot depth of ditch, add two feet to the
above figure, except that no culvert shall be less than 20 feet long and except
that where headwalls are constructed at the ends of the culvert, the length
shall be as determined by the Director of Public Services.
   (M)   Where existing meter pits are in the area of a proposed driveway, the
existing cast iron top shall be removed and turned in to the Water Department.
A heavier cover shall be furnished and set by the Water Department, and the
additional cost thereof shall be paid by the contractor.
   (N)   Where an existing catch basin is in the area of the proposed driveway,
the tops shall be removed and replaced with a manhole top with perforated lid.
Said top shall be set by the Street Department and the additional cost thereof
shall be paid by the contractor.
   (O)   All driveways constructed or reconstructed over, across, or upon any
public street or public parkway in the city shall be kept and maintained at all
times in accordance with the provisions hereof by the persons so constructing,
reconstructing, or using the same as an adjunct or appurtenance to lands or
properties immediately adjacent thereto.

         (b)   An application shall be deemed complete if the city fails to
provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents,
information and fees specifically enumerated in the city’s permit application
form are submitted by the applicant to the city.
         (c)   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the city sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the city;
or
         (b)   A local, state, or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated applications.
         (a)   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities
within the jurisdiction of the city shall be allowed, at the applicant’s
discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
         (b)   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the city may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The city may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits.
         (a)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
city makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified
utility pole do not comply with the applicable city codes or any provision,
condition, or requirement contained in this chapter.
         (b)   If the Act is repealed as provided in § 90 therein, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the applicable city code provisions or regulations
in effect at the time of renewal.
      (7)   Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the city by personal
delivery at the city’s designated place of business, by regular mail postmarked
on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including electronic mail.
   (B)   Collocation requirements and conditions.
      (1)   Public safety space reservation. The city may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the city’s electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the city reasonably determines
that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      (2)   Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair, and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition
and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      (3)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies.
         (a)   The wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless
facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety
agency for public safety communications.
         (b)   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency’s communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will
be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the
FCC’s regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency.
         (c)   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 C.F.R. parts 22.970 through 22.973 and 47 C.F.R. parts 90.672
through 90.675.
         (d)   The city may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in division (B)(3)(c) above. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   Collocation.
         (a)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
         (b)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the city utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         (c)   For purposes of this division (B)(4), the terms COMMUNICATIONS
SPACE, COMMUNICATION WORKER SAFETY ZONE, and ELECTRIC SUPPLY ZONE have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (5)   Compliance with codes. The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
      (6)   Compliance with design standards. The wireless provider shall
comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for
decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic
requirements that are set forth in a city ordinance, written policy adopted by
the city, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to
other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a
historic district.
      (7)   Alternate placements.
         (a)   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and
conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the city may propose that
the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this division (B)(7).
      (8)   Height limitations.
         (a)   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the
small wireless facility is collocated.
         (b)   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures
on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a special use permit, or variance in conformance with
procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the city’s zoning ordinance.
      (10)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of- way.
      (11)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning, or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (C)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows.
      (1)   The applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an
application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing
utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350 for each small wireless
facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one
small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support
structures.
      (2)   The applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000 for each small
wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of
a new utility pole for such collocation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      (4)   The city shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the city at least ten days prior to the planned replacement
and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment
consistent with division (A)(1)(d) above; or
         (c)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes.
      (5)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the city to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (D)   Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      (1)   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the city or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      (2)   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code, being 605 ILCS 5/1-101 et

16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, being 220 ILCS 5/16-102, without the
consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility.
The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an electric or gas public
utility or such utility’s wireless facilities if the facilities are being used,
developed and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of §
16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act, being 220 ILCS 5/16-108.5(I).
         (b)   1.   For the purposes of this division (D)(3), PUBLIC UTILITY
has the meaning given to that term in § 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act,

person from any requirement to:
               a.   Obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer
cable service or video service; or
               b.   Obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain,
or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities
subject to this chapter.
   (E)   Pre-existing agreements.
      (1)   Existing agreements between the city and wireless providers that
relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way,
including the collocation of small wireless facilities on city utility poles,

provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall
comply with this chapter.
      (2)   A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the city on
the effective date of the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act, being 50
ILCS 840/1 et seq., may accept the rates, fees, and terms that the city makes
available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless facilities
or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless
facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two or more years
after the effective date of the Act by notifying the city that it opts to
accept such rates, fees, and terms. The existing agreement remains in effect,
subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities

of written notice from the city notifying the wireless provider of the
abandonment. The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the city to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider.
         (b)   If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days of
such notice, the city may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant

against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole
negligence of the city or its employees or agents.
   (C)   A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have
against the city with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,

§ 130.07 VAGRANCY.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person wandering aboard and occupying,
lodging, or sleeping in any vacant or unoccupied barn, garage, shed, shop, or
other building or structure, or in any automobile, truck, railroad car, or

person entitled to the possession of the same, or sleeping in any vacant lot
during the hours of darkness and not giving a satisfactorily account for
himself or herself.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person wandering abroad and begging; or
any person who goes about from door to door of private homes or commercial and
business establishments, or places himself or herself in or upon any public way
or public place to beg or receive alms for himself or herself.
   (D)   It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any
thoroughfare or place open to the public for the purpose of inducing, enticing,
soliciting, or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such action is
consistent with the intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to
commit an act of prostitution are that the person is a known prostitute or
panderer and repeatedly beckons, in the attempt to stop or engage male or
female passersby in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor
vehicles by engaging their operators by hailing, waving of arms, or other
bodily gestures. The violator’s conduct must be such as to demonstrate a
specific intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act
of prostitution. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this division
unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain
his or her conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating this division if
it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful
purpose.
   (E)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles

§ 130.09 BATTERY.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to intentionally or knowingly, without
legal justification and by any means:
   (A)   Cause bodily harm to any individual; and
   (B)   Make physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with an
individual.

130.99

(Prior Code, § 151.01) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% probability of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year. The BASE FLOOD is also known as the 100-YEAR FLOOD. The base
flood elevation at any location is as defined in §
151.04.
   BUILDING. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes prefabricated building. The term also
includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site
for more than 180 days.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any human-made change to real estate, including:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a building or any
addition to a building valued at more than $1,000;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180
days;
         (c)   Installing utilities, construction of roads, or similar
projects;
         (d)   Construction or erection of levees, walls, fences, bridges or
culverts;
         (e)   Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating, or
other nonagricultural alterations of the ground surface;
         (f)   Storage of materials; or
         (g)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include maintenance of existing buildings and
facilities such as re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and
similar agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, or
construction of levees.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of inundation of normally dry land
areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of
surface waters from any source.
   FLOODWAY. That portion of the SFHA required to store and convey the base
flood. The FLOODWAY for the SFHAs of the city shall be according to the best
data available to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information
Repository.
   FPE or FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The elevation of the base flood plus one
foot at any given location in the SFHA.
   RIVERINE SFHA. Any SFHA subject to flooding from a river, creek,
intermittent stream, ditch, or any other identified channel. This term does not
include areas subject to flooding from lakes (except public bodies of water),
ponding areas, areas of sheet flow, or other areas not subject to overbank
flooding.
   SFHA or SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the city that are subject to inundation by the base flood. The SFHAs of the
city are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map of the
city prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated May 1, 1979.
The SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Madison County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city
are generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map prepared for
Madison County by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated April 15,
1982.
(Prior Code, § 151.02) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.03 DUTIES OF THE BUILDING OFFICIAL.

chapter. Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance; and
   (H)   Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood
data, SFHA maps, copies of federal or state permit documents and “as built”
elevation and floodproofing data for all buildings constructed subject to this
chapter.
(Prior Code, § 151.03) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.04 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.
   This chapter’s protection standard is the base flood. The best available
base flood data are listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party may finance the detailed engineering study needed to
replace existing data with better data and submit it to the State Water Survey
and the Federal Management Agency.
   (A)   The base flood elevation for the SFHAs of Mississippi River and
Tribulaties 1 and 2 shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in
the flood insurance study of the city prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and dated November 1978.
   (B)   The base flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an “AH Zone” or
“AO Zone” shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance
rate map of the city.
   (C)   The base flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as
an “A Zone” on the flood insurance rate map of the city shall be according to
the best data available to the Illinois State Water Survey Flood Plain
Information Repository. When no base flood elevation exists, the base flood
elevation shall be the 100-year flood depth calculated according to the
formulas presented in Depth and Frequency of Floods in Illinois published by
the U.S. Geological Survey, 1976.
   (D)   The base flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of
unincorporated Madison County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction
of the city or that may be annexed into the city shall be as delineated on the
100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Madison County prepared
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated October 15, 1981.
(Prior Code, § 151.04) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.05 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law
shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
development permit from the Building Official. The Building Official shall not
issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for a development permit shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions: existing
grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling;
the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and
the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed
buildings subject to the requirements of §
151.07.
   (B)   The application shall also contain information or certification as
reasonably may be required by the Building Inspector in order to determine
eligibility for permits or to enforce the terms of this chapter.
   (C)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the Building
Official shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood elevation.
Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the
base flood elevation as of the date of the site’s first flood insurance rate
map identification is not located in the SFHA and therefore not subject to the
requirements of this chapter. The Building Official shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site’s first flood insurance rate map identification.
   (D)   The Building Official shall inform the applicant of any and all other
local, state, and federal permits that may be required for this type of
development activity. The Building Official shall not issue the development
permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained.

151.99
§ 151.06 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES.
   No development in the SFHA shall create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health and safety.
   (A)   Standards within riverine SFHAs. Within all riverine SFHAs, the
following standards shall apply:
      (1)   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway (or in a riverine SFHA
where no floodway has been identified) shall not be issued unless the applicant
first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required
from the Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources,
issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq.;
      (2)   The following activities may be constructed without the individual
permit required in division (A)(1) above in accordance with statewide permits
issued by the Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of Water
Resources, provided the activities do not involve placement of fill, change of
grade, or construction in the normal channel. Such activities must still meet
the other requirements of this chapter:
         (a)   The construction of wells, septic tanks, and underground utility
lines not crossing a lake or stream;
         (b)   The construction of light poles, sign posts, and similar
structures;
         (c)   The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic fields
(excluding fences), patios, and similar surfaces which are built at grade;
         (d)   The construction of property anchored buildings not exceeding 70
square feet in size, nor ten feet in any dimension (e.g. animal shelters and
tool sheds); and
         (e)   The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not
increase the first floor area by more than 20%, which are located on the
upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and which do not extend
beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the flow of
flood waters.
      (3)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the base flood elevation more than one foot for the affected hydraulic reach of
the stream and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
   (B)   Public health standards in all SFHAs.
      (1)   No development in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE a unless such materials are
stored in a storage tank or floodproofed building constructed according to the
requirements of §
151.07(A)(3).
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal
systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other above ground openings
located below the PFE are water-tight.

(Prior Code, § 151.11) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.12 WATERCOURSE STANDARDS.
   The Building Inspector shall notify adjacent communities and the Illinois
Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources and the Federal
Insurance Administration prior to any alteration or relocation of a water
measure. The flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of
any watercourse shall be maintained.
(Prior Code, § 151.12) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.13 REPORTS AND RECORDS.
   (A)   The Building Inspector shall provide the City Council, the Illinois
Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources, and the Federal
Insurance Administration with an annual report on forms as provided the city by

(Prior Code, § 151.13) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.14 VARIANCE.
   Upon application and after 15 days’ notice of a public hearing, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may grant a variance of the this chapter subject to compliance
with the following procedures and such other conditions as the Board of Zoning
Appeals deems necessary to comply with the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
   (B)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures construable below the base flood
level, in conformance with the procedures of divisions (C), (D), and (E) below.
While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than
one-half acre, deviations from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot
size increases beyond a one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing a variance increases.
   (C)   Variances shall be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause,
a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in an
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and a determination that the granting of
a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinance.
   (D)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (E)   The Building Inspector shall notify the applicant in writing that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as
$25 for $100 of insurance coverage and such construction below the base flood
level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in division (F)
above.
   (F)   The Building Inspector shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances
issued in the annual report submitted to the City Council, the Illinois
Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources, and the Federal
Insurance Administration.
(Prior Code, § 151.14) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.15 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height
may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply
that development either inside or outside of areas designated as flood hazard
areas will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Prior Code, § 151.15) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.16 VIOLATIONS.
   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof be fined
as set forth in §
151.99, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in
litigation. A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues.
   (A)   The City Attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   (B)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
(Prior Code, § 151.16) (Ord. 89-9, passed 12-18-1989)
§ 151.17 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the City
Council to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including: Ordinances 77-4 and 79-7. However, this chapter does not repeal the
original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the Program.

§ 156.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Any person, firm, corporation or business proposing to develop land
for non-agricultural purposes within the city shall apply to the Building and
Zoning Department for approval of required erosion control plans and issuance
of a grading permit as specified in this regulation.
   (B)   Upon approval of the required erosion control plan and prior to the
issuance of a grading permit, the city shall require the developer to post a
performance guarantee, bond, or letter of credit of which shall not expire
before the completion of the project in the amount of all work to be done under
the erosion control plan. Such guarantee shall be in an amount determined by
the Building and Zoning Official as equal to the estimated costs of
constructing proper erosion control measures for the project. The entire amount
will be held until the public improvements are accepted by the city to insure
that the erosion control measures are performed and maintained. This guarantee
does not apply for singular, residential structures.
(Prior Code, § 156.00) (Ord. 99-13, passed 9-7-1999)
§ 156.02 REGULATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Less than two acres. Improvement plans for grading land areas two
acres or less for noncommercial uses shall include the following information.
All commercial development less than two acres shall abide by the requirements
of division (B) below:
      (1)   Full name and address of property owner;
      (2)   Designation of property address and a location map, parcel ID#;
      (3)   Existing grade and topography of the premises and the approximate
proposed finished grade showing contours of not more than two feet;
      (4)   Submit a plan sheet detailing both temporary and permanent erosion
control devices to be utilized such as silt fence, rip rap, bales, sediment
basins, and the like;
      (5)   An estimate of cost to construct temporary and permanent erosion
control measures;
      (6)   A statement indicating that public roadways, sidewalks, R.O.W. will
be protected from sediment/runoff resulting from work using best management
practices, and that upon notification, corrective action will be completed
within 48 hours;
      (7)   Identify areas within an established flood plain, floodway, or
wetland; and
      (8)   A statement from the property owner or his or her agent assuming
full responsibility for the performance of the operation of erosion control
measures indicated in the application.
   (B)   Two through five acres. Grading plans, site plans, preliminary plat of
subdivision, or the subdivision improvement plans for grading land areas two
acres or more, and all commercial developments up to five acres shall include
the following additional information. Three sets of plans and specifications
shall be required:
      (1)   Full name and address of property owner;
      (2)   Designation of property address and a location map, parcel ID#;
      (3)   Portion of the property that is to be excavated, graded, or filled
with excavated material;
      (4)   Location of any sewerage disposal system or underground utility
line, any part of which is within 50 feet of the proposed excavation, grading,
or filling area and the location of any pipe line within 100 feet of the
proposed excavation, grading, or filling area;
      (5)   Existing grade and topography of the premises and the proposed
finished grade and final contour elevation at a contour interval of not more
than two feet on United States Geological Survey datum;
      (6)   Location and present status of any previous permitted grading
operations on the property;
      (7)   Submit on a plan sheet details and locations of erosion, control
devices to be utilized such as silt fence, rip rap, bales, sediment basins, and
the like;
      (8)   A plan sheet showing any permanent erosion/sediment control
devices;
      (9)   An estimate of cost to construct temporary and permanent erosion
control measures;
      (10)   A statement indicating that public roadways, sidewalks, R.O.W.
will be protected from sediment/runoff resulting from work using best
management practices, and that upon notification, corrective action will be
completed within 48 hours; and
      (11)   Identify areas within an established floodplain, floodway, or
wetland.
   (C)   Five acres or more. In addition to the requirements in division (B)
above, development on sites where five or more acres are disturbed will require
an NPDES permit from the state which will address erosion and sediment issues.
A copy of that plan shall be provided to the city, along with an estimate of
costs for temporary and permanent measures. These developments would require a
statement from a registered engineer certifying that the water leaving the site
after development would discharge in the same locations and at the same rates
as pre-development conditions. The performance guarantee as specified
previously will be required, based upon an estimate of costs for erosion
control provided by the registered engineer.
   (D)   Supplemental information/special considerations.
      (1)   Upon submittal of any site plan (regardless of the size of the
tract involved or the use) the city may request additional information. Sites
with large amounts of cut or fill or sharp contours may require a site visit
with the owner or his or her representative to discuss the plan. Also, in the
case of larger tracts or commercial uses the city reserves the right to obtain
an independent review of release rates and elements of the plan by a third-
party licensed professional engineer. In those instances, where independent
review finds information contained in the original submittal inaccurate or
incomplete, expenses incurred for this review will be paid by the applicant.
      (2)   Placement of detention basins within a flood plain are discouraged
because of questions about their liability during flood events. However,
detention required by this chapter may be accomplished in and adjacent to these
areas provided that the following provisions are met. In these areas, provide
compensatory storage of one and one-half times the volume below the base flood
elevation occupied by the detention basin, including any berms or embankments.
All flood plain storage below the existing ten-year elevation shall be replaced
below the ten year elevation. All the flood plain storage lost above the ten-
year elevation shall be replaced above the existing ten-year elevation. All
compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and at
comparable rates to the original watercourse.
(Prior Code, § 156.01) (Ord. 99-13, passed 9-7-1999; Ord. 01-6, passed 3-5-
2001)
§ 156.03 PLAN REVIEW AND APPROVAL.
   Submit the plan containing the information above to the city for review and
approval. Review and approval should come within two weeks of submitting a
complete plan. Once a site grading permit has been issued, work can begin.
   (A)   Plan. The sediment and erosion control plan must define the measures
to be taken to meet erosion control principles and standards as defined in
these regulations. The plan must assure that sediment is not transported from
the site by a storm event of ten years, 24-hour frequency rainfall as published
by the Illinois State Water Survey rainfall for this region less the allowable
release rate.
   (B)   Conservation district comments.
      (1)   When a plan is submitted to the city, the plan shall also be
submitted to the Madison County Soil and Water Conservation District.
      (2)   Such comments may pertain, but need not be limited to:
         (a)   Erosion and sedimentation control;
         (b)   Soil use limitations;
         (c)   Environmental considerations;
         (d)   Contact County Soil and Water Conservation District, P.O. Box
482 Edwardsville, IL 62025 - Phone #656-5166; and
         (e)   A small fee is charged for this service.
(Prior Code, § 156.02) (Ord. 99-13, passed 9-7-1999)
§ 156.04 DESIGN PRINCIPALS AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   All excavations, grading, or filling shall have a finished grade not
to exceed a 3:1 slope (33%). Steeper grades may be approved if the excavation
is through rock or the excavation or the fill is adequately protected (a
designed head wall or toe wall may be required). Retaining walls that exceed a
height of four feet shall require the construction of safety guards as
identified in the appropriate section(s) of the adopted BOCA Codes and must be
approved by the City Building Department. Permanent safety guards will be
constructed in accordance with the appropriate section(s) of the adopted BOCA
Codes.
   (B)   Sediment and erosion control plans for sites that exceed one acre of
grading shall provide for sediment or debris basins, silt traps or filters,
staked straw bales or other approved measures to remove sediment from run-off
waters. Temporary siltation control measures shall be maintained until
vegetative cover is established at a sufficient density to provide erosion
control on the site.
      (1)   All lots less than one acre that are currently being constructed
upon as commercial or residential may be required to take action to control
silt run off to public right-of-way or private adjacent property as determined
by the building and zoning inspectors. Failure to install appropriate siltation
barriers to ease silt run off may result in stop work orders until corrective
action is taken.
      (2)   In addition, excessive siltation run off from construction sites
onto public streets will be cleaned by those responsible. If not cleaned at the
end of any work day, the city may have the street cleaned and the owner will
bear the costs associated with this work.
   (C)   (1)   Where natural vegetation is removed during grading, vegetation
shall be re-established in such a density as to prevent erosion. Permanent type
grasses shall be established as soon as possible or during the next seeding
period after grading has been completed. When grading operations are completed
or suspended for more than 30 days, temporary grass must be established at
sufficient density to provide erosion control on the site. Between permanent
grass seeding periods, temporary cover shall be provided according to the
designated officials’ recommendation.
      (2)   All finished grades (areas not to be disturbed by future
improvement) in excess of 20% slopes (5:1) shall be mulched and tacked at the
rate of 100 pounds per 1,000 square feet when seeded.
   (D)   (1)   Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff
caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after grading.
Unvegetated open channels shall be designed so that gradients result in
velocities of two fps (feet per second) or less.
      (2)   Open channels with velocities more than two fps and less than five
fps shall be established in permanent vegetation by use of commercial erosion
control blankets or lined with rock rip rap or concrete or other suitable
materials as approved. Detention basins, diversions, or other appropriate
structures shall be constructed to prevent velocities above five fps.
   (E)   The adjoining ground to development sites (lots) shall be provided
with protection from accelerated and increased surface water, silt from
erosion, and any other consequences of erosion. Run-off water from developed
areas (parking lots, paved sites, and buildings) above the area to be developed
shall be directed to diversions, detention basins, concrete gutters, and/or
underground outlet systems. Sufficiently anchored straw bales may be accepted
as a temporary substitute.
   (F)   Development along natural watercourses shall have residential,
commercial or industrial improvements, parking areas or driveways setback a
minimum of 25 feet from the top of the existing stream bank. The watercourse
shall be maintained and made the responsibility of the subdivision trustees or
in the case of a site plan by the property owner. Permanent vegetation should
be left intact. Variances will include designed streambank erosion control
measures and must be approved.
   (G)   FEMA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidelines shall be followed
where applicable regarding site development areas designated as flood plains
and wetlands.
   (H)   All lots shall be seeded and mulched at the rate of 200 pounds/acre or
sodded before an occupancy permit shall be issued except that a temporary
occupancy permit may be issued by the Building and Zoning Department in cases
of undue hardship because of unfavorable ground conditions.
(Prior Code, § 156.03) (Ord. 99-13, passed 9-7-1999)
§ 156.05 INSPECTION AND VIOLATION.
   (A)   Inspections. By applying for a grading permit, the applicant consents
to the city inspecting the proposed development site and all work in progress.
   (B)   Corrections. All violations shall be corrected within ten days of
receipt of a written notice by the designated official. All persons failing to
comply with such notice shall be deemed in violation of this regulation. In the
event written notice to the land developer cannot be delivered, notice posted
at the site of the violation shall be sufficient and the ten days shall date
from the date of posting.
   (C)   Violations. In the event of a violation, the performance guarantee,
bond, or letter of credit shall be used by the city to complete the planned
sediment and erosion control practices.
   (D)   Appeals. Any person denied a grading permit as herein stated shall
have the right to appeal such denial to the City Manager. Further appeal, if
necessary, shall be made to the City Council.

§ 159.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   It is the finding of the City Council that properties in the process of
foreclosure ("foreclosing" properties) and/or vacant unmaintained properties
are unsightly, unsafe, and have a negative effect on the health, life, safety,
and general and economic welfare of the community. Further, vacant and
unmaintained properties create a safety hazard for first responders entering or
responding to said properties. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a
program for identifying, registering, and monitoring such foreclosing and/or
vacant properties, to set forth the responsibility of all persons with any
interest in such properties, including mortgagees, lenders, trustees, and
service companies, and to encourage the rehabilitation and re-occupation of
such properties.

§ 159.08 REGISTRATION FEES; RENEWAL.
   (A)   The fee for registering a vacant structure of $100 shall be paid upon
initial registration of any foreclosing property or vacant structure. The
property must be registered as a vacant structure every six months. The
registration fee is due on January 1 and July 1 of each year. If a property is
deemed vacant, the fee will be prorated to the next deadline registration date.
   (B)   The fee for renewing the vacant structure registration each six months
shall be $100 if the property is still vacant as defined under this chapter.
The fee can be waived by the Director or his or her designee upon a
determination of eligibility, which shall include, but is not limited to,
progress on the plan to bring the building into compliance presented to the
Director or his or her designee. The fee runs with the land, not with the
owner.
   (C)   If a property, initially permitted under §
157.33, is subsequently deemed to be unoccupied, vacant or shows evidence of
vacancy, the foreclosing party, tax buyer, recipient of deed in lieu of
foreclosure or person shall file an amended registration form certifying the
property is vacant.
   (D)   If a property remains in foreclosure or vacant beyond the initial 24
month time period, the owner thereof is subject to a fine of not less than $50
nor more than $500 per day the property so remains;
   (E)   The registration shall be renewed every six months (in January and
July of each calendar year).
   (F)   Payment of the applicable registration fee does not relieve or exempt
the owner or other person from paying any and all fines, penalties, costs or
other such charges assessed for non-compliance with property maintenance
standards or other code provisions in this chapter or elsewhere in the city's
ordinances.

§ 159.09 VACANT, FORECLOSING PROPERTY INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Within 30 days of the initial vacant structure registration or the
registration of an amended foreclosing property registration after the property
becomes vacant, the city may, as necessary, conduct a comprehensive code-
compliance inspection of the entirety of the vacant building/property. Such
inspection will determine the extent of compliance with all applicable city
ordinances, including, without limitation, ordinances relating to property
maintenance, building, health, water, sewer and fire codes. The city shall send
any such inspection report to all registered owners and/or responsible parties
within 30 days of completion. Periodic re-inspections may take place, as
necessary, until code/ordinance compliance is achieved. Timely code/ordinance
compliance is required upon notification that violations exist on the property.
Failure to comply with this inspection requirement shall constitute a violation
and subject to fines set forth in §
159.99.
   (B)   All properties registered under this chapter shall comply with all
applicable ordinances pertaining to property located within the city limits as
set forth in the city's Code of Ordinances and as adopted by the City Council
from time to time. Registration does not exempt the owner from compliance with
all applicable codes and ordinances including this chapter, nor does it
preclude any of the actions the city is authorized to take pursuant to this
chapter, the city's ordinances and the laws of the State of Illinois.

§ 159.10 REQUIRED LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain liability
insurance on all vacant buildings. A certificate of insurance for each vacant
property shall be provided to the city with the initial vacant property
registration form and subsequent renewal applications whenever an insurance
policy has expired or there is a change of insurance carrier. All insurance
policies for vacant property shall provide written notice to the Director of
any lapse, cancellation or change in coverage within 30 days. Minimum insurance
amounts (and, if adjusted, to be adjusted at the sole discretion of the
Director) are as follows:
   (A)   Residential properties:
      (1)   Single-family and two units: $250,000;
      (2)   Three to 11 units: $750,000;
      (3)   12 to 49 units: $1,000,000; and

§ 159.11 TIME RESTRICTIONS - VACANT STRUCTURES.
   (A)   It is the policy of the city that boarding up of a vacant property is
a temporary solution to prevent unauthorized entry into a vacant building and
that boarded buildings are a public nuisance. A vacant structure may not remain
boarded up for longer than six months unless an extension of that time is
approved by the Director or the Director's designee in writing.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, the city shall retain
the right afforded under relevant state or local law to declare a non-compliant
vacant structure unsafe and/or a public nuisance. The city may pursue whatever
legal recourse afforded to it by law, including, but not limited to, the action
to abate a public nuisance or an action seeking the demolition of a dangerous
and unsafe building.

§ 159.12 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter or application thereof to any person or
circumstance is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be
given effect without the invalid application or provision, and each invalid
provision or invalid application of this chapter is severable.
(Ord. 24-10, passed 3-18-2024; Ord. 24-12, passed 4-1-2024; Ord. 25-1, passed

§ 159.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Except as otherwise set forth, any person found to be in violation of
any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of not less than $50
and not to exceed $500 per day. Each day that a violation continues after due
notice has been served shall be deemed a separate offense. Prosecution under
this section is a remedy cumulative to any and all other remedies at law and
equity, including, but not limited to, the remedies set forth herein.
   (B)   All fees, costs, or charges assessed or incurred by the city pursuant
to this chapter shall be a lien upon the real property. The lien shall be
superior to all subsequent liens and encumbrances. The Director shall file a
notice of lien after such cost and expense is incurred in the office of the
applicable County Recorder of Deeds. The lien may be enforced by proceedings to
foreclose, such as in the case of mortgage and mechanic's liens.
