§ 33.02 SICK LEAVE POLICY.
   (A)   The purpose of sick leave is to permit an employee to take time off
for an actual illness or injury, or a medical emergency. The purpose of sick
leave is not to provide paid holidays, and it is not the policy of the city to
permit sick leave to be taken unless one of the conditions required for sick
leave as described in this section actually exists.
   (B)   The city will allow all full-time employees sick leave with pay,
computed as hereinafter set forth, to accumulate at the rate of one working day
per month. There shall be no minimum days that an employee may accumulate. The
use of sick leave is subject to the following limitations and conditions:
      (1)   Accumulated sick leave may be used, not to exceed 15 working days
per calendar year, except that the entire amount of accumulated sick leave may
be used at one time should the employee undergo a major operation or a
protracted illness, or for disability coming under the Workmen's Compensation
Act.
      (2)   Accumulated sick leave with pay not to exceed 15 working days may
be used by female employees for pregnancy or complications arising out of
pregnancy, regardless whether or not such employee returns to work; provided,
such female employee shall have been continuously employed for a period of at
least one year.
      (3)   In granting sick leave with pay, the city reserves the right to
require a physician's certificate if the employee is off work for more than
three working days. A doctor's or other medical professional's statement may be
required upon return to work.
      (4)   Sick leave may be granted for any of the following reasons:
         (a)   Non-duty related illness, disability or injury of the employee
making it impossible or inadvisable for the employee to attend work.
         (b)   Illness of the employee's spouse, son, daughter, father or
mother, father-in-law or mother-in-law. The maximum leave that may be taken for
this purpose is three days.
         (c)   In the event of serious illness, disability, injury or death of
a member of the employee's immediate family. The maximum leave that may be
taken for this purpose is three days.
         (d)   An employee shall be eligible for sick leave for any appointment
made on the employee's own behalf, with any person licensed by the state to
perform any healing art, including any physician or dentist, optometrist or
other licensed practitioner, concerning the employee's physical health or
mental health in any way. Sick leave shall be granted whether the appointment
is for an examination, for prevention or for treatment.
         (e)   Sick leave shall be available to any employee hospitalized for
mental or emotional health problems, to the extent that accumulated sick leave
days are available, and sick leave shall also be for office appointments for
mental health and emotional health needs.
      (5)   In case of an injury making it impossible for an employee to
perform the employee's work, every effort will be made to assign the employee
to work that can be done within the limitations caused by the injury. If the
injury prevents the employee from doing any work at all for the city, the
employee shall be eligible for sick leave. If it feasible for an injured
employee to do work at home, work shall be provided for the injured employee to
do at home.
      (6)   (a)   Should the employer have cause to believe that an employee is
not fit-for-duty, the employer may request the employee to obtain from the
employee's medical provider a written statement certifying that the employee is
fit-for-duty. In the event the employee's medical provider's written statement
certifies that the employee is fit for light duty work only, then, in that
event, the written statement must also set forth the limitations on the
employee's duties.
         (b)   Should the employer have cause to believe that an employee is
not fit-for-duty, the employer may require that the employee have an
examination by a qualified and licensed medical professional selected by the
employer in order to determine the employee's fitness for duty. Any such
examination, and such related tests, shall be at the employer's expense. The
employee shall be notified in writing as to the objective facts leading the
city to require the examination. All time spent by the employee associated with
the examination shall be considered hours worked. The physician shall render an
opinion as to whether the employee is fit or unfit for duty; including a
suggested treatment regimen where appropriate. An employee found unfit for duty
shall be placed into an appropriate status. All opinions and reports shall be
considered confidential and their release shall only be as required by law.
         (c)   When the city's medical professional's opinion disagrees with
the employee's medical professional's opinion regarding the employee's fitness
for duty, a third doctor's opinion shall be the deciding factor. The third
doctor shall be chosen by agreement between the city's medical professional and
the employee's medical professional. The cost associated with the third
doctor's examination, and any related tests, shall be at the employer's
expense.
      (7)   It is grounds for termination of employment with the city if, upon
investigation, it is found that an employee is abusing or violating the sick
leave policy of the city.
      (8)   On the first day of sickness, as soon as possible, the employee
must notify his or her immediate supervisor that he or she will be unable to

§ 33.21 PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of the city to maintain effective employer-employee
relations and to give any employee an opportunity to present and discuss any
grievance. The grievance procedure set forth in §§
33.20 through
33.26 are designed to resolve any problem informally when it arises while
recognizing that there may be grievances which can be resolved only after
formal appeal and review.
(Ord. 06-20, passed 6-12-06)
§ 33.22 PROCEDURE.
   Before initiating a formal written grievance under §§
33.20 through
33.26, any employee shall within five working days of the incident giving rise
to the grievance, orally raise the grievance with his or her immediate
supervisor or department head through free and informal discussion in order to
resolve as many matters as possible. The supervisor or department head shall
have three working days in which to respond to the grievance. In the event that
any such grievance cannot be satisfactorily settled or resolved through this
informal means, or an answer is not given within the time specified, such
grievance shall be processed in the following manner:
   Step 1. Any affected employee shall present such grievance in writing on a
standard grievance form provided by the city for such purpose stating the facts
of the complaint to his or her department head within 12 working days after the
first occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance or 12 working days
after such affected employee through the use of reasonable diligence should
have known of the first occurrence of the event giving rise to such grievance.
The department head shall then attempt to adjust such grievance and shall
render a written response to the grievant within five working days after such
grievance is presented; except that a meeting may be held at the request of
either party to review the grievance at this step and said meeting shall be
within ten calendar days after such grievance is presented. The department head
shall have five working days from the date of the meeting to respond in writing
to the grievance in the event a meeting is held.
   Step 2. If such grievance is not satisfactorily settled under Step 1 or an
answer is not given in the time specified and the grievant desires to appeal
such grievance to Step 2, the grievant shall present such grievance in writing
to the committee chairperson of the appropriate committee of the City Council
within five working days after receipt of the department head's response in
Step 1, or within five working days of the time when such response would have
been due. The committee chairperson shall investigate such grievance and, in
the course of such investigation may, within ten calendar days from receipt of
such grievance at Step 2, offer to discuss such grievance at a meeting with the
grievant. The grievant may, in writing, request a meeting with the committee
chairperson, and if requested the meeting shall be held within ten calendar
days from the receipt of the request by the committee chairperson. If no
settlement of such grievance is reached, the committee chairperson shall
provide a written response to the grievant within ten calendar days following
the receipt of the grievance or following the date of the meeting with the
grievant, whichever is later.
   Step 3. If such grievance is not satisfactorily settled under Step 2 or an
answer is not given in the time specified and the grievant desires to appeal
such grievance to Step 3, the grievant shall present such grievance in writing
to the Mayor within five working days after receipt of the committee
chairperson's response in Step 2, or within five working days of the time when
such response would have been due. The Mayor shall investigate such grievance
and, in the course of such investigation may, within ten calendar days from
receipt of such grievance at Step 3, offer to discuss such grievance at a
meeting with the grievant. The grievant may, in writing, request a meeting with
the Mayor, and if requested the meeting shall be held within ten calendar days
from the receipt of the request by the Mayor. If no settlement of such
grievance is reached, the Mayor shall provide a written response to the
grievant within ten calendar days following the receipt of the grievance or
following the date of the meeting with the grievant, whichever is later.
   Step 4. If such grievance is not settled under Step 3 and the grievant
desires to appeal such grievance to Step 4, the grievant shall present such
grievance in writing to the City Clerk of the City Council within seven
calendar days after the receipt of the Mayor's response in Step 3 or within
seven calendar days of the time when such response would have been due.
Thereafter, the members of the City Council, the Mayor and the department head
shall meet with the grievant to discuss such grievance. The meeting date and
time shall be set and announced at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the
City Council after receipt of the grievance, which date shall be within 15 days
of the date of said regularly scheduled City Council meeting. The City Council
shall provide a written decision to the grievant within ten calendar days
following the date of the meeting with the grievant. The written decision of
the City Council shall be final. Only a quorum of the members of the City
Council shall be required in order to proceed with the meeting provided in this

causes, and in order to ensure that this municipality will be prepared to and

   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not

local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after the final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.

§ 51.67 BILLING OF CHARGES.
   (A)   For the purpose of billing charges for service of said combined
waterworks and sewerage system, the territory served by said system shall be
divided into two sections, with all such territory located east of the center
line of the Illinois central railroad right-of-way as it extends through said
city being designated the east section, and all such territory located west of
said center line being designated the west section.
   (B)   Each premise served by said system located in the east section shall
be billed on May 1, 1964, for the service in the preceding month, and
thereafter on the first day of each succeeding second calendar month for
service in the preceding bi-monthly period.
   (C)   Each premise served by said system located in the west section shall
be billed on June 1, 1964, for the service in the preceding two months, and
thereafter on the first day of each succeeding second calendar month for
service in the preceding bi-monthly period.
   (D)   All charges for service shall be due and payable on rendition of bill,
and if not paid on or before the tenth day of the month in which billed, the
sum of 10% of the amount of such bill shall be added thereto and be due and
payable, except that when the tenth day of the month shall be a Sunday or legal
holiday, then such bill may be paid on the next succeeding secular day without
such additional charge. If charges are not paid within 15 days from date
billed, water service shall be promptly shut off and all other service to the
premises discontinued until such time as all charges have been paid in full.
   (E)   In the event charges for any of the services of said system are not
paid within 30 days after bill rendered, such charges shall be deemed and are
hereby declared to be delinquent and thereafter shall constitute a lien upon
the real estate upon or for which service shall have been supplied. A sworn
statement shall be filed in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Ford County,
Illinois, by the City Clerk, setting out a description of such real estate
sufficient for identification thereof, the amount due for such service, and the
date when such amount became delinquent, which shall be deemed notice of the
lien for payment of such service. The failure of the City Clerk to record such
lien shall not affect the right to foreclose the same. Property subject to such
lien shall be sold for non-payment of the same and the proceeds applied to pay
the charges, after deducting costs. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity
in the name of the city, and the City Attorney is hereby authorized and
directed to institute such proceedings, in the name of the city, in any court
having jurisdiction.
   (F)   No person, other than the owner of the premises for which service is
supplied, shall be furnished or supplied with water service until such person
shall have deposited with the City Clerk, of the city, the sum of $25, as
security for the payment of all water used by or water service furnished to
such person upon such premises. When such service is discontinued, said
deposit, less any amount then due the city for water service, shall be
refunded, without interest. No such deposit shall be required if the owner of
such premises shall, in writing, assume full responsibility for the payment of
all water used upon such premises.
   (G)   There shall be no bulk discounts given by the city for water used to
fill swimming pools. No person, firm or corporation, including the Fire
Protection District, shall use water from a fire hydrant for the purpose of
filling a swimming pool. Any person, firm or corporation violating this section
by illegally filling a swimming pool shall be fined according to §
51.99, and a separate offense shall be deemed committed for each and every day
during which a violation continues or exists.

§ 51.68 SPECIAL CHARGES.
   Notwithstanding the rates and charges hereinabove provided, the following
special charges are hereby established:
   (A)   In the case of any premise obtaining water, in whole or in part, from
a source or sources other than the combined waterworks and sewerage system of
the city, the base user charge for service shall be determined by applying a
rate of $3.15 per 1,000 gallons for each class, as set out in §
51.66, above, to the total quantity of water used or consumed on such premise
as a sewerage charge, and adding to the sum thus determined a base user charge
of $3.10 per 1,000 gallons for water service to the quantity of water received
from the city's system, if any. For the purpose of determining the total
quantity of water used or consumed on such premise, the owner or occupant may
install, at his or her own expense and subject to the approval of the
Superintendent of Waterworks of the city, a separate meter to measure the
quantities of water obtained from such private source. If no such meter is
installed, or if the Superintendent shall not approve the method of
installation or adequacy of such metering, then such Superintendent shall
estimate the total quantity of water used or consumed on such premise in each
bi-monthly period and charges shall be based on such estimated quantity of
water consumed or used.
   (B)   In the case of any premise on which some of the water used or consumed
thereon is not contaminated by human or industrial waste and is not returned or
discharged into the sanitary sewers of said city the owner or occupant of such
premise shall have the option of paying charges as hereinabove provided or to
install, at his or her own expense, a suitable meter or meters to measure water
used on such premise which is not so contaminated nor returned to the sanitary
sewers. If the Superintendent of the city's Water and Sewer Department is
satisfied that such method of metering accurately measures the quantity of
water not returned to the sanitary sewers and that such water is not so
contaminated, the base user charge for service to said premise shall be
computed by applying a rate of $3.10 per 1,000 gallons for each user class, as
set out in §
51.66, above, to the total quantity of water received from the city's system,
as a charge for water, and adding thereto, as a base user charge for sewerage,
a rate of $3.15 per 1,000 gallons, to the total quantity of water used on such
premise less the amount ascertained not to have been returned to the sanitary
sewers.
   (C)   In the case of any premise which receives water from the city's system
but which does not discharge sewage, waste, or septic tank effluent of any
nature into any public sewer, drain, tile, ditch, or stream located within the
city, and which premise is located more than 200 feet distant, measured along
public ways from the nearest point of land of such premise, from the location
of an existing sanitary sewer, the base user charge for water used or consumed
on such premise obtained from the city's system shall be a rate of $3.10 per
1,000 gallons for each user class, as set out in §
51.66, above.
   (D)   In any case where more than one premise receives water through a
single meter, charges for water and/or sewerage service for each billing period
shall be determined, as hereinabove provided in §§
51.66 or
51.70, whichever may be applicable, and each premise so served shall be billed
an equal share of the resulting total charge, but not less than the flat rate
debt service charge provided for herein.
   (E)   The flat rate debt service charge for any bi-monthly period for any
premises as to which any of the foregoing provisions of this section may be
applicable shall be $34.75 provided, however, in the case of any premise for
which no charge for water service is applicable or for which no charge for
sewerage is applicable, such flat rate debt service charge shall be $34.75.
   (F)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for each premise
located outside the corporate limits of the city which receives water from said
system, either directly or indirectly, or which discharges sewage or other
domestic or industrial waste or septic tank effluent into any sewer, drain, or
tile installed and maintained by the city, whether located within or outside
the corporate limits of said city, or into any public stream or ditch located
within such corporate limits, the charge for such service shall be 200% of the
charge determined under the preceding provisions of this section.
   (G)   For all purposes of this section, the term "premise" is hereby defined
to include each tract or parcel of land or house, apartment, room, building, or
other structure or part thereof used or occupied, or suitable to be used or
occupied, by a single family, housekeeping unit, business, or industry, and
where more than one family, housekeeping unit, business, or industry uses or
occupies a single tract or parcel of land, building, or other structure, such
part used or occupied by each shall be regarded as a separate premise.
   (H)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an overstrength waste
surcharge will be levied to all users whose wastewaters exceed the normal
concentrations for BOD5 (225 mg/l) and SS (265 mg/l). The surcharge will be
based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all
wastes which exceed the 225 mg/l and 265 mg/l concentration for BOD5 and SS
respectively. This overstrength waste surcharge will be $14.10 per 100 pounds
of five day bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and $12.14 per 100 pounds of

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the
wastewater collection and publicly owned treatment works (hereinafter referred
to as “POTW”) for the city and enables the city to comply with all applicable
state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and
the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403). The objectives of this
chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with the operation of the POTW;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will
pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise
be incompatible with the POTW;
      (3)   To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge
is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with
applicable statutes and regulations;
      (4)   To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and
sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;
      (5)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the POTW;
      (6)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and
      (7)   To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions,
sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to
which the POTW is subject.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to all industrial users of the POTW. The
ordinance authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes
monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities; establishes administrative
review procedures; requires industrial user reporting; and provides for the
setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the
program established herein.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.002 ADMINISTRATION.
   Except as otherwise provided herein, the Superintendent of Waterworks of the
city shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter.
Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the Superintendent may be

the city a report containing the information described in §
52.095(B)(4) through (6). For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial
user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report
shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
52.061.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.098 PERIOD COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard
shall, at a frequency determined by the Superintendent but in no case less than
twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature
and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance with §
52.061.
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in
good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   (C)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and of
this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW,
using the procedures prescribed in §
52.105, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.099 REPORT OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Each industrial user is required to notify the Superintendent of any
planned significant changes to the industrial user’s operations or system which
might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days
before the change.
   (B)   The Superintendent may require the industrial user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
52.060.
   (C)   The Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
52.062 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
52.078.
   (D)   No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s)
until and unless the Superintendent has responded to the industrial user's
notice.
   (E)   For purposes of this requirement flow increases of 10% or greater, and
the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed
significant.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.100 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge or a slug load which may cause potential problems for
the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in §
52.020), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately
telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include
the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall,
unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or
any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be
imposed by this chapter.
   (C)   Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be
deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
   (D)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user’s bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of
a discharge described in division (A) of this section. Employers shall ensure
that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.101 REPORTS FROM NONSIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and
not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the city as the Superintendent may require.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.102 NOTICE OF VIOLATION; REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
industrial user must notify the Control Authority within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is
not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial
user’s at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the
industrial user’s initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the
results of this sampling.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.103 NOTIFICATION OF DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   (1)   Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous
waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into
the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR 261.
      (2)   The notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more
than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month and an estimation of the mass
of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed discharges must be submitted under §
52.099. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
52.095,
52.097 and
52.098.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) of this
section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CPR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e)
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial
user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.104 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136
does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by the EPA.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.105 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) of this section, the industrial
user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite
collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible,
the Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or
through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this
will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
toxicity, sulfides and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.106 DETERMINATION OF NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Superintendent may use a grab sample(s) to determine noncompliance with
pretreatment standards.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.107 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report
shall govern.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.108 RECORD KEEPING.
   Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and
copying, all records and information required to be retained under this
chapter. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning compliance with this chapter or where the industrial user
has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the
Superintendent.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 52.120 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any
industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and any
permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial user
is complying with all requirements thereof. Industrial users shall allow the
Superintendent or his or her representatives ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying and the performance of any additional duties.
   (B)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city,
state and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.
   (C)   The city, state and EPA shall have the right to set up on the
industrial user's property or require installation of such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
   (D)   The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow
and quality shall be calibrated periodically to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
industrial user.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the
industrial user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
Penalty, see § 52.999
§ 52.121 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or
property or any part thereof, and if the Superintendent has demonstrated
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter or that
there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then upon application by the City Attorney, the Judge of the Circuit
Court shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the
specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if
anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property described. Such warrant
shall be served at reasonable hours by the Superintendent in the company of a
uniformed police officer of the city. In the event of an emergency affecting
public health and safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a
warrant.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.122 PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the city where the POTW is located, a list of the industrial users
which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (B)   The term SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month
period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4
for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except
pH);
      (3)   Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment or has resulted in the city’s exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final
compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
      (8)   Any other violation(s) which the city determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 52.135 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever the Superintendent finds that any user has violated or is violating
this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any
other pretreatment requirement, the Superintendent or his or her agent may
serve upon the user a written notice of violation. Within five days of the
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Superintendent. Submission of
this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of
violation.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.136 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Superintendent is empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. The orders will include specific action
to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.137 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge (after
informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge
(after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW or which presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings set forth in §
52.138 are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the Superintendent, prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under this section and §
52.138
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.138 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   In addition to those provisions in §
52.080, any user that violates the following conditions of this chapter,
wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder is subject to discharge
termination:
   (A)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   (B)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   (C)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
   (D)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling;
   (E)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
52.020 et seq.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.139 WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE.
   Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this
chapter, orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, water service
to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user’s
expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.140 PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   Any violation of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued
hereunder is declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as
directed by the Superintendent or his or her designee. Any person(s) creating a
public nuisance shall be required to reimburse the city for all costs,
including attorney fees and court costs, incurred in removing, abating or
remedying the nuisance.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.141 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (3) are met.
      (3)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs or other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         (c)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
upset; provided, however, that if this information is provided orally, a
written submission must be provided within five days:
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue;
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to
the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (B)   General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in §
52.020 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its
discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the
industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and
during, the pass through or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1) (a) BYPASS means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
         (b)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of subsections (3) and (4) of this section.
      (3)   (a)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the
date of the bypass if possible.
         (b)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware
of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-
case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement
action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The industrial user submitted notices as required under
subsection (3) of this section.
         (b)   The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in subsection (4)(a) of this section.
(Ord. 99-26, passed 9-13-99)
§ 52.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   Any user which has violated or continues to violate this chapter,
any order or wastewater discharge permit hereunder or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement shall be liable to the Superintendent for a maximum
civil penalty of $750 per violation per day. In the case of a monthly or other
long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during
the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses and the cost of any actual damages incurred by
the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the
user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice
requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   Any user that willfully or negligently violates any provision of
this chapter, any orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder or
any other pretreatment requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $750 per violation per day
or imprisonment for not more than six months or both.
      (2)   Any user that willfully or negligently introduces any substance
into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least
$250 and/or be subject to imprisonment for not more than six months. This
penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury
or property damage available under state law.
      (3)   Any user that knowingly makes any false statements, representations
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other
documentation filed or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter,
wastewater discharge permit or order or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than
$750 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than six months or
both.
      (4)   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a
fine of not more than $750 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more
than six months or both.
   (C)   Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment
standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter,
wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment requirement, the Superintendent may petition the Circuit Court of
Ford County, Illinois, through the City Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the industrial user. Such
other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be
sought by the city. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a
prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.
   (D)   Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions in §
52.122, §§
52.135 et seq. and this section are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves
the right to take any, all or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city
reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.

indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in §

signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.

unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in §
70.32, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway
before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall then start to cross
the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to
make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection
to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked
stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then
before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing until an indication
permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is shown.
      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and the city
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2)
of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways. The driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in §
70.32, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall
not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can

   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this city at a speed
which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.
Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person
or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and
the duty of all persons to use due care.
   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which is
greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by

per hour while passing a school zone, or while traveling upon any public
thoroughfare where children pass going to and from school.
   (C)   This section shall not be applicable unless appropriate signs are
posted upon streets wherein the school zone is located. The signs shall give
proper due warning that a school zone is being approached, and shall indicate
the school zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when
school children are present. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of
electronic speed-detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special
school speed zone indicating the zone, as defined in this section, nor shall
evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speed,
provided the use of the device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed
limit in the special school speed zone.
   (D)   Except as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §11-605(e-5), a person who
violates this section is guilty of a petty offense. Violations of this section
are punishable with a minimum fine of $150 for the first violation and a
minimum fine of $300 for the second or subsequent violation.
   (E)   (1)   When a fine for a violation of this section is $150 or greater,

purposes. If the violation occurred in a dual school district, $25 of the

track equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an
immediate hazard;
         (d)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing;
         (e)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
      (2)   Whenever a person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing where the driver is not always required to stop but must slow down,
the person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad
track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the
circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall slow down within 50 feet
but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not
proceed until he or she checks that the tracks are clear of an approaching
train or railroad track equipment.
   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around, or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (C)   When stop signs are erected at railroad grade crossings, the driver of
any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the
nearest rail of the railroad, and shall proceed only upon exercising due care.
   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs,
without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates, or a
human flagger giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad
track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly
marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not less than 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment
after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference
is prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.
   (E)   No person may drive any vehicle through a railroad crossing if there
is insufficient space to drive completely through the crossing without
stopping.
   (F)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section. A first conviction
of a person for a violation of any part of this section shall result in a
mandatory fine of $250. All subsequent convictions of that person for any
violation of any part of this section shall result in a mandatory fine of $500.

      (1)   At any railroad grade crossing where traffic is controlled by a

§ 97.036 SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   All plans and specifications must conform to the following minimum
requirements before permit for construction or reconstruction shall be
permitted.
      (1)   Driveways for other than residential or dwelling house use shall be
constructed of Portland cement concrete at least six inches in thickness.
Concrete shall be as specified by ordinance for sidewalks and in accordance
with sketches on file in the office of the Superintendent of Streets at all
times.
      (2)   Driveways for residential or dwelling house use shall be
constructed of gravel, concrete or macadam, or in a manner and of a material
equal at least to that existing for the paving in the public street adjacent
thereto, except that where concrete pavement exists in the public street and
bituminous concrete surface is desired for the driveway, such surface shall be
permitted provided it shall have a minimum thickness of two inches placed upon
a compacted stone base at least six inches thick..
      (3)   Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across the
sidewalk space, it shall conform to the sidewalk grade as established by the
City Engineer.
      (4)   Where a driveway of any kind of material is constructed across an
existing sidewalk, the sidewalk shall be removed and replaced with Portland
cement concrete for the full width of the driveway and for a distance of at
least 12 inches on both sides of the driveway. This portion shall be not less
than six inches in thickness and constructed in accordance with sketches on
file in the office of the Superintendent of Streets.
      (5)   Macadam, gravel, and other types of driveways where permitted
herein shall be not less than six inches compacted thickness including the
base. A base of at least four inches of CA 5 two inch stone shall be installed.
If the driveway is to be constructed of gravel, then, in that event, two inches
of CA 10 road pack stone shall be installed over the base.
      (6)   Where paving in the public street is of concrete and a concrete
driveway is constructed, a one-inch bituminous premolded expansion joint with a
load transmission unit shall be placed approximately three feet from the edge
of the concrete paving and normal to the center line of the driveway, in
accordance with sketches illustrating such construction on file with the
Superintendent of Streets.
      (7)   The width of the driveways for other than residential or dwelling
house use shall not exceed 30 feet at the outer or street edge of the sidewalk.
Where two driveways are provided for the same or adjoining property, a safety
island of not less than 10 feet at the outer or street side of the sidewalk
shall be provided. Not more than two such driveways shall be allowed to any one
owner for any one piece of property on any one street for each 100 feet of
continuous frontage thereof.
      (8)   The width of the driveways for residential or dwelling house use
shall be not less than 9 feet or more than 14 feet at the outer or street edge
of the sidewalk.
      (9)   The width of the driveway opening at the curb line shall not exceed
the width of the driveway at the inner or property edge plus 20 feet, nor be
less than the width of the driveway at the inner or property edge of the
sidewalk plus 10 feet. In no instance should the radius be less than 3 feet at
curb corners, and this only when the driveway is flared or more than 10 feet
when the driveway is at right angles to the street line. The center line of all
driveways must be approximately at right angles to the curb line of the
pavement in the public street for a distance of at least 10 feet from said curb
line.
      (10)   All driveways shall be so graded between the gutter and the
sidewalk that it will not be necessary to change the established grade of
either and will not elevate or depress any portion of either. No part of the
driveway shall extend beyond the curb line in such a manner as to change the
grade of the gutter or obstruct the free flow of water in the gutter. Where
elevations or depressions are necessary in the parkway strip between the curb
and walk, the parkway shall be graded on both sides of the driveway to a
distance sufficient to create a gradual ascent or descent. At no time shall the
gradient exceed one foot vertical to ten feet horizontal.
      (11)   Combined curb and gutter and separate curbing shall be entirely
removed for the full width of the driveway opening at the curb line. If an
existing joint in said curb is within five feet of the end of the driveway
opening, remove the existing curbing and the like to the joint, otherwise cut
the combined curb and gutter or separate curbing, making a neat edge truly at
right angles to the edge of the pavement and truly vertical. Integral curbing,
which is that type placed with the pavement and molded as an integral part of
it, must be removed for the full depth from the top of curb to the bottom of
the pavement. The edge must be cut as above described. No combined curb and
gutter, straight curb or integral curb shall be removed within five feet of a
public crosswalk.
      (12)   The curb cut shall be made only by city employees or a contractor
approved by the Superintendent of Streets.
      (13)   At the request of the homeowner, the city will excavate the area
to be used as a residential driveway that lies within the street right of way.
All dirt excavated by the city shall be the property of the city and shall be
removed by the city at no charge to the homeowner.
      (14)   In the event at a homeowner desires to construct a residential
driveway of gravel and purchases all materials for the construction of the
driveway, then at the request of the homeowner, the city will provide the labor
necessary to construct that part of the driveway that lies within the street
right of way.
   (B)   Where driveways cross open ditches in the parkways, culverts shall be
installed. The culverts shall be of such length and shall be constructed of
such diameter and shall be constructed of such material as determined by the
Department of Public Works, depending on the conditions existing. In no
instance shall the size of opening be less than that obtained by a 12-inch
diameter pipe. The length of culvert shall be determined by the following
method; for ditch depth of 2 feet or less the culvert shall extend not less
than 5 feet beyond both edges of the driveway where it crosses the ditch. For
each additional foot depth of ditch add 2 feet to the above figure, except that
no culvert shall be less than 20 feet long and except that where headwalls are
constructed at the ends of the culvert the length shall be as determined by the
Department of Public Works.
   (C)   Where existing meter pits are in the area of a proposed driveway, the
existing cast iron top shall be removed and turned in to the Water Department.
A heavier cover shall be furnished and set by the Water Department, and the
additional cost thereof shall be paid by the property owner.
   (D)   All driveways constructed or reconstructed over, across or upon any
public street or public parkway in the city shall be kept and maintained at all
times in accordance with the provisions hereof by the persons so constructing,
reconstructing or using the same as an adjunct or appurtenance to lands or
properties immediately adjacent thereto.

§ 97.037 TILE INSTALLATION; ROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   In an area zoned residential, either R1, R2 or R3, wherever a street
or roadway has been furnished with a ditch or waterway for drainage the
adjacent property owner may request the Superintendent of Streets to determine
whether or not a tile may be installed in the ditch or waterway which tile will
provide for adequate continuation of the drainage through the road right-of-
way.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to alter the
grade of the ditch in a road right-of-way without having obtained a permit as
herein required, or without complying with the provisions of this section or in
violation of or variance from the terms of any such permit.
   (C)   Application for such permits shall be made by the adjacent property
owner with the Superintendent of Streets, and shall describe the location of
the intended alteration of the grade of the ditch in the road right-of-way, and
the person, firm or corporation doing the actual work and the name of the
person, firm or corporation for whom or which the work is being done, and shall
contain an agreement that the applicant will comply with all ordinances and
laws relating to the work to be done.
   (D)   No such permit shall be issued unless and until the applicant
therefore has deposited with the city, a cash deposit in the sum of $500 to
insure payment of the cost of the tile, to insure the proper restoration of the
ground and to insure the compliance with all ordinance and laws relating to the
work to be done. From this deposit should be deducted the expense to the city
for the purchase of any tile installed pursuant to the terms of the permit.
Also, from this deposit shall be deducted the expense to the city of relaying
the surface of the ground and of making the refill if this is done by the city
or at its expense. The balance shall be returned to the applicant without
interest after the work has been completed and the surface is restored.
   (E)   In an area zoned residential, either R1, R2 or R3, and if the
Superintendent of Streets determines that a tile may be installed, the city
shall install, at the request of the adjacent property owner, the tile in the
road right-of-way. The cost of the tile (but not the installation thereof)
shall be paid by the adjacent land owner to the city. The city will provide the
labor to install the tile at its sole expense.
   (F)   If any sidewalk or driveway is damaged or must be reconstructed as a
result of the work undertaken the cost thereof shall be paid by the applicant.
   (G)   The applicant shall, within 30 days of the installation of the tile,
back fill the portion of the road right-of-way that is not paved with dirt,
free from lumps and stone, thoroughly compacted around the tile. Such back fill
shall be done in a manner that will permit the restoration of the surface with
grass. Thereafter the applicant will seed the restored area with grass.
   (H)   The Superintendent of Streets shall from time to time and inspect or
cause to be inspected the work area to see to the enforcement of the provisions
of this section. The Superintendent of Streets shall have the authority to
promulgate and cause to be enforced such rules and regulations as may be
reasonably necessary to enforce and carry out the intent of this section.
   (I)   (1)   All work covered under this section to be accomplished by the
applicant shall be accomplished expeditiously until completion, in order to
avoid unnecessary inconvenience to traffic, to pedestrians, and for the
protection of other public interests. The applicant shall state, in his or her
application for the permit time, the number of days which he or she estimates
will be required to complete his or her work. Upon review of the application,
the Superintendent of Streets shall have the right to amend the time requested
and issue the permit so as to allow the minimum amount of time which he or she
determines will reasonably be required for such work. The time allowed for
completion shall be extended as necessary if it is found that it is not
possible to complete the work within the time allowed.
      (2)   In the event the work is not being accomplished expeditiously and
accordance with the time period set forth in the permit, or if work has ceased
or is abandoned without due cause, the Superintendent of Streets may, after 24
hours written notice to the applicant of the city's intention to do so, have
city forces correct said work, backfill the ditch in the road right-of-way, and
effect all restoration as required by this section.
      (3)   In the event that city forces accomplish work in accordance with
this division, the entire cost of such work, including any materials used
therefor, shall be paid to the city by the applicant upon demand or, at the
request of the applicant, can be deducted from the deposit made by the
applicant. If the deposit made by the applicant is not sufficient to pay said
costs the city may proceed to collect any of said cost due and owing in any
manner allowed by law.
   (J)   (1)   By reason of the grant of the permit, the city does not assume
any liability:
         (a)   For injuries to person, damage to property, or loss of service
claims; or
         (b)   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance or operation of equipment by applicant.
      (2)   By accepting a permit, the applicant is required to defend,
indemnify, and hold the city whole and harmless from all costs, liabilities,
and claims for damages of any kind arising out of the construction, presence,
installation, maintenance, repair or operation of its equipment, or out of any
activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether or not any act or
omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by the permit. The
applicant further agrees that the applicant will not bring, nor cause to be
brought, any action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any
other relief against the city for any claim nor for any award arising out of
the presence, installation, maintenance or operation of applicant's equipment,
or any activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether nor not the act
or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the permit.
The foregoing does not indemnify the city for its own negligence except for
claims arising out of or alleging the city's negligence where such negligence
arises out of or is primarily related to the presence, installation,
construction, operation, maintenance or repair of said equipment by the
applicant or on the applicant's behalf, including, but not limited to, the
issuance of permits and the inspection of plans or work. This section is not,
as to third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to
the applicant or to the city; and the applicant, in defending any action on
behalf of the city shall be entitled to assert in any action every defense or
immunity that the city could assert in its own behalf.

excavated material without using part of the adjacent sidewalk, a passageway at
least one-half of the sidewalk width shall be maintained along such sidewalk
line.
(Ord. 78-30, passed 8-31-78)
§ 97.060 RELOCATION AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES.
   The permittee shall not interfere with any existing facility without the
written consent of the Superintendent of Streets and the owner of the facility.
If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing facility this shall be done by
its owner. No facility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the
permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee. The cost of
moving privately owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee
unless it makes other arrangements with the person owning the facility. The
permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes,
conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by
the excavation work and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect
them under, over, along or across the work. The permittee shall secure approval
of method of support and protection from the owner of the facility. In case any
of the pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, and for
this purpose pipe coating or other encasement or devices are to be considered
as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly notify the owner
thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the agency or person
owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee.
It is the intent of this section that permittee shall assume all liability for
damage to facilities and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of
such facility damage and such assumption of liability is a contractual
obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be such instances where
damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the owning utility. The city
shall not be made a party to any action because of this section. The permittee
shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground
facilities and protect the same against damage.

   Whenever the use of a substructure is abandoned, except the abandonment of
service lines designed to serve single properties, the person owning, using,
controlling or having an interest therein shall within 30 days after such
abandonment file with the Superintendent of Streets a statement in writing
giving in detail the location of the substructure so abandoned. If such
abandoned substructure is in the way, or subsequently becomes in the way, of an
installation of the city or any other public body, which installation is
pursuant to a governmental function, the owner shall remove such abandoned
substructure or pay the cost of its removal during the course of excavation for
construction of the facility by the city or any other public body.
(Ord. 78-30, passed 8-31-78; Am. Ord. 03-02, passed 1-13-03)
§ 97.062 PROTECTION OF ADJOINING PROPERTY.
   The permittee shall at all times and at his, her or its own expense preserve
and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations
and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of
such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of
taking appropriate protecting measures, the permittee shall obtain consent from
the owner of such private property for such purpose and if he or she cannot
obtain such consent, the Superintendent of Streets may authorize him or her to
enter the private premises solely for the purpose of making the property safe.
The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings,
walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the
excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private
property or highways resulting from its failure properly to protect and carry
out the work. Whenever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through
any lawn area the area shall be reseeded or the sod shall be carefully cut and
tolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as required in this
section. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner
calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition
as nearly as possible to that which existed before such work began. The
permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist
in parking strip areas without first obtaining the consent of the appropriate
city department or city official having supervision of such property.

§ 97.063 CARE OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
   (A)   All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench
or in any street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to
endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the Superintendent of Streets shall have
the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a
storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling.
It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the necessary permission
and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal
sites.
   (B)   All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably
possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic or as specified by the
Superintendent of Streets. Whenever necessary, in order to expedite the flow of
traffic or to abate the dirt or dust nuisance, toe boards or bins may be
required by the Superintendent of Streets to prevent the spreading of dirt into
traffic lanes.

   As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleaned
of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work.
All clean up operations at the location of such excavation shall be
accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent of Streets. From time to time, as may be
ordered by the Superintendent of Streets and in any event immediately after
completion of the work, the permittee shall, at his, her or its own expense,
clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from
the work, and upon failure to do so within 24 hours after having been notified
to do so by the Superintendent of Streets, the work may be done by the
Superintendent of Public Works and the cost thereof charged to the permittee
and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof.

§ 97.065 PROTECTION OF WATERCOURSES.
   The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the full
depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of
such curb at the gutter line. Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting street,
an adequate waterway shall be provided and at all times maintained. The
permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, mulk, silt,
slickings or other run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing
or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its
failure to so provide.
(Ord. 78-30, passed 8-31-78)
§ 97.066 BREAKING THROUGH PAVEMENT.
   (A)   Heavy duty pavement breakers may be prohibited by the Superintendent
of Streets when the use endangers existing substructures or other property.
   (B)   Saw cutting or Portland cement concrete may be required when the
nature of the work or the condition of the street warrants. When required, the
depth of the cut shall be not less than one inch in depth; however, depths
greater than one inch may be required by the Superintendent of Streets when
circumstances warrant. Saw cutting may be required by the Superintendent of
Streets outside of the limits of the excavation over cave-outs, overbreaks and
small floating sections.
   (C)   Approved cutting of bituminous pavement surface ahead of excavations
may be required by the Superintendent of Streets to confine pavement damage to
the limits of the trench.
   (D)   Sections of sidewalks shall be removed to the nearest score line or
joint.
   (E)   Unstable pavement shall be removed over cave-outs and overbreaks and
the subgrade shall be treated as the main trench.
   (F)   Pavement edges shall be trimmed to a vertical face and neatly aligned
with the center line of the trench.
   (G)   Cutouts outside of the trench lines must be normal or parallel to the
trench line.
   (H)   Boring or other methods to prevent cutting of new pavement may be
required by the Superintendent of Streets.
   (I)   Permittee shall not be required to repair pavement damage existing
prior to excavation unless his or her cut results in small floating sections
that may be unstable, in which case the permittee shall remove and pave the
area.

§ 97.067 DEPTH OF STRUCTURES.
   No person shall, without written permission of the Superintendent of
Streets, install any substructure, except manholes, vaults, valve casings,
culverts and catch basins at a vertical distance less than:
   (A)   Streets:   24 inches below the established flow line of the nearest
gutter. If the flow line is not established, then the depth shall be at a
minimum of 24 inches below the surface of the nearest outermost edge of the
traveled portion of the street;
   (B)   Parkway:
      (1)   The minimum depth of any substructure shall be 16 inches below
established gutter grade when the substructure parallels the parkway;

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 99.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
chapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict. Without limiting the foregoing, §§ 97.105 through
97.126 are hereby repealed.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the city so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city
to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety
and welfare.

§ 99.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   City review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Director of
Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Director of Public Works shall reject such application in
writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Director of Public Works is
satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter
and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of
Public Works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the construction proposed
under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   Additional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, ILCS Ch. 220,
Act 65, § 4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it
intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the city not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work
requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of
work requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall specify the
portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and
constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide
such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either
ten days after service of notice to the city by the telecommunications retailer
in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or 25 days
after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
99.04 the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city an application
for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of division (A) of this section.
   (C)   Additional city review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable

holder has complied with applicable city codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(Ord. 08-05, passed 3-10-05)
§ 99.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 08-05, passed 3-10-08)
§ 99.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
99.21. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall
either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that
it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

99.99
§ 99.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. 
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the City of Paxton,
and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as
additional insureds on the policies listed in subdivisions (a) and (b) below:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to

with limits not less than:
            1.   $5,000,000 for bodily injury or death to each person;
            2.   $5,000,000 for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
            3.   $5,000,000 for all other types of liability;

contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies.  The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required.  The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. 
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the City of Paxton, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice addressed to the City of Paxton Mayor of such
intent to cancel or not to renew."
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no
event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A) of this section, or the requirements of divisions
(B), (C) and (D) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
division (A) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a private
self insurer under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.

99.99
§ 99.09 INDEMNIFICATION.

be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 08-05, passed 3-10-08)
§ 99.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14-day notice
period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
city that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee
shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division (C) of this
section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

99.99

deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the city within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
         (c)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-

      (2)   The city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the
time periods provided in this division.
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of this
section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) of this section, the city or its
designee may, at the option of the city:
      (1)   Correct the deficiencies;
      (2)   Upon not less than 20 days notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or
      (3)   After not less than 30 days notice to the permittee of failure to
cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the city. The

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility's expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the city police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the city a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after
an emergency repair.

§ 99.21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the Director of
Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Director of Public Works shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Director of Public Works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Director
of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to
appeal to the City Council, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City
Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The City Council shall commence its consideration of the appeal
at the Council's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days
after the filing of the appeal. The City Council shall timely decide the
appeal.

other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a special use permit or variance all as may apply in
conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the city zoning
ordinance.
      (10)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      (11)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way

not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an application
to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or
wireless support structure, and $350 for each small wireless facility addressed
in a consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless
facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures.
      (2)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000 for each small
wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of
a new utility pole for such collocation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this subchapter shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      (4)   The city shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless

consistent with division (B)(1) above; or
         (c)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung

      (5)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the city to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this subchapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      (1)   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the city or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      (2)   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      (3)   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under § 18c-7201 of the
Illinois Vehicle Code (ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 18c-7201), Metra Commuter Rail or
any other public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in §
16-102 of the Public Utilities Act (ILCS Ch. 220, Act 5, § 16-102), without the
consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility.
The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to an electric or gas public
utility or such utility’s wireless facilities if the facilities are being used,
developed and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of §
16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act (ILCS Ch. 220, Act 5, § 16-108.5(i)). For
the purposes of this division (E)(3), “public utility” has the meaning given to
that term in § 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act (ILCS Ch. 220, Act 5, § 3-
105). Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to relieve any person from
any requirement (a) to obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to
offer cable service or video service or (b) to obtain any required permission
to install, place, maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than
small wireless facilities subject to this subchapter.
   (F)   Pre-existing agreements.

facilities collocated on the city’s utility poles pursuant to applications
submitted to the city before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination
provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall
comply with this subchapter.

the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the
city makes available under this subchapter for the collocation of small
wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the
collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application
submitted two or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying
the city that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing
agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for
the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the
city’s utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the city before the
wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this
division (F)(2).

      (1)   A wireless provider shall pay to the city an annual recurring rate
to collocate a small wireless facility on a city utility pole located in a
right-of-way that equals (i) $200 per year or (ii) the actual, direct and
reasonable costs related to the wireless provider’s use of space on the city
utility pole.
      (2)   If the city has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct
costs, the fee shall be $200 payable on the first day after the first annual
anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to collocate, and
on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   (H)   Abandonment.
      (1)   A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous
period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the facility

written notice from the city notifying the wireless provider of the
abandonment.
      (2)   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the city to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days
of such notice, the city may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
      (3)   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the city if it
sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the
city. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new
wireless provider.

§ 99.33 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court of Champaign County, Illinois shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless
Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for
collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the
right-of-way, the city shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its
poles at annual rates of no more than $200 per year per municipal utility pole,
with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 2018-O-20, passed 7-19-18)
§ 99.34 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the city harmless against any
and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the city
improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless
provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted under this subchapter and the Act. A wireless provider has
no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses
as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the city or its employees
or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may
have against the city with respect to consequential, incidental, or special
damages, however caused, based on the theory of liability.
(Ord. 2018-O-20, passed 7-19-18)
§ 99.35 INSURANCE.
   (A)   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider’s own cost
and expense, the following insurance:
      (1)   Property insurance for its property’s replacement cost against all
risks;
      (2)   Workers’ compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      (3)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the city improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of city
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
   (B)   The wireless provider shall include the city as an additional insured
on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and
documentation of inclusion of the city in a commercial general liability policy
prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
   (C)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirement required by the city. A wireless provider that
self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply
with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage limits required by the city.
(Ord. 2018-O-20, passed 7-19-18)
§ 99.36 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this subchapter or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or applications of this subchapter that can
be given effect without the invalid application or provision, and each invalid
provision or invalid application of this subchapter is severable.
(Ord. 2018-O-20, passed 7-19-18)

   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in an amount of
not less than $50 nor more than $750 per day that such violations exists. There
may be times when the city will incur delay or other costs, including third
party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under
its permit and this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation
of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility
shall bear the city’s costs of damages and its costs of installing,
maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the
subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review
or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be
imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered TELECOMMUNICATIONS
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this section,

taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a
credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the
extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state
which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local
tax in this state.

§ 111.03 COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS.
   (A)   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.
(Ord. 02-35, passed 9-9-02)
§ 111.04 RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT.
   On or before the last day of February 2003, and on or before the last day of
every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this chapter on telecommunication
retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required
by the Department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified Municipal
Telecommunications Tax Act, ILCS Ch. 35, Act 636, §§ 5-1 et seq. and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to implement the
Act.
(Ord. 02-35, passed 9-9-02)
§ 111.05 RESELLERS.
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

   (C)   In evaluating an application for a new franchise, the city shall
consider the applicant’s character; the applicant’s technical, financial, and
legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the nature
of the proposed facilities, equipment, and services; the applicant’s record in

omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the franchise.
This provision includes, but is not limited to, claims arising out of copyright
infringements or a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from the
owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of programs to be delivered by
the cable system.
   (D)   The franchise agreement may require the franchisee to have in force at
all times a performance bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount as

§ 118.17 (RESERVED).
FRANCHISE REGULATIONS

this chapter must have a minimum capacity of 54 video channels available for
immediate or potential use and have the capability for two-way communications.
      (2)   A cable system may be required to provide one or more access
channels for public, educational or governmental access. In addition, the city
may require a franchisee to reserve one or more additional channels for present
or future access use. If the city determines that the use of existing access
facilities warrants the activation of such reserve channels, the franchisee
shall activate them upon 90 days’ notice from the city. The city may require in

access studios and related equipment and facilities.
      (3)   A cable system must provide leased access channels as required by
federal law.
      (4)   Service to public buildings may be required without charge as set
forth in the franchise agreement.
   (B)   Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, a franchisee must
make cable service available to every unserved dwelling within the franchise
service area. Where the franchise service area is the entire city, the
franchisee shall extend service to any annexed areas within six months of the
date of annexation; provided, however, the franchisee is not required to extend
service in areas where the cable would pass fewer than 30 homes per cable mile.
   (C)   The city may waive minimum requirements of this section where, in the
judgment of the city, such waiver is justified in the public interest.
(Ord. 89-15, passed 5-8-89)
§ 118.31 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, a franchisee, in
consideration of the privilege granted under a franchise for the use of public

of the franchisee’s gross revenues derived from the operation of its cable
system within the city during the period of its franchise. Franchise fees are
payable quarterly. A franchisee must pay the franchise fee due to the city for
the preceding quarter within 30 calendar days of the end of that quarter.
   (B)   Any payment of franchise fees to adjust for a shortfall in the
quarterly payments for the preceding year must be made no later than the filing
date for the annual financial statements. Adjustments for any overpayment will
be credited to subsequent quarterly payments.

payments shall be accompanied by a financial statement showing the gross
revenues received by the franchisee during the period covered by the payments

preparation of such financial statements.
   (E)   The city may inspect and audit any and all books and records of the
franchisee, and recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the
franchise. The cost of the audit will be borne by the franchisee if the annual
payment to the city is increased by more than 5% as a result of the audit.
   (F)   In the event that a franchise payment is not received by the city on
or before the due date, interest will be charged from the due date at an
interest rate of 1 1/2% per month. In addition, the franchisee will pay a late
charge of 5% of the amount of such payment. Interest and late charges will not
be imposed for any payment necessary as a result of the yearly adjustment
provided for in division (B) above, if the payment to correct for a shortfall
does not exceed 10% of the total payments made during the year. In the event
such payment exceeds 10% of the total payments made during the year, the
franchisee will be liable for interest and late charges for the entire amount
due.
   (G)   When a franchise terminates for whatever reason, the franchisee must
file with the city within 90 calendar days of the date its operations cease a
financial statement, audited by a CPA or certified by the franchisee’s chief
financial officer, showing the gross revenues received by the franchisee since

determines is reasonable pursuant to the process specified in §
118.43.

order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the city
determines are appropriate. The city shall not impose any remedy without first
giving the franchisee notice of the violation and a reasonable opportunity to
cure it.

§ 118.41 RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   If a franchisee decides to initiate a formal franchise renewal process
in accordance with Section 626(a) through (g) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546
(a) - (g), it must notify the city within 30 to 36 months of the franchise
expiration date. Upon such notification, or at the city’s own initiative, the
city must commence the following process:
      (1)   The city shall review and evaluate the future cable-related
community needs and interests and the franchisee’s past performance. The review
and evaluation process must include opportunity for public comment.
      (2)   Immediately upon completion of the review and evaluation process,
the city must notify the franchisee that it may file a renewal application. The
notice must specify the information to be included in the renewal application
and the deadline for filing the application, which must be no earlier than 30
calendar days following the date of the notice. If the franchisee does not
submit a renewal application by the specified date, it will be deemed not to be
seeking renewal of its franchise.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the renewal-application, the city shall publish
notice of its receipt and may schedule one or more public meetings or implement
other procedures under which comments from the public on the application may be
received.
   (B)   In considering a renewal application, the city must consider whether:
      (1)   The cable operator has substantially complied with the material
terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;
      (2)   The quality of the cable operator’s service, including signal
quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices (but without
regard to the mix, quality, or level of cable services or other services
provided over the system) has been reasonable in light of community needs;
      (3)   The cable operator has the financial, legal and technical ability
to provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in its proposal;
and
      (4)   The cable operator’s proposal is reasonable to meet the future
cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of
meeting such needs and interests.
   (C)   The Council shall hold at least one public hearing to consider the
application. An advisory committee or a committee of the Council may make
recommendations to the Council prior to its consideration, a copy of which
recommendations shall be made available to the franchisee in advance of the
Council’s consideration. Following the public hearing on the renewal
application, the Council must either:
      (1)   Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, subject to the
negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the city and the
franchisee, or
      (2)   Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the
franchise should not be renewed.
   (D)   The Council’s action under division (C) above must be taken within
four months of the date of the renewal application notice to the franchisee
required in division (A)(2) above.
   (E)   If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be
renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the city
must commence an administrative proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of
the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c).
   (F)   The city shall commence an administrative proceeding, initiated by a
hearing order which establishes the issues to be addressed in the hearing and
the procedures to be followed and appoints a presiding officer for the hearing.
Upon the completion of the hearing, the presiding officer shall issue a
recommended decision. Parties to the hearing and the public shall have 30
calendar days to comment on the recommended decision after its issuance.
   (G)   Based on the recommended decision, the comment and arguments
presented, and other evidence of record, the Council, following a public
hearing, shall make a final determination on whether to grant or deny the
renewal application. The Council shall issue a written decision setting forth
the reasons for its decision.
   (H)   The provisions of divisions (A) through (G) above notwithstanding, a
franchisee may submit a proposal for renewal of a franchise in accordance with
47 U.S.C. § 546(h). The city must hold one or more public hearings or implement
other procedures under which comments on the proposal from the public may be
received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the Council shall
determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions
of any renewal. In making its determination the Council shall not consider the
pendency of any other application for a franchise.
   (I)   Once the Council grants a renewal application, the city and the
franchisee must agree on a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures
specified in divisions (E) through (J) of §
118.15, before the renewal becomes effective.
   (J)   If renewal of a franchise is denied, the city may acquire ownership of
the cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another
person upon the agreement of the owner of the facilities and approval of the
Council. Any such acquisition by the city must be at fair market value,
determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with
no value allocated to the franchise itself.
   (K)   If renewal of a franchise is denied and the city does not purchase the
cable system, the city may require the former franchisee to remove its
facilities and equipment. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a
reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former
franchisee’s and/or surety’s expense.
(Ord. 89-15, passed 5-8-89)

   (A)   A transfer of a franchise must not occur without prior approval of the
city.
   (B)   An application to transfer a franchise must meet the requirements of §
118.14 and provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including
details on the legal, character, financial, technical and other pertinent
qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer
on subscriber rates. At minimum, the information required in §
118.14(E)(l) through (4) must be provided by the proposed transferee. The
information required in §
118.14(E)(5) through (10) must also be provided whenever the proposed
transferee expects material changes to occur in those areas. Transfer
applications should be filed at least 90 days prior to the anticipated date of
the proposed transaction.
   (C)   Final action on an application for transfer of a franchise must be
taken by the Council. In making a determination on such an application, the
Council will consider the legal, financial, technical and character
qualifications of the transferee to operate the system and whether operation by
the transferee would adversely affect the cable services to subscribers or
otherwise be contrary to the public interest.
   (D)   Approval by the city of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute
a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this chapter or the
franchise agreement.
(Ord. 89-15, passed 5-8-89)
§ 118.43 REVOCATION OR TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   A franchise may be revoked by the Council for failure to construct as
required, operate or maintain the cable system as required by this chapter or
the franchise agreement or for other material breach of this chapter or the
franchise agreement. However, where the city has issued a franchise
specifically conditioned upon the completion of construction or other specific
obligation by a specified date pursuant to §
118.15(B), failure of the franchisee to complete construction or comply with
other specific obligation as required will result in the automatic forfeiture
of the franchise without further action by the city, unless the city, at its
discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an
extension of time. If within 30 calendar days following written notice from the
city to the franchisee that it is in material breach of this chapter or the
franchise agreement, the franchisee has not taken corrective action or
corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the Council,
acting on its own motion or upon the recommendation of the Mayor, may give
written notice to the franchisee of its intent to consider revocation of the
franchise or reducing its term, stating its reasons.
   (B)   Before final action can be taken, the Council shall hold a public
hearing at which time the franchisee and members of the public must be given an
opportunity to present evidence and make argument. Following the public hearing
the Council shall determine whether or not to revoke the franchise or reduce
its term based on any recommended decision, the evidence and argument presented
at the hearing, and other evidence of record. The Council’s determination shall
be reflected in a written opinion setting forth the reasons for its decision.
   (C)   Any franchise may, at the option of the city, be revoked 120 calendar
days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that 120-day period:
      (1)   Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or
      (2)   Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and has
executed an agreement, approved by the court having jurisdiction, assuming and
agreeing to be bound by the terms, and conditions of the franchise.
   (D)   In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the
facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke the
franchise by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at
the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the
franchise will be revoked 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless:
      (1)   The city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the
successful bidder; and
      (2)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise.
   (E)   If the city revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a
franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its
subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective:
      (1)   The city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities
and equipment. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable
period of time, the city may have the removal done at the franchisee’s and/or
surety’s expense.
      (2)   The city, by resolution of the Council may acquire ownership of the
cable system at an equitable price.
      (3)   If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the city may sell,
assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system.
   (F)   The city may, upon resolution of the Council, acquire ownership of and
operate a cable system, whether or not such ownership is acquired following
revocation or forfeiture of a franchise.

§ 118.44 ARBITRATION.
   (A)   If the city exercises a right to purchase a cable system pursuant to
this chapter or a franchise agreement and the city and franchisee are unable to
agree on a price for the purchase of the system, the price may be determined by
arbitration. Other matters that are arbitrable under the provisions of a
franchise agreement may be subjected to the arbitration procedures specified
below.
   (B)   The arbitration procedure employed shall be consistent with the rules
and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. The city and the
franchisee will each select a qualified arbitrator. The two persons selected
shall select a third qualified arbitrator, and the three arbitrators will
constitute a panel whose decision is binding on both parties. The fees of the
first two arbitrators shall be paid by the party selecting such person, and the
third person shall be compensated one-half by the city and one-half by the
franchisee. The general costs of the proceeding shall be shared equally by the
city and the franchisee.

from the franchisee as long as their financial and other obligations to the
franchisee are satisfied.

whatever reason, the franchisee must do everything in its power to ensure that
all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted, service regardless of the
circumstances. The franchisee must cooperate with the city to operate the
system for a temporary period following termination or transfer as necessary to
maintain continuity of service to all subscribers. The temporary period will
not exceed six months without the franchisee’s written consent. During such
period the cable system must be operated under such terms and conditions as the
city and the franchisee may agree, or such other terms and conditions that will
continue, to the extent possible, the same level of service to subscribers and
that will provide reasonable compensation to the cable operator.
   (C)   If the franchisee discontinues service to its subscribers without city
approval, the franchise may immediately be terminated, and the city is
empowered to occupy and take possession of all facilities and property, real
and personal, related to the cable system for the purpose of temporarily
operating the system. The city may undertake such, operation itself or
authorize operation by a contractor.

standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or

dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is

or scientific value.

shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was

   (D)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement, or
possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

judged with reference to average children of the same general age of the child
to whom such material was sold, lent, distributed or given, unless it appears
from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its dissemination or
distribution that it is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which

passed 10-11-22)
§ 138.03 SEIZURE; IMPOUNDMENT.
   Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle
is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to §
138.02, such police officer shall provide for the towing of such motor vehicle
to a facility designated by the city. Before or at the time the motor vehicle
is towed, the police officer shall notify the owner of record or the person in
control of the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, whichever is
present if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and impoundment
and of the right of the owner of record to request a vehicle impoundment
hearing under this chapter.
(Ord. 09-29, passed 8-10-09)
§ 138.04 NOTICE.
   Within 72 hours after a motor vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to §
138.03, the Police Department shall notify by certified mail the owner of
record and any lien holder of record of the fact of the seizure and impoundment
and the right to request a motor vehicle impoundment hearing under this
chapter. However, no such notice need be sent to the owner of record if the
owner of record is personally served with the notice at the time the motor
vehicle is seized and impounded and the owner of record acknowledges receipt of
such notice in writing. A copy of such notice shall be forwarded to the hearing
officer. The notice shall state the penalties that may be imposed if no hearing
is requested, including that a motor vehicle not released by payment of the
administrative penalty and applicable towing and storage fees may be sold or
disposed of by the city in accordance with applicable law.
(Ord. 09-29, passed 8-10-09)
§ 138.05 HEARING.
   (A)   The owner of record seeking a vehicle impoundment hearing shall file a
written request for such a hearing with the Police Department of the city no
later than 15 days after notice was mailed or otherwise given to the owner of
record under §
138.03 or
138.04 of this chapter. The hearing date shall be no more than ten calendar
days after a request for a vehicle impoundment hearing has been filed.
   (B)   (1)   If, after the vehicle impoundment hearing, the hearing officer
determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle was used
in the violation, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of
record liable to the city for the amount of the administrative penalty
prescribed, plus applicable towing and storage fees payable to the towing
agent.
      (2)   If, after a hearing, the hearing officer does not determine by a
preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle was used in such a
violation, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding for the owner of
record and for the return of the motor vehicle and any previously paid
administrative penalty and applicable towing and storage fees; provided that if
the motor vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to state or federal drug
asset forfeiture laws, the motor vehicle shall not be returned unless and until
the city receives notice from the appropriate state, or where applicable,
federal officials that:
         (a)   Forfeiture proceedings will not be instituted; or
         (b)   Forfeiture proceedings have concluded and there is a settlement
or a court order providing that the motor vehicle shall be returned to the
owner of record.
   (C)   If the owner of record requests a vehicle impoundment hearing but
fails to appear at such hearing or fails to request a vehicle impoundment
hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record shall be deemed to have waiver
his or her right to such a hearing and the hearing officer shall enter a
default order in favor of the city for the amount of the administrative penalty
prescribed, plus applicable towing and storage fees payable to the towing
agent.
   (D)   However, if the owner of record pays such administrative penalty and
applicable towing and storage fees and the motor vehicle is returned to the
owner of record, no default order need be entered if the owner of record is
informed of his or her right to a hearing and signs a written waiver, in which
case an order of liability shall be deemed to have been made when the city
receives the written waiver.
(Ord. 09-29, passed 8-10-09)
§ 138.06 HEARING OFFICER; PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   The Mayor or his or her designee shall serve as the hearing officer

   (B)   All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at any vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not
apply at any such hearing.
   (C)   Any sworn or affirmed report, including a report prepared in
compliance with Section 11-501.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5, § 11-501.1) that (1) is prepared in the performance of a law enforcement
officer’s duties and (2) sufficiently describes the circumstances leading to
the impoundment, shall be admissible evidence of the owner of record’s
liability under §
138.02 of this chapter, and shall support a finding of the owner of record’s
liability under §
138.02 of this chapter, unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.
(Ord. 09-29, passed 8-10-09)
§ 138.07 DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLE.
   (A)   An administrative penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter shall
constitute a debt due and owing the city which may be enforced in any manner
provided by law.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a motor vehicle
impounded pursuant to this chapter shall remain impounded until:
      (1)   The administrative penalty is paid in full to the city, and all
applicable towing and storage fees are paid to the towing agent, in which case
the owner of record shall be given possession of the motor vehicle;
      (2)   A cash bond in the amount of $500 is posted with the City
Comptroller or Police Department, and all applicable towing and storage fees
are paid to the towing agent, at which time the motor vehicle shall be released

      (3)   The motor vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a
judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, whenever a person
with a lien or record against a motor vehicle impounded under this chapter has
commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the motor vehicle shall be
given to that person if he or she pays the applicable towing and storage fees
and agrees in writing to refund to the city the net proceeds of any foreclosure
sale, less any amounts necessary to pay all lien holders of record, for the
total amount of administrative penalties imposed under this chapter.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no vehicle that
was seized and impounded pursuant to state or federal drug asset forfeiture
laws shall be returned to the owner of record unless and until the city has
received notice from the appropriate state, or where applicable, federal
officials that:
      (1)   Forfeiture proceedings will not be instituted; or
      (2)   Forfeiture proceedings have concluded and there is a settlement or
a court order providing that the vehicle shall be returned to the owner of
record.

§ 138.08 POSTING OF BOND.
   (A)   If a cash bond in the amount of $500 is posted with the City
Comptroller, the impounded motor vehicle shall be released to the owner of
record upon the payment of any applicable towing and storage fees to the towing
agent.
   (B)   If an administrative penalty is imposed for any violation under §
138.02, the $500 cash bond will be forfeited to the city; however, in the event
a violation under §
138.02 is not proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the $500 cash bond
will be returned to the person posting the bond.
   (C)   All bond money to be forfeited to the city pursuant to this section
shall be held by the City Comptroller until 30 days after an administrative
penalty is imposed by the hearing officer under this chapter, or, if there is a
judicial review, until a final judgment is rendered by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
(Ord. 09-29, passed 8-10-09)
§ 138.09 FAILURE TO PAY PENALTY.
   If the administrative penalty and applicable towing and storage fees are not
paid within 30 days after an administrative penalty is imposed under this
chapter against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the
vehicle impoundment hearing, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative penalty and
applicable towing and storage fees are not paid within 30 days after the
expiration of time at which administrative review of the hearing officer’s
determination may be sought, or within 30 days after an action seeking
administrative review has been resolved in favor of the city, whichever is
applicable, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed
of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles;
provided that, if the motor vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to state
or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the motor vehicle may not be disposed of
by the city, except as consistent with those proceedings.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The prime tool of planning is land use control, most commonly referred to as
zoning. The purposes of zoning are many, but foremost among these are:
   (A)   To promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, morals and
general welfare of the people;
   (B)   To divide the city into zones or districts, restricting and regulating
therein the location, erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration and
use of buildings, structures and land for residence, business and manufacturing
and other specified uses;
   (C)   To protect the character and the stability of the residential,
business and manufacturing areas within the city, and to promote the orderly
and beneficial development of such areas;
   (D)   To provide adequate light, air, privacy and convenience of access to
property;
   (E)   To regulate the intensity of use of lot areas, and to determine the
area of open spaces surrounding buildings, necessary to provide adequate light
and air and to protect the public health;
   (F)   To establish building lines and the location of buildings designed for
residential, business, manufacturing or other uses within such areas;
   (G)   To fix reasonable standards to which buildings or structures shall
conform therein;
   (H)   To prohibit uses, buildings or structures incompatible with the
character of development or intended uses within specified zoning districts;
   (I)   To prevent additions to, or alteration or remodeling of, existing

mounted systems other than a flat roof the elevation must show the highest
finished slope of the solar collector and the slope of the finished roof
surface on which it is mounted.
            2.   Flat roof mounted solar energy systems. For flat roof
applications a drawing shall be submitted showing the distance to the roof edge
and any parapets on the building and shall identify the height of the building
on the street frontage side, the shortest distance of the system from the
street frontage edge of the building, and the highest finished height of the
solar collector above the finished surface of the roof.
         (b)   Plan approvals. Applications that meet the design requirements
of this section, and do not require an administrative variance, shall be
granted administrative approval by the Director of Community Development and
shall not require Planning and Zoning Committee review. Plan approval does not
indicate compliance with Building Code or Electric Code.
   (H)   Approved solar components. Electric solar energy system components
must have a UL listing or approved equivalent and solar hot water systems must
have an SRCC rating.
   (I)   Compliance with Building Code. All active solar energy systems shall
meet approval of county building code officials, consistent with the State of
Illinois Building Code and solar thermal system shall comply with HVAC-related
requirements of the Energy Code. Any county adopted building codes will apply
and take precedence where applicable.
   (J)   Compliance with State Electric Code. All photovoltaic systems shall
comply with the Illinois State Electric Code.
   (K)   Compliance with State Plumbing Code. Solar thermal systems shall
comply with applicable Illinois State Plumbing Code requirements.
   (L)   Compliance with State Energy Code. All photovoltaic systems and solar
thermal systems shall comply with the Illinois State Energy Code.
   (M)   Utility notification. All grid-intertie solar energy systems shall
comply with the interconnection requirements of the electric utility. Off-grid
systems are exempt from this requirement.
   (N)   Principal uses. Ford County encourages the development of commercial
or utility scale solar energy systems where such systems present few land use
conflicts with current and future development patterns. Ground-mounted solar
energy systems that are the principal use on the zoning lot or lots are special
uses in selected districts.
   (O)   Rooftop gardens permitted. Rooftop community systems are permitted in
all zoning districts where buildings are permitted.
   (P)   Ground-mount gardens. Ground-mount community solar energy gardens must
be less than 20 acres in total size. Ground-mount solar developments covering
more than 20 acres shall be considered solar farms.
   (Q)   Stormwater solar gardens are subject to the city's stormwater
management regulations, erosion and sediment control provisions.
   (R)   Interconnection. An interconnection agreement must be completed with
the electric utility in whose service territory the system is located prior to

   (S)   Aviation protection. For solar gardens located within 500 feet of an
airport or within approach zones of an airport, the applicant must complete and
provide the results of the Solar Glare Hazard Analysis Tool (SGHAT) for the
airport traffic control tower cab and final approach paths, consistent with the
Interim Policy, FAA Review of Solar Energy Projects on Federally Obligated
Airports, or most recent version adopted by the FAA.
   (T)   Other standards. 
      (1)   Ground-mount systems must comply with all required standards for
structures in the district in which the system is located. All solar gardens
shall also be in compliance with all applicable local, state and federal
regulatory codes, including the State of Illinois Uniform Building Code, as
amended; and the National Electric Code, as amended. Also, Health Department
requirements for wells and septic systems must be met.
      (2)   For solar farms. Ground-mount solar energy systems that are the
primary use on the lot, designed for providing energy to off-site uses or
export to the wholesale market, are permitted under the following standards:
         (a)   Special use permit. Solar farms are special uses in the
agricultural district.
         (b)   Stormwater. Solar farms are subject to the city's stormwater
management regulations, erosion and sediment control provisions.
         (c)   Ground cover and buffer areas. Top soils shall not be removed
during development, unless part of a remediation effort. Soils shall be planted
to and maintained in perennial vegetation to prevent erosion, manage run off
and build soil. The city has a noxious weed ordinance which is to be followed
subject to the allowance of the planting of pollinator plants as otherwise
provided under this section. Due to potential liability under the Illinois
Endangered Species Protection Act (520 ILCS 10/11(b)) it is required that any
crops planted be in compliance with all federal and state laws protecting
endangered species. This will also include pollinators such as bees.
         (d)   Foundations. A qualified engineer shall certify that the
foundation and design of the solar panels racking and support is within
accepted professional standards, given local soil and climate conditions.
         (e)   Other standards and codes. All solar farms shall be in

including the State of Illinois Uniform Building Code, as amended; and the
National Electric Code, as amended.
         (f)   Power and communication lines. Power and communication lines
running between banks of solar panels and to nearby electric substations or
interconnections with buildings shall be buried underground. Exemptions may be
granted by the city in instances where shallow bedrock, water courses, or other
elements of the natural landscape interfere with the ability to bury lines, or
distance makes undergrounding infeasible, at the discretion of the City
Superintendent in consultation with the Mayor.
In addition, the Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDOA) has established
standards and policies in the Agricultural Impact Mitigation Agreements (AIMA)
regarding the construction or burial of electric transmission lines which
should be agreed to and adhered to between the landowner and the developer.
         (g)   Site plan required. A detailed site plan for both existing and
proposed conditions must be submitted, showing location of all solar arrays,
other structures, property lines, rights-of-way, service roads, floodplains,
wetlands and other protected natural resources, topography, farm tile, electric
equipment, fencing, and screening materials and all other characteristics
requested by the city. The site plan should also show all zoning districts, and
overlay districts. The city will retain the authority to suspend any
requirement for any studies or plans for purposes of permit approval so long as
such studies and/or plans are completed and approved by time of construction.
         (h)   Aviation protection. For approach zones of an airport, the
applicant must complete and provide the results of the Solar Glare Hazard
Analysis Tool (SGHAT) for the airport traffic control tower cab and final
approach paths, consistent with the Interim Policy, FAA Review of Solar Energy
Projects on Federally Obligated Airports, or most recent version adopted by the
FAA.
   (U)   Liability insurance and indemnification.
      (1)   For solar farms and solar gardens, commencing with the issuance of
building permits, the applicant, owner, or operator shall maintain a current
general liability policy covering bodily injury and property damage with limits
of at least $3,000,000 per occurrence and $5,000,000 in the aggregate. Such
insurance may be provided pursuant to a plan of self-insurance, by a party with
a net worth of $20,000,000 or more. The city shall be named as an individual
insured on the policy to the extent the city is entitled to indemnification.
      (2)   For private/individual SES(s), commencing with the issuance of
building permits, the applicant or owner shall maintain a current liability
policy covering bodily injuries and any damage that may occur, on their home
owner's policy or other applicable policy as approved by the Director of
Community Development.
      (3)   Any SES(s), applicant, owner, or operator, whether individual or
commercial, shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the county and its
officials, employees, and agents (collectively and individually, the
"Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all claims, demands, losses,
suits, causes of actions, damages, injuries, costs, expenses, and liabilities
whatsoever, including reasonable attorney's fees, except to the extent arising
in whole or part out of negligence or intentional acts of such indemnified
parties (such liabilities together known as "liability") arising out of
applicant, owner, or operators selection, construction, operation, and removal
of the SES(S) and affiliated equipment including, without limitation, liability
for property damage or personal injury (including death), whether said
liability is premised on contract or on tort (including without limitation
strict liability or negligence). This general indemnification shall not be
construed as limited or qualifying the county's other indemnification rights
available under the law.
   (V)   Decommissioning.
      (1)   A decommissioning plan shall be required to be submitted when
applying for all solar farms and solar gardens, to ensure that facilities are
properly removed after their useful life.
      (2)   Decommissioning of solar panels must occur in the event they are
not in use for 180 consecutive days.
      (3)   The owner or operator will have six months to complete the
decommissioning plan after operation of a solar farm or solar garden stops
operations.
      (4)   The decommissioning plan shall include provisions for removal of
all structures and foundations, restoration of soil and vegetation and a plan
ensuring financial resources will be available to fully decommission the site.
      (5)   The city may require the posting of a bond, letter of credit or the
establishment of an escrow account to ensure the proper decommissioning. The
posting of a bond may be required prior to the issuance of a building permit
for the facility.
      (6)   In the event that the State of Illinois enacts a law with regards
to the decommissioning of a solar farm, the strictest requirements shall
prevail.
      (7)   Failure by an owner or operator to comply with this section shall
entitle the city to issue a notice of noncompliance giving the owner or
operator 45 days from date of issuance to comply with this section prior to the
city taking further action. Such notice shall be deemed effective when mailed
by first class mail to the billing address for real estate taxes or the last
known business address of the owner or operator and when posted at an entryway
of the premises. Failure by the city to properly and/or timely issue such
notice shall not limit the city's ability to enforce this section and shall not
release the owner or operator from its obligation to comply with this section.

aggregate increase in units of measurement shall equal to not less than 15% of
the units of measurement existing upon the effective date of this chapter, in
which event parking or loading facilities as required, shall be provided for
the total increase.
      (4)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking and loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use. However, if the said building or
structure was erected prior to the effective date of this chapter, additional
parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the
requirements for the new use would exceed those for the existing use if the
latter were subject to the parking and loading provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking
or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use
served and which were in existence on the effective date of this chapter or
were provided voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be
reduced below, or if already less than, shall not further be reduced below, the
requirements of this chapter for a similar new building or use.
   (C)   Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading
facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings provided that all
regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement, and operation
of such facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this chapter,
which subsequent thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion,
or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-
street parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that parking
or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage
or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or
construction.
   (E)   Control of off-site parking facilities. When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are accessory. No such off-site parking
facilities shall be authorized and no occupancy permit shall be issued where
the plans call for parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot until
and unless the Plan Commission has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant
and made findings that the common ownership or possession of the zoning lot and
the site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue and that
the off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life
of the proposed use or building.
   (F)   Submission of plot plans. Any application for a building permit or for
a certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required, shall include
therewith a plot plan - drawn to scale and fully dimensioned - showing any
parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance herewith.

Commission to be the Central Business District the parking regulations set
forth herein shall not apply. However, existing off-street parking in the
Central Business District which is located on the same lot as the building or
use served and which was in existence on the effective date of this chapter or
was provided voluntarily after the date of this chapter, shall not hereafter be
reduced below the requirements of this chapter for a similar new building or
use.
   (A)   Use of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities accessory to
residential uses and developed in any residential district in accordance with
the requirements herein shall be used solely for the parking of passenger
automobiles owned by occupants of the dwelling structures to which such
facilities are accessory or by guests of said occupants. Under no circumstances
shall required parking facilities accessory to residential structures be used
for the storage of commercial vehicles or for the parking of automobiles
belonging to the employees, owners, tenants, visitors, or customers of business
or manufacturing establishments.
   (B)   Joint parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different
buildings, structures or uses or for mixed uses may be provided collectively in
any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each constituent
use would be permitted, provided that the total number of spaces so located
together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements for each
use.
   (C)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required herein results in a requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess of
one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
   (D)   Size. A required off-street parking space shall be at least ten feet
in width and at least 20 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles,
ramps, columns or office or work areas. Such space shall have a vertical
clearance of at least seven feet.
   (E)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly
upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street
parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access
to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic
movements. No driveway across public property nor curb cut shall exceed a width
of 30 feet.
   (F)   In yards. Off-street parking spaces may be allowed in any yards except
required front yards. Driveways into and/or thru front yards may be used as

elsewhere than on the same lot occupied by the use served shall be open to the
sky except when otherwise allowed.
   (B)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas, except a single parking
space accessory to a one-family dwelling, shall be improved with some
comparable all-weather dustless material.
   (C)   Screening and landscaping. In a business or M-1 or M-2 Manufacturing
District, all open automobile parking areas containing more than four parking
spaces shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on any
property in a residential district or any institutional premises, by a wall,
fence or densely planted compact hedge not less than five feet nor more than
seven feet in height. Such required screening shall conform with the front and
side yard setback requirements of the district in which the parking is located.
   (D)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas
shall be directed away from the residential properties in such a way as not to
create a nuisance.

conjunction with accessory off-street parking facilities provided in a
residential district.
      (2)   The sale of gasoline and motor oil in conjunction with accessory
off-street parking facilities is not permitted in any residential district.
   (F)   Maximum number of spaces. The total number of accessory parking spaces
provided for one-, two-, or multiple-family dwellings or hotels shall not
exceed that required herein for such use or for any equivalent new use by more
than 50%, or four spaces, whichever number is greater.
   (G)   Floor area exemptions. When two or more uses are located on the same
zoning lot, only one exception in terms of floor area - as set forth in
§ 151.110, shall be taken.

distances between such parking spaces and a main entrance to the use served.
   (A)   For uses in a residential district. Parking spaces accessory to

accessory to uses other than dwellings may be located on a lot adjacent to, or
directly across a street or alley from, the lot occupied by the use served, but
in no case at a distance in excess of 300 feet from such use.
   (B)   For uses in business and manufacturing districts. All required parking
spaces shall be within 1,000 feet of the use served, except for spaces

by action of the City Council. This approval must be in writing and placed on
the original tracing of the final plans.
   (B)   No lot, tract or parcel of land within any such subdivision shall be
offered for sale nor shall any sale, contract for sale, or option be made or
given until such subdivision plans have been properly reviewed by the Plan
Commission and officially approved by the City Council.
   (C)   No improvements, such as sidewalks, water supply, storm water
drainage, sewerage facilities, gas service, electric service or lighting,
grading, paving or surfacing of streets shall hereafter be made within any such
subdivision by any owner or owners, or his or her or their agent, or by any

§ 151.133 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The subdivision of land, including the arrangement, character, extent,
width, grade and location of all streets, alleys or other land to be dedicated
for public use, shall conform to the General Development Plan and to the
Official Map of the city as approved and adopted by the City Council and other
responsible governmental bodies; and shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public
convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets.
   (A)   Streets.
      (1)   All streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety,
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served
by such streets.
      (2)   Where such is not shown in the General Development Plan or on the
Official Map, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
         (a)   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of
existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or
         (b)   Conform to a plan for the area of neighborhood approved or
adopted by the Plan Commission to meet a particular situation where
topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing
streets impracticable.
      (3)   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by thru traffic
will be discouraged.
      (4)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
expressway or primary street, as shown on the General Development Plan or on
the Official Map, the Plan Commission may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting along the rear property line, deep lots
with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of thru
and local traffic.
      (5)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad or
expressway, the Plan Commission may require a street approximately parallel to
and on each side of such railroad or expressway, at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential
districts or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts.
Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separations.
      (6)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets or alleys shall be
prohibited.
      (7)   All street intersections and confluences should encourage safe
traffic flow.
      (8)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
      (9)   Tangents shall be introduced between reverse curves on all streets
(see Table of Minimum Standards).
      (10)   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one
point by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a
radius adequate to insure clear sight distances (see Table of Minimum
Standards).
      (11)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than 60
degrees.
      (12)   No fence, wall, hedge or shrub planting which obstructs sight
lines at elevations between two and six feet above the roadways shall be placed
or permitted to remain on any corner lot within the triangular area formed by
the street property lines and a line connecting them at points 25 feet from the
intersection of the street lines, or in the case of a rounded property corner
from the intersection of the street property lines extended. The same sight
line limitations shall apply on any lot within ten feet from the intersection
of a street property line with the edge of a driveway or alley pavement. No
tree shall be permitted to remain within such distances of such intersections
unless the foliage line, is maintained at a sufficient height to prevent
obstruction of such sight lines.
      (13)   Street right-of-way widths shall be shown in the General
Development Plan and on the Official Map, and where not shown therein shall be
as specified in the Table of Minimum Standards.
      (14)   Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations, and where the Plan Commission finds it will
be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within
such tract.
      (15)   Dead-end streets (cul-de-sac) designed to be so permanently, shall
not be longer than 500 feet from the intersection of the origin through the
center of the circle to the end of the right-of-way, and shall be provided at
the closed end with a turnaround having an outside pavement diameter of at
least 80 feet, and a street property line diameter of at least 20 feet greater
than the outside pavement diameter.
      (16)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets. Existing street names shall be projected
wherever possible. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Plan
Commission.
      (17)   Street gradients and vertical curves shall be as specified in the
Table of Minimum Standards.
      (18)   There shall be sufficient difference in elevation between street
grades and adjoining building sites so that streets can serve as open run-off
channels auxiliary to the storm sewers or as detention ponds without flooding
adjoining building sites.

   (B)   Alleys.
      (1)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial, business and industrial
districts, except that the Plan Commission may waive this requirement where
other definite and assured provisions are made for service access, such as off-
street loading, unloading and parking, consistent with and adequate for the
uses proposed.
      (2)    Alleys will be required in all new subdivisions, except as deemed
necessary and on the recommendation of the Plan Commission.
      (3)   The right-of-way width of an alley shall be 30 feet in residential
areas and 40 feet in commercial, business and industrial districts.
      (4)   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be
avoided, but where necessary corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit

subdivision plat and preserved for drainage.
   (D)   Block standards.
      (1)   The maximum lengths of blocks shall be 1,600 feet. Blocks over 600
feet may require cross-walkways. Cross-walk easements not less than ten feet in
width shall be provided where deemed necessary by the Plan Commission at the
approximate centers of the blocks. The use of additional cross-walkways in any
instance to provide safe and convenient access to schools, parks or other
similar destinations will be specified by the Plan Commission or the City
Council.
      (2)   No specific rule concerning the shape of blocks is made, but blocks
must fit easily into the overall plan of the subdivision and their design must
evidence consideration of lot planning, traffic flow and public areas.
      (3)   Blocks intended for commercial and industrial use must be
designated as such, and the plan must show adequate off-street areas to provide
for parking, loading docks and such other facilities that may be required to
accommodate motor vehicles.
   (E)   Lot standards. All residential lots shall conform to the minimum
requirements of this zoning code.
   (F)   Parks, schools and public areas.
      (1)   Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use area
shown on the General Development Plan or on the Official Map for the city and
adjacent unincorporated areas, is located in whole or in part in a subdivision,
the Plan Commission or the City Council shall require the reservation of such
area for acquisition in whole or in part within the subdivision in those cases
where the Plan Commission and the City Council deem such requirements to be
reasonable. However, in no case shall the total amount of required public areas
which are to be dedicated or reserved for acquisition by the proper governing
authorities exceed 7% of the total gross acreage controlled by one developer.
Such dedication or reservation shall be in addition to any public street
dedications. The acquisition of the additional area needed for parks,
playgrounds, schools or other public use other than streets and alleys, shall
be secured by the proper governing body or arrangements made for securing the
area from the owner within a period not to exceed one year.
      (2)   In subdividing any land within the city due regard shall be shown
for all natural features such as tree growth, water courses, historic spots or
similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to
the proposed development.

§ 151.159 SPECIAL USE VARIATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based upon
the division of the city into districts within which districts the use of land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation
to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there
are uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use at the particular location. Such uses fall into two
categories;
         (a)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest;
         (b)   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
      (2)   The special use variations may be recommended by the Zoning Board
of Appeals to the City Council following a public hearing and based upon the
evidence presented at such hearings as prescribed herein for the special use
variation.
   (B)   Initiation of special use variation. Any person owning or having an
interest in the subject property may file an application to use such land for
one or more of the uses provided for herein in the zoning district in which the
land is situated.
   (C)   Application for special use variation. 
      (1)   Any application for a use variation shall be filed with the City
Clerk’s office on a form prescribed by the Building Administrator. A filing fee
of $50 will accompany the filing of the application. The City Clerk’s office
shall provide the Building Administrator with a copy of such application.
      (2)   The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data
prescribed by the Building Administrator and shall include a statement in
writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed use
variation will conform to the standards set forth herein.
   (D)   Hearing on application. Upon receipt in proper form, of the
application and statement referred to above, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
hold at least one public hearing. At least 15 days in advance of each hearing,
notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper
of general circulation in the city. In addition, notice of all hearings shall
be sent to each civic or property owners' organization requesting notices of
hearings on use variations or amendments.
   (E)   Authorization. For each application of special use variation, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall report to the City Council it's findings and
recommendations, including the stipulations of additional conditions and
guarantees that such conditions will be complied with when they are deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest. The City Council may grant
or deny any application for a use variation provided, however, that in the
event of written protest against any proposed special use variation, signed and
acknowledged by the owners of 20% of the frontage immediately adjoining the
property proposed for a special use variation, or by the owners of 20% of the
frontage across an alley or directly opposite therefrom, such use variation
shall not be granted except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all the
members of the City Council.
   (F)   Standards. No special use variation shall be recommended by the Zoning
Board of Appeals unless said Board of Appeals shall find that:
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the use will not be
detrimental or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general
welfare.
      (2)   The use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor
substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (3)   The establishment of the use will not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the
district.
      (4)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      (5)   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
      (6)   The use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations
may in each instance be modified by the City Council pursuant to the
recommendations of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 88-30, passed 8-8-88; Am. Ord. 11-07, passed 4-11-11)
§ 151.160 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Planned developments are of such substantially different character
from other special use variations that specific and additional standards and
exceptions are hereby established to govern the recommendations of the Zoning
Board of Appeals and the action of the City Council.
   (B)   In the case of residential, business or manufacturing planned
developments, the Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend, and the City Council
may authorize, that there be in part of the area of such development and for
the duration of such development, specified uses not permitted by the use
regulations for the district in which said development is located, provided the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that:
      (1)   The uses permitted by such variation are necessary or desirable and
are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development;
      (2)   The uses permitted by such special use variation are not of such a
nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding
neighborhood;
      (3)   Not more than 20% of the ground area or of the gross floor area of
such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by said special use
variations;
      (4)   In a manufacturing planned development such additional uses allowed
by use variation shall conform with the performance standards of the district
in which the development is located, as set forth herein;
      (5)   The special use variation so allowed is reflected by the
appropriate zoning district symbols and so recorded on the zoning map.
   (C)   Bulk regulations. In the case of any planned developments, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may recommend and the City Council may authorize, variations
to the applicable bulk regulations of the zoning code within the boundaries of
such development, provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals shall find that:
      (1)   Such variation shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such
development, as well as of neighboring properties, than would be obtained under
the bulk regulations of the zoning code for buildings developed on separate
zoning lots.
      (2)   The over-all minimum lot area of maximum lot coverage of a
residential planned development would not exceed by more than 15% the
requirements for individual uses in the district in which such planned
development is located.
      (3)   The minimum lot area per dwelling unit requirements herein shall
not be decreased by more than 15% in any such development containing
residential uses, and that there shall be available to each residential
building and immediately adjacent thereto (including the land area upon which
it is erected) the minimum amount of land area required for such building under
the lot area per dwelling unit provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Spacing between principal buildings shall be at least equivalent to
such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly developed under
terms of this chapter on separate zoning lots, due consideration being given to
the openness normally afforded by intervening streets and alleys.
      (5)   Along the periphery of such planned developments, yards shall be
provided as required by the regulations of the district in which said
development is located.
   (D)   Conditions and guarantees. Prior to the granting of any use variation,
the Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the City Council shall stipulate,
such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance and operation of the special use variation as deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance
with the standards and requirements specified herein. In all cases in which
special use variations are granted, the City Council shall require such
evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be, complied with.
   (E)   Effect of denial of a use variation. No application of a special use
variation which has been denied wholly or in part by the City Council shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of said order of denial,
except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions found to
be valid by the Zoning Board of Appeals and the City Council.
   (F)   Revocation. In any case where a special use variation has not been
established within one year after the date of granting thereof, then without
further action by the Zoning Board of Appeals or the City Council, the special
use variation authorization shall be null and void.
(Ord. 88-30, passed 8-8-88)
§ 151.161 CHANGE OF ZONING.
   Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the Zoning
Board of Appeals the power or authority to alter or change the zoning code or
any use district made a part of the zoning map; such power and authority being
reserved to the City Council, and the Board of Appeals shall not have any power
or authority with respect to any alterations or change of the zoning code
except to make recommendations to the City Council in such specific cases as
may properly come before the Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 88-30, passed 8-8-88)
§ 151.162 MISCELLANEOUS.
   (A)   No order for a use variation permitting the erection or alteration of
a building shall be valid for a period longer than six months unless such use
is established within such period; provided, however, that where such use
permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such
order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit for said erection
or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection or alteration is
started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
   (B)   No order for a use variation permitting a use of a building or
premises shall be valid for a period longer than six months unless such use is
established within such period; provided, however, that where such use
permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such
order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit for said erection
or alteration is obtained within such period and such erection or alteration is
started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
(Ord. 88-30, passed 8-8-88)
§ 151.163 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   The appeal shall stay all proceedings and furtherance of the action appealed
from unless the Building Administrator certifies to the Zoning Board of
Appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property; in which case the proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning
Board of Appeals or by Court of Record on application, with notice to the
officer from whom the appeal is taken, and all due causes shown.
(Ord. 88-30, passed 8-8-88)
