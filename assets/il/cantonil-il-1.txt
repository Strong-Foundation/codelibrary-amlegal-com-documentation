of holding the same. No business other than that mentioned in the call shall be

1-6-6: PUBLIC NOTICE OF MEETINGS; AGENDA:  
The city shall give public notice of the schedule of regular meetings at the
beginning of each calendar or fiscal year and shall state the regular dates,
times, and places of such meetings.
An agenda for each regular meeting shall be posted at city hall and at the
Historic Depot - Donald E. Edwards Way, 50 North 4th Avenue, Canton, Illinois
61520, which is where the city's meetings are held, at least forty-eighty (48)
hours in advance of the holding of the meeting. The city shall also post on its
website the agenda of any regular meetings. Any agenda of a regular meeting
that is posted on the city 's website shall remain posted on the website until
the regular meeting is concluded. The requirement of a regular meeting agenda
shall not preclude the consideration of items not specifically set forth in the
agenda.
Public notice of any special meeting except a meeting held in the event of a
bona fide emergency, or of any rescheduled regular meeting, or of any
reconvened meeting, shall be given at least forty-eighty (48) hours before such
meeting, which notice shall also include the agenda for the special,
rescheduled, or reconvened meeting, but the validity of any action taken by the
city which is germane to a subject on the agenda shall not be affected by other
errors or omissions in the agenda. The requirement of public notice of
reconvened meetings does not apply to any case where the meeting was open to
the public and (1) it is to be reconvened within twenty-four (24) hours, or (2)
an announcement of the time and place of the reconvened meeting was made at the
original meeting and there is no change in the agenda. Notice of an emergency
meeting shall be given as soon as practicable, but in any event prior to the
holding of such meeting, to any news medium which has filed an annual request
for notice with the city clerk in accordance with the Illinois Open Meetings
Act.Public notice shall be given by posting a copy of the notice at city hall
and at the Historic Depot - Donald E. Edwards Way, 50 North 4th Avenue, Canton,
Illinois 61520, which is where the city 's meetings are held. In addition, the
city shall post notice on its website of all meetings of the council and the
standing committees. Any notice of an annual schedule of meetings shall remain
on the website until a new public notice of the schedule of regular meetings is
approved. Any notice of a regular meeting that is posted on the city's website
shall remain posted on the website until the regular meeting is concluded. The
city shall supply copies of the notice of its regular meetings, and of the
notice of any special, emergency, rescheduled or reconvened meeting, to any
news medium that has filed an annual request for such notice. Any such news
medium shall also be given the same notice of all special, emergency,
rescheduled or reconvened meetings in the same manner as is given to members of
the body provided such news medium has given the city clerk an address or
telephone number within the territorial jurisdiction of the city at which such
notice may be given. The failure of the city to post on its website notice of
any meeting or the agenda of any meeting shall not invalidate any meeting or
any actions taken at a meeting. Any agenda shall set forth the general subject
matter of any resolution or ordinance that will be the subject of final action
at the meeting. The city, in conducting a public meeting, shall ensure that at
least one copy of any requested notice and agenda for the meeting is
continuously available for public review during the entire forty-eighty (48)-
hour period preceding the meeting. Posting of the notice and agenda on the
city's website satisfies this requirement. If a notice or agenda is not
continuously available for the full forty-eighty (48)-hour period due to
actions outside of the control of the public body, then that lack of
availability does not invalidate any meeting or action taken at a meeting.
The council and the committees, as applicable, must, at the beginning of each
calendar or fiscal year, prepare and make available a schedule of all regular
meetings for such calendar or fiscal year, listing the times and places of such
meetings.
If a change is made in regular meeting dates, at least ten (10) days' notice of
such change shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation
in the city in which such body functions. Notice of such change shall also be
posted at city hall and at the Historic Depot - Donald E. Edwards Way, 50 North
4th Avenue, Canton, Illinois 61520, which is where the city's meetings are
held. Notice of such change shall also be supplied to those news media which
have filed an annual request for notice. (Ord. 232, 11-21-1967; amd. Ord. 4339,
5-2-2023)
1-6-7: MAYOR PRO TEM; TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  
If the mayor is temporarily absent because of an incapacity to perform official
duties, but the incapacity does not create a vacancy in the office, the
corporate authorities shall elect one of their members to act as mayor pro
tern. The mayor pro tern, during this absence or disability, shall perform the
duties and possess all the rights and powers of the mayor but shall not be
entitled to vote both as mayor pro tern and as alderman.
In the absence of the mayor, acting mayor, or mayor pro tern, the corporate
authorities may elect one of their members to act as a temporary chairman. The

the city, and are not unable through sickness to attend; and any member who
purposely absents himself from the city in order to avoid attending any meeting

all members then holding office on the city council, including the mayor,
unless otherwise expressly provided by other applicable law governing the
passage of any ordinance, resolution, or motion. Where the council consists of
an odd number of aldermen, however, the vote of the majority of the aldermen
shall be sufficient to pass an ordinance. The passage of an ordinance,
resolution, or motion to sell any school property shall require the concurrence
of three-fourths (3/4) of all aldermen then holding office. The yeas and nays
shall be taken upon the question of the passage of the designated ordinances,
resolutions, or motions and recorded in the journal of the city council. In

meeting may by unanimous consent take a single vote by yeas and nays on the
several questions of the passage of any two (2) or more of the designated
ordinances, orders, resolutions, or motions placed together for voting purposes
in a single group. The single vote shall be entered separately in the journal
under the designation "omnibus vote," and in that event the clerk may enter the
words "omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal in each case instead of
entering the names of the members of city council voting "yea" and those voting
"nay" on the passage of each of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions,
and motions included in the omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of a
single or omnibus vote and the entries of the words "omnibus vote" or "consent
agenda" in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance with the requirements
of this section to all intents and purposes and with like effect as if the vote
in each case had been taken separately by yeas and nays on the question of the
passage of each ordinance, order, resolution, and motion included in the
omnibus group and separately recorded in the journal. Likewise, the yeas and
nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of any other resolution or
motion at the request of any aldermen and shall be recorded in the journal.
The mayor shall preside at all meetings of the city council. The mayor shall
not vote on any ordinance, resolution, or motion except the following: (i)

motion even though there is no tie vote; or (iii) where a vote greater than a
majority of the corporate authorities is required by this Code or an ordinance
to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or motion. Nothing in this Section shall
deprive an acting mayor or mayor pro tern from voting in the capacity as
alderperson, but he or she shall not be entitled to another vote in the
capacity as acting mayor or mayor pro tem. (R.O. 1959, Ch. 2, Sec. 24; amd.

days after their passage. The mayor may disapprove of any one or more sums
appropriated in any ordinance, resolution, or motion making an appropriation,
and, if so, the remainder shall be effective. However, the mayor may disapprove
entirely of an ordinance, resolution, or motion making an appropriation. If the
mayor fails to return any ordinance or any specified resolution or motion with
his written objections within the designated time, it shall become effective
despite the absence of the mayor's signature.
Every resolution and motion (i) that create any liability against a city, (ii)
that provide for the expenditure or appropriation of its money, or (iii) to
sell any city or school property, and every ordinance, that is returned to the
city council by the mayor shall be reconsidered by the city council at the next
regular meeting following the regular meeting at which the city council
receives the mayor's written objection. If, after reconsideration, two-thirds
of all the aldermen then holding office on the city council agree at that
regular meeting to pass an ordinance, resolution, or motion, notwithstanding
the mayor's refusal to approve it, then it shall be effective. The vote on the
question of passage over the mayor's veto shall be by yeas and nays and shall
be recorded in the journal. (R.O. 1959, Ch. 2, Sec. 25; amd. Ord. 4339, 5-2-

otherwise may be fair and suitable in particularized instances, shall from time
to time be considered and made, provided, however, that any such adjustments
shall be in the sole discretion of the corporate authorities of this city and,
further, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as an inducement,
promise or obligation running from the employer to any department head.
In the interpretation of the paragraph immediately preceding, it is hereby
declared that the spirit and principles of all provisions of this city having
to do with vacation pay, holiday pay, nighttime bonus and sick pay, together
with the concept of reasonable and periodic time off from the demands of duty
and employment, applies to department heads.
Accordingly, in the implementation and application of the provisions of the two
(2) paragraphs hereto preceding, it shall be the duty of each department head
to make weekly reports of the circumstances of his employment (whether by him
deemed unusual or not) to the chairman of the appropriate committee of this
city, charged with immediate concern for and over the department of his
employment, who is hereby authorized and directed to make such immediate
adjustments of salary and conditions of employment as may be consonant with the

of eight (8) hours' regular pay applicable to each such person.
The calendar day on which each such holiday falls and for which payment is to
be made, as herein provided, shall be as provided by law, or in the absence
thereof, by custom.
For the purpose of clarification, the intent of the foregoing is that each such
employee shall receive his regular pay for each named holiday if not worked;
triple if worked.
Department heads shall not work on any of the holidays named except in
emergency or necessitous circumstances which cannot be circumvented. (Ord. 584,
4-26-1977)
1-8-10: NIGHTTIME BONUS:
Each full time employee, official, officer, or department head of this city,
excepting of members of the fire department, who works a regular eight (8) hour
night shift as a part of his regular workweek, shall receive and be paid an
additional increase in his basic weekly salary in the amount of one-fifth (1/5)
of three percent (3%) thereof for such eight (8) hour night shift actually
worked. For the purpose of this section, the term "night shift" shall mean any
regular eight (8) hour period actually worked between the hours of three
o'clock (3:00) P.M. of any day and seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. of the day
thereafter immediately succeeding. (Ord. 584, 4-26-1977)
1-8-11: SICK PAY:
Each full time employee, official, officer, department head (including persons
who work in full time appointive positions), shall be entitled to and shall be
paid, during the fiscal year of the employer, as sick pay. Time taken off for
personal reasons shall be construed to be within the meaning of and encompassed
by the term "sick pay". The maximum sick pay to be paid by the employer to any
employee on account of any fiscal year of the employer shall be: six (6) 8-hour
days of regular pay (i.e., 6/5 of the basic weekly salary, based on 40 hours
actually worked, plus additives in the case of full time employees; 6/5 of the
basic weekly salary of department heads; or 6/5 the weekly salary of full time
appointive persons [together with applicable additives]).
In the event this sick pay is not paid to the individual entitled during the
current fiscal year on account of actual illness or actual personal time off
for personal reasons, the same shall be paid at the commencement of the ensuing
fiscal year of the employer, or as near thereto as practicable.
An employee entitled to sick pay, as hereinabove provided, shall also be
entitled to two (2) additional sick days off with eight (8) hours of regular
pay therefor during the fiscal year of the city under the following conditions:
Subject to a right of election, as hereinafter set forth, these additional days
may be utilized only after the sick days to which such employee is entitled as
hereinabove set forth, have actually been used as time off during the fiscal
year; and, in the event the employee is called for emergency duty with the city
on any such day, he shall be paid for such emergency duty at his straight time
rate, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary any place set forth.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, any employee, who is
a member of the fire or police department and also subject to the jurisdiction
of the fire and police commission of this city, may, at his election, timely
made known in writing prior to the end of any fiscal year, accumulate one or
both such days to which he may have become entitled to during such fiscal year
and for each succeeding fiscal year thereafter ensuing until a maximum of
fifteen (15) of such days have been accumulated. These days, so accumulated,
may be used by such employee as time off days without pay therefor above or in
addition to his regular salary.
Computation of sick pay for any employee newly hired as a full time employee,
whether for the first time or after a break in service with the city, shall be
computed with reference to the fiscal year of the city. Thus, the sick pay
entitlement of such an employee shall consist of that percent of the maximum
sick pay (hereinabove provided) which his length of service in the fiscal year
of his hiring bears to the entire length of such fiscal year. Such a newly
hired employee shall not be entitled as a matter of right to extra time off as
a sick day.
The sick pay hereinabove provided shall be paid only after presentment to the
clerk and treasurer of this city of a voucher or certificate of verification
signed by the applicable department head and countersigned by the applicable
committee chairman manifesting the entitlement of the particular employee to
the sick pay claimed. A department head shall sign his own voucher and on his
own behalf and this, as to him, shall be sufficient when countersigned by the
applicable committee chairman. (Ord. 584, 4-26-1977)

1-21-6-4: Service Provider Arrangements
1-21-7: Procedure For Opening New Utility Accounts
1-21-1: BACKGROUND:
New federal regulations under the fair and accurate credit transactions act of
2003 (commonly referred to as the "red flag rules") require financial
institutions and creditors to develop and implement written identity theft
prevention programs. The term "creditor" includes municipalities that provide
services, such as utilities, to customers and subsequently bill for those
services. Initially, the due date for implementation of "red flag rules" was
November 1, 2008. In October of 2008, the federal trade commission suspended
enforcement of the new rules until May 1, 2009, to give financial institutions
and creditors additional time in which to develop written identity theft
prevention programs.
The city of Canton has developed this identity theft prevention program
("program") pursuant to the federal trade commission's red flag rules ("rules")
which implements section 114 of the fair and accurate credit transactions act
of 2003 (16 CFR section 6812).
This program was developed with oversight and approval of the city council.
After considering the size and complexity of the city's operations and
accounting systems and of the nature and scope of the city's activities, the
city council determined that this program was appropriate for the city of
Canton, and therefore approved this program on April 8, 2009, as ordinance
1968. (Ord. 1968, 4-7-2009)
1-21-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this program is to protect customers of the city of Canton's
utility services from identity theft. The program is intended to help the city
establish reasonable policies and procedures to:
   (A)   Implement data security; and
   (B)   Identify risks that signify potentially fraudulent activity within new
or existing covered accounts; and
   (C)   Detect risks when they occur in covered accounts; and
   (D)   Respond to risks to determine if fraudulent activity has occurred and
mitigate the risk if fraud has been attempted or committed; and
   (E)   Update the program periodically, including reviewing the accounts that
are covered and the identified risks that are part of the program. (Ord. 1968,
4-7-2009)
1-21-3: SCOPE:
This program applies to the creation of, modification of, and access to the
identifying information of a holder of one or more of the utilities operated by
the city and all employees of the city. This program does not replace or repeal
any previously existing policies or programs addressing some or all of the
activities that are the subject of this program, but rather it is intended to
supplement any such existing policies and programs. (Ord. 1968, 4-7-2009)
1-21-4: DEFINITIONS:
When used in this program, the following terms have the meanings set forth
opposite their name, unless the context clearly requires that the term be given
a different meaning:
COVERED ACCOUNT: An account that the city offers or maintains, primarily for
personal, family or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit
multiple payments of transactions (16 CFR section 681.2(b)(3)(i)).
Specifically, a utility account for garbage, water or sewer is a "covered
account".
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: Any name or number that may be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,
including any name, social security number, date of birth, official state or
government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration
number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number.
   (A)   Additional examples of "identifying information" are set forth in 16
CFR section 603.2(a).
IDENTITY THEFT: A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority (16 CFR sections 681.2(b)(8)
and 603.2(a)).
RED FLAG: A pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates the possible
existence of identity theft or fraud.
RED FLAG RULE OR RULE: The federal administrative regulations that implement
section 114 of the fair and accurate transactions act of 2003 (12 CFR sections
41.90 and 41.91).
Certain terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the FTC's identity theft rules (16 CFR section 681) or the
fair credit reporting act of 1970 (15 USC section 1681 et seq.), as amended by
the fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 (public law 108-159).
(Ord. 1968, 4-7-2009)
1-21-5: IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION ELEMENTS:
1-21-5-1: IDENTIFICATION OF RELEVANT RED FLAGS:
The city has considered the guidelines and the illustrative examples of
possible red flags from the FTC's identity theft rules and has reviewed the
city's past history with instances of identity theft. The city hereby
determines that the following are relevant red flags for purposes of this
program given the size of the city and the limited nature and scope of utility
services that the city provides to its citizens:
   (A)   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers.
      1.   A fraud or active duty alert included with a consumer report.
      2.   A notice of credit freeze from a consumer reporting agency in
response to a request for a consumer report.

of 2003.
   (B)   The presentation of suspicious documents.
      1.   Documents provided for ID appear to have been altered, forged or
inauthentic.
      2.   The photograph or physical description is not consistent with the

existing customer information (such as a person's signature on a check appears
forged).
      4.   Any application for service that appears to have been altered,
forged or inauthentic.
   (C)   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information.
      1.   Any identifying information that is presented that is inconsistent
with other information that the customer provides (such as inconsistent birth
dates).
      2.   Any identifying information that is presented that is inconsistent
with other sources of information (such as an address that does not match the
address on a credit report).
      3.   Any identifying information that is presented that is the same as
information shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent.
      4.   Any identifying information that is presented that is consistent
with fraudulent activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing
address).
      5.   A social security number that is presented that is the same as one
given by another customer.
      6.   An address or phone number that is presented that is the same as
that of another person.
      7.   Any instance where a person fails to provide complete personal
identifying information on an application after being reminded to do so.
      8.   Any instance where a person's identifying information is not
consistent with the information that is on file for that customer.

change the account holder's name.
      2.   Any instance where payments stop on an otherwise consistently up to
date account.
      3.   Any instance where an account is used in a way that is inconsistent
with its prior use (such as very high activity).
      4.   Any instance where mail that was sent to the account holder is
repeatedly returned as undeliverable.
      5.   Any instance where the city is notified that a customer is not
receiving mail.
      6.   Any notice to the city that an account has unauthorized activity.
      7.   A breach of the city's computer system security.
      8.   Any unauthorized access to or use of customer account information.
   (E)   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from customers,
victims, law enforcement authorities or other persons.
      1.   The city identifies it as a red flag if the city receives notice
from a customer, an identity theft victim, law enforcement or other persons
that the city has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent account for a person
engaged in identity theft. (Ord. 1968, 4-7-2009)
1-21-5-2: DETECTION OF RED FLAGS:
   (A)   New Accounts: As part of this program, a procedure for opening new
utility accounts has been incorporated that will provide consistency in
detecting red flags (see section
1-21-7 of this chapter). In order to detect any of the red flags that are
associated with opening of a new account, city personnel must take the
following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the
account:
      1.   Require certain identifying information such as name, date of birth,

SECTION:
1-23-1: Purpose
1-23-2: Red Flag Rules
1-23-3: Policy Statement
1-23-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this policy is to establish steps that ensure the collection,
use, disclosure and protection of individuals' social security numbers in
compliance with the identity protection act, 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 179/
1 et seq. To protect against identity theft, this policy will define the ways
social security numbers can and cannot be used and will limit access to social
security numbers. (Ord. 3002, 11-6-2012)
1-23-2: RED FLAG RULES:
The fair and accurate credit transactions act of 2003 (FACT act) required
certain financial institutions and creditors with "covered accounts" to
prepare, adopt, and implement an identity theft prevention program to identify,
detect, respond to and mitigate patterns, practices or specific activities
which could indicate identity theft. The city of Canton ("city") maintains
utility accounts (water, sewer, garbage) that involve multiple payments or
transactions and these accounts are "covered accounts" within the meaning of
the FACT act. In order to comply with the obligations of the FACT act, the city
of Canton approved an identity theft prevention program via ordinance 1968 on
April 7, 2009. As adopted, the program only applied to utility accounts. This
identity protection policy is not intended to replace, but may supplement the
identity theft prevention program. (Ord. 3002, 11-6-2012)
1-23-3: POLICY STATEMENT:
This policy with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of
individuals' social security numbers is intended to comply with the identity

         (c)   Require an individual to transmit his or her social security
number over the internet, unless the connection is secure or the social
security number is encrypted;
         (d)   Print an individual's social security number on any materials
that are mailed to the individual, through the U.S. postal service, any private
mail service, and electronic mail or any similar method of delivery, unless
state or federal law requires the social security number to be on the document
to be mailed. Notwithstanding any provision in this subsection to the contrary,
social security numbers may be included in applications and forms sent by mail,
including, but not limited to, any material mailed in connection with
administration of the unemployment insurance act, any material mailed in
connection with any tax administered by the Illinois department of revenue, and
documents sent as part of an application or enrollment process or to establish,
amend or terminate an account, contract, or policy, or to confirm the accuracy
of the social security number. A social security number that may permissibly be
mailed under this subsection may not be printed, in whole or in part, on a
postcard or other mailer that does not require an envelope, or be visible on an
envelope without the envelope having been opened.
      2.   Except as otherwise provided in this policy, no officer or employee
of the city shall do any of the following:
         (a)   Collect, use, or disclose a social security number from an
individual unless:

regulations, or the collection, use or disclosure of the social security number
is otherwise necessary for the performance of that officer's or employee's
duties and responsibilities;

documented before collection of the social security number; and

documented need and purpose.

to access an internet website.

other than the purpose for which it was collected.
      3.   The prohibitions in subsection (A)2 of this section, do not apply in
the following circumstances:
         (a)   The disclosure of social security numbers to agents, employees,
contractors, or subcontractors of the city, or disclosure to another
governmental entity or its agents, employees, contractors, or subcontractors,
if disclosure is necessary in order for the city to perform its duties and
responsibilities; and, if disclosing to a contractor or subcontractor, prior to
such disclosure, the officer or employee of the city must first receive from
the contractor or subcontractor a copy of the contractor's or subcontractor's
policy that sets forth how the requirements imposed under this policy of the
city, to protect an individual's social security number, will be achieved.

1999), or to locate a missing person, a lost relative, or a person who is due a
benefit, such as a pension benefit or an unclaimed property benefit.
      4.   Any previously adopted standards of the city, for the collection,
use, or disclosure of social security numbers, that are stricter than the
standards under this policy with respect to the protection of those social
security numbers, shall, in the event of any conflict with the provisions of
this policy, control.
   (B)   Public Inspection And Copying Of Documents: Notwithstanding any other
provision of this policy to the contrary, all officers and employees of the
city must comply with the provisions of any other state law with respect to
allowing the public inspection and copying of information or documents
containing all or any portion of any individual's social security number. All
officers and employees of the city must redact social security numbers from the
information or documents before allowing the public inspection or copying of
the information or documents, as such information is exempt from disclosure
under the freedom of information act, pursuant to 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes
140/7(1)(b) as "private information", as defined by 5 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 140/2(c-5).
   (C)   Applicability:

may encode or embed a social security number in or on a card or document,
including, but not limited to, using a bar code, chip, magnetic strip, RFID
technology or other technology, in place of removing the social security number
as required by this policy.
   (F)   Identity Protection Requirements:

to social security numbers in the course of performing their duties, shall
receive training in regard to protecting the confidentiality of social security
numbers. Said training shall include instructions on the proper handling of
information that contains social security numbers from the time of collection
through the destruction of the information.
      2.   Only officers and employees of the city who are required to use or
handle information or documents that contain social security numbers shall have
access to such information or documents.
      3.   Social security numbers requested from an individual shall be
provided in a manner that makes the social security number easily redacted if
required to be released as part of a public records request.
      4.   When collecting a social security number, or upon request by the
individual providing the social security number, a statement of the purpose or
purposes for which the city is collecting and using the social security number
shall be provided.

filed with the city clerk immediately upon approval of this policy or any
amendments thereto.

CHAPTER 27
GENERAL PENALTY
SECTION:
1-27-1: Purpose
1-27-2: General Penalties
1-27-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for penalties of
violations of this code when there are no penalties specified and to establish
a fine amount and settlement opportunity for certain violations of this code.
(Ord. 4033, 7-20-2016)
1-27-2: GENERAL PENALTIES:
   (A)   Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the City any act is
prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or whenever in
such Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided
therefore, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any ordinance
shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and
not more than seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense. Each
day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance shall
continue shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   Settlement Procedures:
      1.   Fee Schedule: From time to time, the city council shall adopt a
violation fee schedule (or "Fee Schedule") that shall set forth pre-authorized
settlement amounts for certain violations of this code, as set forth therein,
that may be settled without the necessity of a court appearance. The pre-
authorized amounts may not be decreased by the Canton Police Department without
approval by the City Attorney. The Fee Schedule may also list certain
violations in which the Canton Police Department is not allowed to settle
without a court appearance. The Fee Schedule may also include additional fines
or fees for subsequent offenses.
      2.   Acceptance of Guilty Plea and Waiver of Trial with Full Payment of
Settlement Amount: If a pre-authorized fee is set forth for a particular
violation in the Fee Schedule, the Canton Police Department may accept an
executed Guilty Plea and Waiver of Trial (on a form provided prepared by the
City Attorney), along with payment of the settlement fee amount set forth in
the Fee Schedule. The alleged violator must execute a Guilty Plea and Waiver of
Trial and pay the full, allowed settlement fee amount listed in the Fee
Schedule within fourteen (14) days after the issuance of the citation. Payments
shall be made by cash, certified check, cashier's check or money order made
payable to the City of Canton. Payments for ordinance violations shall not be
made online without the expressed permission of the Canton Police Department.
No settlement may be accepted by the Canton Police Department without a fully
executed Guilty Plea and Waiver of Trial. If the Guilty Pleas and Waiver of
Trial, along with the full, allowed settlement fee is not paid within fourteen
(14) days after the issuance of the citation, the citation shall be filed with
the Circuit Court of Fulton County, Illinois for prosecution by the City
Attorney, except as otherwise permitted below. The Canton Police Department may
require the signature or acknowledgment of parent or legal guardian prior to
the execution of Guilty Plea and Waiver of Trial by a minor.
      3.   Denial of Settlement Amount, Guilty Plea, and Waiver of Trial: If
the Chief of Police determines that the violation(s) should be forwarded to the
City Attorney for prosecution rather than pre-court settlement, for whatever
purpose, he or she may refuse to accept the payment of the settlement amounts
set forth in the Fee Schedule, as well as the Guilty Plea and Waiver of Trial.
However, in the event the City Attorney authorizes any settlement by written
agreement or court order, the Canton Police Department shall accept the Guilty
Plea and Waiver of Trial, and the payment of any fines or fees, as approved by
the City Attorney.
      4.   City Attorney: The City Attorney shall have the authority to delay
filing with the court any citation charging a person with violation of this
code in order to allow that person an opportunity to settle the case prior to
his or her court appearance. The City Attorney, in his or her prosecutorial
discretion, is further authorized to dismiss any filed ordinance violation
case, vacate any judgment issued in an ordinance violation case, modify
ordinance violation charges brought against the violator, and/or settle any
ordinance violation case (before or after filing) for an amount or punishment
that varies from the amounts listed in the Fee Schedule, including but not
limited to, by requiring community service in addition to and/or in lieu of a
fee or fine.
   (C)   Minors: In addition to and/or in lieu of a monetary fine, any
violation of this code by a minor may be punished by performance of community
service as agreed upon by the City Attorney or otherwise ordered by a court of
law. In addition, for any violation involving a minor, the City Attorney may
offer to dismiss a matter upon successful completion of community service and/
or payment of a fine and court costs. Before, during or after a court
appearance, the City Attorney has the authority to settle any violation in an
amount or punishment that varies from the settlement amount in the Fee
Schedule, as determined appropriate in his or her discretion, including but not
limited to, by requiring community service in addition to and/or in lieu of a
fee or fine.
   (D)   City Attorney: The City Attorney is further authorized to file a
complaint, citation, ticket, or other charging document, as permitted by law,
with any appropriate court for any violation of this code. In such event, only
the City Attorney shall be authorized to approve any settlement related to the
case filed by the City Attorney. (Ord. 4033, 7-20-2016; amd. Ord. 4322, 2-7-

SEXUAL HARASSMENT
SECTION:
1-28-1: Prohibition On Sexual Harassment

1-28-3: Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment
1-28-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations

1-28-7: Education/Training
1-28-8: Legal Rights Under Law
1-28-9: City Disclosures
1-28-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
The City of Canton is committed to maintaining a work environment that
encourages and fosters appropriate conduct among colleagues and respect for
individual values and sensibilities. Accordingly, the City officers and
administration are committed to enforcing its Sexual Harassment Policy at all
levels within the work place and creating an environment free from
discrimination of any kind, including sexual harassment.
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the City of Canton to prohibit harassment of
any person by any Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or
Municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All Municipal
officials, Municipal agents, Municipal employees and Municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof. (Ord. 4092, 12-19-2017, eff. 12-19-
2017)
1-28-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   (A)   This chapter adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in
the Illinois Human Rights Act. At the time of this chapter, "sexual harassment"
means any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment;
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
      For purposes of this definition, the phrase "working environment" is not
limited to a physical location an employee is assigned to perform his or her
duties.
   (B)    Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      1.   Verbal: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
      2.   Non-verbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing
the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/electronic: "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
(Ord. 4092, 12-19-2017, eff. 12-19-2017; amd. Ord. 4179, 1-21-2020)
1-28-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate Supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (A)   Reporting: Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be
sexual harassment, including the following:
      1.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      2.   Contact With Supervisory Personnel: At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate Supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
Director of Human Resources, an Ethics Officer, the City Clerk, or the Mayor.
         (a)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a Supervisor or other
responsible officer, the Municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      3.   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this chapter is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
Municipality. However, all Municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint
with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days.
      4.   Allegations of Sexual Harassment made against an elected official of
the governmental unit by another elected official of the governmental unit: In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the Mayor or City Clerk. The
official receiving the request shall notify the City Attorney and shall take
immediate action in keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to
retain a qualified individual or entity for the independent review of the
allegations of sexual harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of
the independent review shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
   (B)   Documentation: Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any
report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including,
but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
   (C)   Allegations: All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be
accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention
of the Municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual
harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and
the questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
   (D)   Investigation Of Complaint: When a complaint has been reduced to
writing, the immediate Supervisor or the individual informed who works in a
Supervisor capacity, shall initiate an investigation of the suspected sexual
harassment within five (5) working days of notification. If necessary, the
immediate Supervisor shall designate another supervisory or management employee
of the opposite sex to assess him/her or the alternate individual in the
investigation. If the immediate Supervisor is subject of the investigation, the
investigation will include an interview with the employee who made the initial
report, the person(s) towards whom the suspected harassment was directed and
the individual(s) accused of the harassment.
   (E)   Report: The immediate Supervisor or designated person responsible for
investigating the complaint shall prepare a written report within ten (10)
working days from notification of the suspected harassment unless extenuating
circumstances prevent him/her from doing so. The report shall include a finding
that sexual harassment occurred. A copy of the report will be given to the
employee(s) to whom the suspected harassment was directed, and the employee(s)
suspected of the harassment.
   (F)   Records; Confidentiality: Employees who report incidents of sexual
harassment are encouraged to keep written notes in order to accurately record
the offensive conduct. Every effort shall be made to keep all matters related
to the investigation and various reports confidential, subject to the State of
Illinois Freedom of Information Act. In the event of a lawsuit, however, the
City advises that records it maintains and the complainant maintains may not be
considered privileged from disclosure. Written records will be maintained for
four (4) years from the date of resolution unless new circumstances dictate
that the file should be kept for a longer period of time.
   (G)   Appeals Process: If either party directly involved in a sexual
harassment investigation is dissatisfied with the outcome or resolution, that
individual has a right to appeal the decision. The dissatisfied party should
submit his/her written comments in a timely manner to the Mayor or Chairman of
the Negotiations, Grievance, and Personnel Committee. (Ord. 4092, 12-19-2017,
eff. 12-19-2017; amd. Ord. 4179, 1-21-2020; Ord. 4196, 6-16-2020)
1-28-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   (A)   No Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal employee or
Municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
Municipal employee due to a Municipal employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
chapter,
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this chapter, or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   For the purposes of this chapter, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any Municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a Municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act 1  provides whistleblower protection
from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a Supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee, or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act 2 , an employer may not retaliate
against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other
proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation 3 .
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act 4 , it is a civil rights
violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire, to retaliate
against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in
good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has
made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - due within one hundred eighty (180) days (IDHR) or
three hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. 4092, 12-19-
2017, eff. 12-19-2017)

1-28-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this chapter or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 430/
5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the Municipality and any
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State
law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the Municipality shall be separate and distinct from any
penalty imposed by an Ethics Commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a
court of law or a State or Federal agency.
Disciplinary action will be taken against any employee found to have engaged in
sexual harassment of any other employee. The extent of sanctions may depend in
part upon the length and conditions of employment of the particular employee
and the nature of the offense. The City has the right to apply any sanction or
combination of sanctions, up to and including discharge, to deal with
unreasonable conduct or discrimination.
Where a hostile work environment has been found to exist, the City will take
all reasonable steps to eliminate the conduct creating such an environment.
(Ord. 4092, 12-19-2017, eff. 12-19-2017)
1-28-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this chapter shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
Municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an Ethics Commission, an Inspector General, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 4092, 12-19-2017, eff.
12-19-2017)
1-28-7: EDUCATION/TRAINING:
   Education and training for employees at each level of the work force are

The local liquor control commissioner shall, within five (5) days after such
hearing, if he determines after such hearing that the license should be revoked
or suspended or that the licensee should be fined, state the reason or reasons
for such determination in a written order, and either the amount of the fine,
the period of suspension, or that the license has been revoked, and shall serve
a copy of such order within the five (5) days upon the licensee.
The licensee, after the receipt of such order of suspension or revocation,
shall have the privilege, within a period of twenty (20) days after the receipt
of such order of suspension or revocation, of appealing the order to the state
commission for a decision sustaining, reversing or modifying the order of the
local liquor control commissioner. If the state commission affirms the local
commissioner's order to suspend or revoke the license at the first hearing, the
appellant shall cease to engage in the business for which the license was
issued, until the local commissioner's order is terminated by its own
provisions or reversed upon rehearing or by the courts. (Ord. 1905, 4-18-2007)

   (A)   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights of way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights of way.
   (B)   Duration: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within

takes longer than six (6) months, a permit extension must be sought from the
public works director or city engineer.
   (C)   Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant
to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and
all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held
at a date, time and place designated by the city with such city representatives
in attendance as the city deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose
of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights of
way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.

submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within ninety (90) days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
4-5-21 of this chapter. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor. (Ord. 1936, 7-2-2008)

subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors
shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy

intent to cancel or not to renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event
later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.

appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the permittee or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the permittee's indemnity obligations hereunder shall
not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or
expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach
of this chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 1936, 7-2-2008)
4-5-10: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a certified check, a surety bond in
a form acceptable to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant
to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the city engineer or director of public works, and may
also include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. At a
minimum, the security fund shall be no less than twenty thousand dollars
($20,000.00). Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit
will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase
consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of
locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior
to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the
city engineer or director of public works may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall
be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (C) for
any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 1936, 7-2-2008)

to comply with the provisions of subsection (C) of this section, the city or
its designee may, at the option of the city: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2)
upon not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days'
notice to the permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them
abandoned and property of the city. The permittee shall be liable in all events
to the city for all costs of removal. (Ord. 1936, 7-2-2008)

right of way, the permittee shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does

adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the permittee shall, as soon as possible, notify
the city engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If

why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority To Grant Variances: The city engineer shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The city engineer may authorize a
variance only if the permittee requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the permittee (such
as terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the city engineer may require the permittee requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. 1936, 7-2-2008)
   (E)   Right To Appeal: Any permittee aggrieved by any order, requirement,

the joint planning and zoning commission. The application for appeal shall be
submitted in writing to the city clerk within thirty (30) days after the date
of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The joint planning and

any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the city will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the permittee
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the permittee shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the permittee shall bear the city's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a permittee that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 1936, 7-2-2008)

6-2-1: FUND CREATED:
The council shall annually, hereafter, levy a tax upon all the taxable property
in the city at the rate on the dollar of all such taxable property which will
produce an amount which, when added to the deductions from the salaries or
wages of policemen and receipts available from all other sources as hereinafter
referred to, will equal a sufficient sum to meet the annual requirements of the
pension fund under the provisions of this chapter. Such tax shall be levied and
collected in like manner with general taxes of the city, and shall be in
addition to all other taxes now or hereafter authorized to be levied upon all
property within the city, and shall be in addition to the amount authorized to
be levied for general purposes. In the event that the pension fund in any year
over and above the reserve fund is sufficient to meet all demands of those
requiring payment therefrom in such year, the council may dispense with the
levy of such tax.
All monies derived from the taxes levied hereunder and the following monies
shall be set apart by the treasurer of the city to constitute the police
pension fund:
   (A)   Seven percent (7%) per month, which shall be paid or deducted from the
salary of each member of the police department of the city.
   (B)   All monies that may have been accumulated by the city in conformity
with any previous laws of the state of Illinois.
"Policeman", "policemen" or "member of the police force", as used in this
chapter, shall mean any person heretofore or hereafter appointed to the police
force of a police department, and sworn and commissioned to perform police
duties. This chapter shall not apply to, nor shall any of the following persons
be deemed eligible to participate in or benefit from a police pension fund
established in a city, village or incorporated town, namely:
   (A)   Any person appointed to the police force of the police department
before he has attained his twenty first birthday, or after he has attained his
thirty sixth birthday at the time of his first appointment, except in those
cities, villages or incorporated towns which first established a pension fund
pursuant to the provisions of the statutes of Illinois, in which event all
persons employed as policemen at the time such pension fund is first
established shall be deemed eligible to participate in such pension fund,
regardless of age at first appointment, and regardless of physical condition.
This subsection shall not be construed to make ineligible a person who is, was
or shall be reappointed to the police force of the police department after he
has attained and passed his thirty sixth birthday, provided such person is
otherwise qualified, and at the time of his first appointment to such police
department was either a participant in, or eligible to participate in, any
annuity or pension fund provided for by any existing annuity or pension statute
in force at the time of his first appointment.
   (B)   Any person who shall be found upon the examination of a duly licensed
physician or physicians selected by said board of trustees to be physically
unfit or mentally unfit to perform the duties of a policeman.
   (C)   Any policeman who, within three (3) months after receiving his first
appointment, and if reappointed, also within three (3) months after his
reappointment, fails or refuses to make written application to the board of
trustees hereinafter provided for to come under the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Part time policemen, special policemen, night watchmen, temporary
employees, traffic guards or so called auxiliary policemen specially appointed
to aid or direct traffic at or near schools or public functions, or to aid in
civil defense, municipal parking lot attendants, clerks or other civilian
employees of the police department who perform clerical duties exclusively;
this chapter shall, however, apply to policemen serving initial probationary
periods, and such policemen, if otherwise eligible, shall make contributions in
the same manner as other policemen.
   (E)   Any policeman who fails or refuses to pay to the board of trustees the
salary or wage payment or deductions hereinabove defined, computed from the
date the city established a pension fund, or the date of a policeman's first
appointment (including an appointment on probation), whichever is the later,
and continuing during such policeman's entire service as a policeman. A
policeman who is reappointed shall, before being declared eligible to
participate in the pension fund, repay to the fund in the manner required by
section
6-2-14 of this chapter any refund received pursuant to the provisions of said
section
6-2-14 of this chapter. (R.O. 1959, Ch. 32, Sec. 1)
6-2-2: FELONY CONVICTION:
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, none of the benefits
herein provided for shall be paid to any person who is convicted of any felony
relating to or arising out of or in connection with his service as a policeman.
This section shall not operate to impair any contract or vested right
heretofore acquired under this chapter to preclude the right to a refund.
All future entrants shall be deemed to have consented to the provisions of this
section as a condition of coverage. (R.O. 1959, Ch. 32, Sec. 2)
6-2-3: BOARD OF TRUSTEES:
A board, composed of five (5) members, residents of the city, to be chosen as
hereinafter provided, shall be and constitute a board of trustees to provide
for the disbursement of said fund and designate the beneficiaries thereof as
herein directed, which board shall be known as the board of trustees of the
police pension fund of the city. Two (2) of said board shall be appointed by
the mayor and shall serve for a period of two (2) years each, or until such
time as their successors are appointed and qualified. The third and fourth
members of the board shall be elected from the regular police force by the
active members. The fifth member shall be elected from the beneficiaries under
the provisions of this chapter by such beneficiaries. The members to be elected
shall be elected by ballot for a term of two (2) years, beginning on the second
Tuesday of May after said election, at a regular election, as aforesaid, at
which election all members of the regular police force shall be entitled to
vote for the police force members of the board and all beneficiaries of lawful
age shall be entitled to vote for the member chosen from among the
beneficiaries. The election provided for in this section shall be held
biennially on the third Monday in April, under the Australian ballot system, at
such place or places in the city, under such regulations as shall be prescribed
by the appointed members of said board; provided, however, that no person
entitled to vote, under the provisions of this chapter, shall cast more than
one ballot at any such election. In the event of the death, resignation or
inability to act of any member of said board, elected under the provisions of
this section, the successor of such member shall be elected for the unexpired
term at a special election, which shall be called by said board and shall be
conducted in the same manner as are the annual elections provided for above.
Suitable rooms for offices and meetings of such board shall be assigned by the
council. (R.O. 1959, Ch. 32, Sec. 3)
6-2-4: WHO PENSIONED:
Whenever any person, either male or female, who, at the time of the taking
effect of this chapter is a member of any regularly constituted police force in
the city, or hereafter becomes a member of such police force, has served for a
period of twenty (20) years or more upon the regularly constituted police force
of the city, the board shall, regardless of the fact that such person may not
have arrived at the age of fifty (50) years at that time, and subject to the
provisions of this chapter, order and direct that such person, after becoming
fifty (50) years of age and his or her service on such police force having
ceased, shall be paid from such fund a yearly pension equal to one-half (1/2)
of the amount of salary attached to the rank which he or she held on such
police force for one year immediately prior to such retirement provided that
the amount of such pension shall be increased by a sum equivalent to one
percent (1%) of the salary attached to such rank for each additional year over
twenty (20) years which such person has served upon such police force, until a
maximum payment of sixty percent (60%) of the annual salary attached to the
rank held by him for one year immediately preceding his retirement. After the
decease of such member, his widow or his or her minor child or children,
dependent because of physical or mental disability regardless of age, or
dependent because of age, who survive him or her, or dependent parent or
parents, if such there be, shall be entitled to the pension provided for in
this chapter, of such deceased husband, father, son, mother, or daughter. In
case of the death of any person who has completed a minimum of twenty (20)
years' service as a member of any such police force, whether his death occurs
before or after he attained the age of fifty (50) years, or before or after
application for retirement on pension has been made, the pension to which the
decedent would have been entitled, had he or she lived and made application for
retirement on pension as of the date of death, shall be paid to his dependents
as provided in the case of the death of a pensioner. No annuity shall be paid
to any widow, child or dependent parent of a deceased member after she or he
has married or remarried after the decease of such policeman. Nor shall any
part of this section or any other section of this chapter be construed to
necessitate the retirement of any capable policeman at the age of fifty (50)
years.
In computing the time for the purpose of determining whether a policeman has
served twenty (20) years, under the provisions of this section, no furloughs
without pay exceeding thirty (30) days shall be counted, but all leaves of
absence on account of any illness of or accident occurring to any such
policeman, regardless of the length thereof, as well as all periods of
disability retirement for which such policeman shall not have received any
disability pension payments under the provisions of section
6-2-5 of this chapter shall be counted. All periods of such policeman's service
in the military, naval or air forces of the United States of America when
entered upon when he was an active policeman of the city, either on account of
any war in which the United States of America was a belligerent party, or as
required by any act of congress, shall be included and counted as a part of
such policeman's twenty (20) years' period of police service, provided that
such policeman, upon applying for such permanent pension, and in accordance
with the rules of the said board, with reference thereto, shall pay into the
fund a sum equivalent to the amount he would have contributed if he has been a
regular contributor during such period or periods of military, naval or air
service, if and to the extent that the city in which he shall have been so
acting as a policeman shall not have made such contributions to the pension
fund. (R.O. 1959, Ch. 32, Sec. 4)
6-2-5: PENSION; PHYSICAL DISABILITY:
Whenever any member of a regularly constituted police force in the city becomes
physically disabled to such an extent as to necessitate the suspending of
performance of his duty on such police force, or retirement from the police
force, he shall be paid from the fund a pension of one-half (1/2) of the salary
attached to the rank he held on the police force for one year immediately prior
to the time of his so suspending performance of his duty or retirement.
Whenever such disability ceases and the policeman resumes the performance of
his duty on the police force such pension shall cease.
If the disability continues for a period of time which, if added to the period
of his active service equals twenty (20) years, the policeman shall, if he is
then of the age of fifty (50) years, if he elects to then retire from said
police force, be paid a regular pension in lieu of such disability pension.
(R.O. 1959, Ch. 32, Sec. 5)
6-2-6: FILE CERTIFICATE OF DISABILITY:
No person shall receive any benefits from said fund, unless there shall be
filed with said board, certificates of his disability, which certificates shall
be subscribed and sworn to by said person and by two (2) practicing physicians
of the city and such board may require other evidence of disability before
ordering such payment, as aforesaid. (R.O. 1959, Ch. 32, Sec. 6)
6-2-7: PAYMENT TO WIDOW, DEPENDENTS:
Whenever any member of the police force in the city shall lose his life while
in the performance of his duty or receive injuries from which he shall
thereafter die, leaving a widow, or child, or children under the age of sixteen
(16) years, or parent who is dependent upon such policeman for maintenance and
support, then, upon satisfactory proof of such facts made to it, such board
shall order and direct that a yearly pension equal to one-half (1/2) of the
amount of salary attached to the rank which said member may have held on such
police force one year immediately prior to the time of his death, shall be paid
to such widow during her life, or if there be no widow then to such child or
children until they shall be sixteen (16) years of age, or if there be no widow
or child under the age of sixteen (16) years, then to such parents if such
there be, as is dependent upon such policeman for their support; provided, if
such widow, child or children or dependent parent shall marry, then such person
so marrying shall thereafter receive no pension from this fund; and provided,
further, that whenever any member of the police force of the city shall have
retired or shall have been retired after twenty (20) years' service or on
account of being physically disabled, shall then marry, such wife or child or
children or dependent parent of such policeman, shall after his death, receive
no pension from said fund. Whenever any member of a police force shall die
after ten (10) years' service therein and while still in the service of the
city, leaving a widow or child or children under the age of sixteen (16) or
parent dependent upon such policeman for their maintenance and support, then
upon satisfactory proof of such fact made to it, said board shall order and
direct that a pension equal to one-half (1/2) of the amount of salary attached
to the rank which such policeman may have held on such police force for one
year immediately prior to his death, shall be paid to such widow, or, if there
be no widow, then to such child or children until they shall be sixteen (16)
years of age, or if there be no widow or child under the age of sixteen (16)
years, then to such parent or parents as is or are dependent upon such
policeman for their support, said pension to cease upon the marriage, as is
heretofore provided; provided, that in case any policeman on disability pension
dies while still disabled and unable to perform the duties of his office, his
disability pension shall continue to be paid to the widow of such policeman or
his or her minor child or children, or his parent or parents, dependent upon
him because of physical or mental disability or because of age. (R.O. 1959, Ch.
32, Sec. 7)

individual, public or private corporation, government, partnership or
unincorporated association. Any reference to the masculine shall include the
feminine, and any reference to the singular shall include the plural.

knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he:
      1.   Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or
provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or
embodiment of the obscene; or

thing is obscene even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of

distribution or publicity indicate that material is being commercially
exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with

matter is utterly without redeeming social importance.

admissible to show:
      1.   The character of the audience for which the material was designed or
to which it was directed.

on the behavior of such people.
      3.   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of
the material, or absence thereof.
      4.   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
state.
      5.   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or
other promotion of the material.

6-3-5-3: HARMFUL MATERIAL:
   (A)   Elements Of The Offense: A person who with knowledge that a person is
a child, that is a person under eighteen (18) years of age, or who fails to
exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly
distributes to or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to, or offers to
distribute or exhibit any harmful material to a child, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   (B)   Definitions:
DISTRIBUTE: To transfer possession of, whether with or without consideration.
KNOWINGLY: As used in this section, means having knowledge of the contents of
the subject matter, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection
which would have disclosed the contents thereof.
MATERIAL: (A) Material is harmful if, to the average person, applying
contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to
prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or
excretion which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming
social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
   (B)   "Material", as used in this section, means any writing, picture,
record or other representation or embodiment.
   (C)   Interpretation Of Evidence: The predominant appeal to prurient
interest of the material shall be judged with reference to average children of
the same general age of the child to whom such material was offered,
distributed, sent or exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of the matter
or the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it
is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case the predominant
appeal of the material shall be judged with reference to its intended or
probable recipient group.
In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of production,
presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate the
material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal,
such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the material and can
justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is
in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal.
   (D)   Sentence: The offense of harmful material is a misdemeanor. A person
who is convicted shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred
dollars ($100.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). A second or
subsequent offense is punishable by a fine of not less than three hundred
dollars ($300.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (E)   Affirmative Defenses:
      1.   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any
library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from
circulating harmful material to any person under eighteen (18) years of age,
provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational
purpose, and it shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a
violation of this section that the act charged was committed in aid of
legitimate scientific or educational purposes.
      2.   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from distributing
to his child any harmful material.
      3.   Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance
upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child, shall be a
defense to any criminal prosecution under this section: a document issued by
the federal government or any state, county or municipal government or
subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle
operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the federal
selective service act or an identification card issued to a member of the armed
forces.
   (F)   Child Falsifying Age: Any person under eighteen (18) years of age who
falsely states, either orally or in writing, that he is not under the age of
eighteen (18) years, or who presents or offers to any person any evidence of
age and identity which is false or not actually his own for the purpose of
ordering, obtaining, viewing or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or
view any harmful material, is guilty of a misdemeanor. A person who is
convicted shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty five dollars
($25.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). (Ord. 905, 12-1-1981)

mail thereof upon the owner or owners of the building/real estate, including
the lien holders of record (as shown within the office of the Fulton County
Land Records or Recorder’s Office) and upon persons in apparent possession of
the premises.
Where, upon diligent search, the identity or whereabouts of the owner or owners
of any such building, including the lien holders of record is not
ascertainable, notice mailed to the person or persons in whose name such real
estate was last assessed for general real estate taxes is sufficient notice
under this section.
The notice shall briefly and concisely specify the defect(s) or condition(s) of
the building or structure which renders it dangerous or unsafe. The notice
shall further specify that the owners must make the building safe (by complete
elimination of any unsafe conditions) or demolish the building at the owner’s
cost within fifteen (15) days upon receipt of the notice (the “15-day Notice
Period”). The notice may allow for more than fifteen (15) days under said 15-
day Notice Period, if the City desires.
In the event the owner or owners fail to make the building safe or commence and
complete demolition within the 15-day Notice Period, the city attorney is
hereby authorized to commence a civil action in the circuit court of Fulton
County seeking a court order (1) authorizing the demolition or repair of the
building or structure subject to the notice provided for by this chapter or (2)
requiring the owner or owners of record to demolish, repair, or enclose such
building and to create the lien described in section
6-18-7  herein. It shall not be a defense to this cause of action that the
building is boarded up or otherwise enclosed, although the court may order the
building boarded up or otherwise enclosed. It further shall not be a defense
that the building is put in a safe condition during the pendency of the civil
action.
Joined as defendants in said cause shall be the owner or owners of record, lien
holders of record, and other parties having an interest in the property as
shown by documents recorded in the office of the Fulton County recorder of
deeds on the date of the filing of the complaint for demolition. (Ord. 1244, 5-
16-1989; amd. Ord. 4236, 5-18-2021)
6-18-5: LIS PENDENS NOTICE:
Upon the commencement of the civil action set forth in section
6-18-4 of this chapter, a lis pendens notice designating the property upon
which the subject building is located shall be filed with the recorder of
deeds. Failure to file or the improper filing of the lis pendens notice does
not, however, affect the civil action for demolition. Any person obtaining or
recording in said office an interest in the property after such filing may
become party to the civil action only if he intervenes by order of the court.
(Ord. 1244, 5-16-1989)
6-18-6: PLACARDING OF BUILDING OR STRUCTURE:
Whenever any dwelling or building has been designated a "dangerous building" or
contains unsafe conditions, the chief of police or his designee shall placard
the building indicating that the condition is dangerous and unsafe. It shall be
unlawful for any person to rent, cause to rent, to occupy or allow another to
occupy any premises, knowing that said premises has been designated a
"dangerous building".
It shall be unlawful for any persons to remove, cause to remove or cover up in
any way any placard designating a building or structure a "dangerous building".
A violation of this section shall be punishable by a fine not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) and not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or
by imprisonment for a period not to exceed six (6) months, or by both such fine
and imprisonment. (Ord. 1244, 5-16-1989)
6-18-7: DEMOLITION LIEN, PERSONAL JUDGMENT:
The cost of the demolition, repair, enclosure, or removal incurred by the city,
including court costs, attorney’s fees, and other costs related to the
enforcement of this chapter, is recoverable from the owner or owners of the
real estate or the previous owner or both if the property was transferred
during the 15-day Notice Period and is a lien on the real estate. Said lien is
superior to all prior existing liens and encumbrances, except taxes, if, within
one hundred eighty (180) days after the repair, demolition, enclosure, or
removal, the city files a notice of lien for the cost and expense incurred in
the office of the Fulton County recorder of deeds. The notice of lien shall
consist of a sworn statement setting out (1) a description of the real estate
sufficient for its identification, (2) the amount of money representing the
cost and expense incurred, and (3) the date or dates when the cost and expense
was incurred by the city. Upon payment of said cost and expense of demolition
or repair by the owner of or persons interested in the property after the
notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the city attorney.
The lien may be enforced by foreclosure proceedings as in the case of mortgage
foreclosures or mechanics’ lien foreclosures. An action to foreclose this lien
may be commenced at any time after the date of the filing of the notice of
lien. The costs of foreclosure incurred by the city, including court costs,
reasonable attorney’s fees, advances to preserve the property, and other costs
related to the enforcement of this chapter, plus statutory interest, are a lien
on the real estate and are recoverable by the city from the owner or owners of
the real estate. Suit to foreclose this lien shall be commenced by the city
attorney within three (3) years after the date of the filing of the notice of
lien.
Any liens arising under this chapter shall be assignable by the city. The
assignee of the lien shall have the same power to enforce the lien as the city,
except the lien may not be enforced under Section 11-31-1(c) of the Illinois
Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-31-1).
If payment of the city's cost of demolition or repair is not paid to the city
within fifteen (15) days of the filing of the notice of lien, the city attorney
may commence proceedings in the circuit court seeking a personal judgment from
the owner of the subject property at the time the complaint for demolition was
filed with the circuit clerk in the amount of said costs. The action authorized
by this paragraph shall be in addition to, and without waiver of, any other
remedies authorized and available by law. (Ord. 1244, 5-16-1989; amd. Ord.
4236, 5-18-2021)
6-18-8: NUISANCE STRUCTURES:
Any unsafe, dilapidated or abandoned building, house, barn or other structure
situated within the limits of the city is, and the same is hereby declared to
be, a nuisance.
If any such building or structure is being constructed, altered, enlarged or
repaired and the building permit issued for said building or structure expires
or is revoked by the building official, and the owner of the building or
structure fails within thirty (30) days of the revocation or expiration to
obtain a certificate of occupancy as provided by this code or to obtain another
building permit, then that building or structure shall remain a declared
nuisance.
The penalty for maintaining a nuisance shall be as provided in this code, and
each and every day that such nuisance remains unabated shall constitute a new
and separate offense. (Ord. 1244, 5-16-1989)
6-18-9: INTERACTION WITH STATE LAW:
Nothing in this Title 6, Chapter 18 shall be construed to limit the city’s
ability to proceed with the demolition, repair, enclosure of dangerous and
unsafe buildings or uncompleted and abandoned buildings pursuant to Section 11-
31-1 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-31-1) or any of the
provisions thereunder. The city has the option to proceed with any such actions
under this chapter or the Illinois Municipal Code.
Furthermore, nothing in Title 6, Chapter 18 shall be construed nor is intended
to conflict with Section 11-31-1 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-
31-1). However, whenever any provision of this chapter conflicts with the
requirements, regulations, restrictions or limitations that are imposed or
required by Section 11-31-1 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-31-1),
then the provisions provided for in the Illinois Municipal Code shall prevail.

charge or control of the real or personal property which has become a nuisance
is unknown or cannot readily be found, the municipal officer with police power
may proceed to abate such nuisance without notice. Where the abatement of the
nuisance requires continuing acts by the corporate authorities beyond the

shall seek abatement of such nuisance on a permanent basis through judicial
process as soon as reasonably possible. (Ord. 1193, 5-3-1988)

All places and the fixtures and movable contents thereof, used for the purpose
of unlawfully selling, serving, storing, hereby keeping, giving away or using

hereinafter provided and the owners, agents, occupants of and any other person
using any such place may be enjoined as hereinafter provided. (Ord. 1193, 5-3-
1988)
7-1-3-3: FILING COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTION, PROCEDURE; LESSEE TO BE PARTY
DEFENDANT:
The city attorney may file a complaint in the name of the city, to enjoin all
persons from maintaining or permitting such nuisance, to abate the same and to
enjoin the use of any such place for the period of one year.
Upon the filing of a complaint by the city attorney in which the complaint
states that irreparable injury, loss or damage will result to the city, the
court shall enter a temporary restraining order without notice enjoining the
maintenance of such nuisance, upon affidavit or testimony under oath,
sufficient, if sustained, to justify the court in entering a preliminary
injunction upon a hearing after notice. Every such temporary restraining order
entered without notice shall be endorsed with the date and hour of entry of the
order, shall be filed of record, and shall expire by its terms within such time
after entry, not to exceed ten (10) days as fixed by the court, unless the
temporary restraining order for good cause is extended for a like period or
unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be
extended for a longer period. The reason for extension shall be shown in the
order. In case a temporary restraining order is entered without notice, the
motion for a permanent injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest
possible time and takes precedence over all matters except older matters of the
same character, and when the motion comes on for hearing, the city attorney
shall proceed with the application for a permanent injunction, and, if he does
not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On two (2)
days' written notice to the city attorney the defendant may appear and move the
dissolution or modification of such temporary restraining order and in that
event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as
expeditiously as the ends of justice require.
Upon the filing of the complaint by the city attorney (in cases in which the
city attorney does not request injunctive relief without notice) in the circuit
court, the court, if satisfied that the nuisance complained of exists, shall
allow a temporary restraining order, without bond, enjoining the defendant from
maintaining any such nuisance within the jurisdiction of the court granting the
injunctive relief. However, no such injunctive relief shall be granted unless
it be made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that the owner or agent
of such place knew or had been personally served with a notice signed by the
plaintiff and, that such notice has been served upon such owner or such agent
of such place at least five (5) days prior thereto, that such place,
specifically describing the same, was being so used, naming the date or dates
of its being so used, and that such owner or agent had failed to abate such
nuisance, or that upon diligent inquiry such owner or agent could not be found
within the city for the service of such preliminary notice. The lessee, if any,
of such place shall be made a party defendant to such petition. (Ord. 1193, 5-
3-1988)
7-1-3-4: EVIDENCE, HEARING, DISMISSAL, COSTS:
The defendant shall be held to answer the allegations of the complaint as in
other civil proceedings. At all hearings upon the merits, evidence of the
general reputation of such place, of the inmates thereof, and of those
resorting thereto, shall be admissible for the purpose of proving the existence
of such nuisance. The cause shall be heard immediately upon issue being joined.
(Ord. 1193, 5-3-1988)
7-1-3-5: INTERROGATORIES, REFUSAL TO ANSWER, CONTEMPT:
The plaintiff at any time before, but not later than ten (10) days after, the
filing of the answer, unless further time be granted by the court, may file
interrogatories in writing concerning matters material to the allegations of
the complaint or respecting the ownership of the property upon which it is
claimed the nuisance is maintained. A full answer to each interrogatory under
the oath of the defendant shall be filed with the clerk within ten (10) days
after a copy of the interrogatories has been served upon him. For a failure to
so answer interrogatories the court may strike the answer to the complaint from
the files and enter an order of default and final judgment, and a rule to
answer interrogatories may be entered and the court may punish a defendant for
contempt of court for a refusal to obey such rule. No person shall be excused
from answering interrogatories under oath on the ground that the answer may
tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. The answer
shall be evidence against, but not on behalf of, the defendant and it shall not
be used against him in any criminal proceeding nor shall he be prosecuted or
subjected to a penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction,
matter or thing disclosed by him in such answer responsive to the
interrogatories. (Ord. 1193, 5-3-1988)
7-1-3-6: JUDGMENT:
If the existence of the nuisance is established, the court shall enter a
judgment perpetually restraining all persons from maintaining or permitting
such nuisance, and from using the place in which the same is maintained for any
purpose for a period of one year thereafter, unless such judgment is sooner
vacated, as hereinafter provided, and perpetually restraining the defendant
from maintaining any such nuisance within the jurisdiction of the court. While
the judgment remains in effect, such place shall be in the custody of the
court. An order of abatement shall also be entered as a part of such judgment,
which order shall direct the department to remove from such place all fixtures
and movable property used in conducting or aiding or abetting such nuisance,
and to sell the same in the manner provided by law for the sale of chattels in
the enforcement of a judgment for the payment of money, and to close such place
against its use for any purpose, and to keep it closed for a period of one year
unless sooner released as hereinafter provided. The department's fees for
removing and selling the movable property shall be taxed as a part of the
costs, and shall be the same as those for levying upon and selling like
property in the enforcement of a judgment for the payment of money. For closing
the place and keeping it closed, the court shall allow a reasonable fee to be
taxed as part of the costs; provided, that no injunction shall be entered
against an owner, nor shall an order be entered requiring that any place be
closed or kept closed, if it appears that such owner and his agent have in good
faith endeavored to prevent such nuisance or did not have knowledge of such
nuisance except in cases in which the city attorney states in his complaint
that immediate and irreparable injury will result to the city, then a
preliminary injunction may be entered. Nothing in this section contained shall
authorize any relief respecting any other place than that in which such
nuisance exists. (Ord. 1193, 5-3-1988)
7-1-3-7: PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF PROPERTY, DISPOSITION:
The proceeds of the sale of the movable property shall be applied in payment of
the costs of the proceeding, and the balance, if any, shall be paid to the city
treasurer for deposit in the police protection fund of the city. (Ord. 1193, 5-
3-1988)
7-1-3-8: PROSECUTION FOR VIOLATION OF INJUNCTION OR ABATEMENT ORDER:
In case of the violation of any injunction or order of abatement issued under
the provisions of this section, the court may summarily try and punish the
offender for his contempt of court. The hearing may be had upon affidavits, or
either party may demand the production and oral examination of witnesses. (Ord.
1193, 5-3-1988)
7-1-3-9: RELEASE OF PREMISES:
If the owner of the place has not been guilty of any contempt of court in the
proceedings, and appears and pays all costs, fees, and allowances that are a
lien on the place and files a bond in the full value of the property, to be
ascertained by the court, with sureties, to be approved by the court
conditioned that he will immediately abate any such nuisance that may exist at
the place and prevent it from being established or kept therein within a period
of one year thereafter, the court may, if satisfied of good faith, order the
place to be delivered to the owner and the order of abatement canceled so far
as it may relate to such place. The release of such place under the provisions
of this section does not release it from any judgment, lien, or liability to
which it may be subject. (Ord. 1193, 5-3-1988)
7-1-3-10: FINE AND COSTS TO BE LIEN AGAINST PROPERTY:
Whenever a fine or costs shall be assessed under the provisions of this section
7-1-3 against the owner of any property herein declared to be a nuisance, such
fine or costs shall constitute a lien upon such property to the extent of the
interest of such owner, and an order of execution shall issue thereon. (Ord.
1193, 5-3-1988)
7-1-3-11: LEASES, VOID AT OPTION OF LESSOR:
If any lessee or occupant shall use leased premises for the purpose of unlawful
using, keeping or selling controlled substances or shall permit them to be used
for any such purposes, the lease or contract for letting such premises shall,
at the option of the lessor, become void, and the owner may have the like
remedy to recover possession thereof as against a tenant holding over after the
expiration of his term. (Ord. 1193, 5-3-1988)
7-1-3-12: APPLICATION OF SECTION:
Nothing contained in this section
7-1-3 shall apply to any unlawful act which results from failing to comply with
the provisions prescribed in the "Illinois controlled substances act", enacted
by the 77th general assembly. (Ord. 1193, 5-3-1988)
7-1-3-13: PENALTY:
Violations of this section
7-1-3 shall be governed by title 1, chapter 27, "General Penalty", of this code

police officer to seize such property without further process.
Seizure by a police officer may be made without process:
      1.   If there is probable cause to believe that the property is directly
dangerous to health or safety and existing circumstances do not allow
reasonable time for the officer to obtain lawful process; or
      2.   In accordance with the provisions of the code of criminal procedure
of 1963, as amended.

of the seizure has been determined in a circuit court, unless such court upon
application therefor, orders the sale of perishable substances and the deposit
of the proceeds of the sale with the clerk of the court. The circuit court
shall rule on the validity of the seizure within thirty (30) days after the
seizure, unless a continuance is obtained by a person from whom the items were
seized or a person who otherwise has standing to complain, or by the city for
good cause shown. In no event shall a continuance granted to the city pursuant
to this section
7-1-4 extend beyond thirty (30) days. If judgment is entered in favor of the
person from whom the property is seized, all seized property shall be returned
immediately. Appeals from orders of the circuit court shall be heard within
sixty (60) days from the date judgment is entered. Judgments in favor of the
person entitled to possession of the subject property shall serve as a mandate
to the agency holding said property to return same forthwith.

7-1-4 the chief administrative officer of the seizing department or agency may
retain it for official use, or forward it to the bureau of narcotics and

for disposition. (Ord. 1194, 5-3-1988)
7-1-4-5: LEGISLATIVE INTENT, INFERENCE OF LEGITIMACY:

particular property or place in violation of this code. (Ord. 1195, 5-3-1988)
7-1-5-2: APPLICATION FOR SEARCH WARRANT:
The application for a search warrant shall be made through the office of the

      7.   Disinterment: No disinterment or removal shall be made except by the
management on request of the person(s) with legal authority to direct the same,
or by court order prior to time of removal. At least seventy two (72) hours'
notice shall be given prior to any removal. The removal will be made at the
convenience of the management, with consideration to inclement weather, weather
predictions, and interment schedules. The management may defer an interment or
disinterment until a more appropriate time for any reason. All fees associated
with any disinterment shall be paid in full prior to the service being
provided.
The cemetery shall exercise due care in making disinterments, but shall assume
no liability for damage to any body, casket, outer burial receptacle, or urn in
making a disinterment. When a disinterment is to be made from one grave to
another grave and an outer burial container was not used for the original
interment, an outer burial container meeting the cemetery's specifications must
be furnished by the owner or next of kin for the new interment.
The cemetery may require that all persons attending an interment or
disinterment remain at safe distance, as determined by the management, from the
interment space during the interment or disinterment.
      8.   Errors May Be Corrected: The management reserves, and shall have,
the right to correct any errors that may be made by it either in making burials
or removals, or in the description, either by canceling such conveyance and
substituting and conveying in lieu thereof other interment property, of equal
value and similar location as far as possible, or as may be selected by the
management, or by refunding the amount of money paid on account of said
purchase. In the event the error shall involve the burial of the remains of any
person in such property, the management reserves, and shall have, the right to
remove and bury the remains in such other property of equal value and similar
location as may be substituted and conveyed in lieu thereof. The management
shall also have the right to correct any errors made by placing an improper
inscription, including an incorrect name and/or date, either on the memorial or
on the container for cremated remains. The cemetery shall have no liability as
a result of any errors of the type described herewith other than its obligation
to take the remedial actions described.

of Canton will be observed by the cemetery. These include, but are not limited
to, days in observance of New Year's Day, Martin Luther King's Birthday,
Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,
Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. When any holiday falls, or
is observed, on a Saturday or Monday, arrangements for an interment must be
provided by the last weekday preceding the holiday.
      10.   Identity: The management assumes no duty for identity of the
remains of the deceased, and can give no assurance that the remains interred
are that of the person shown on the interment authorization executed and
delivered to the management. The management relies upon the representation of
family, funeral director, or others making such statements of identity for
interment authorization, burial permits, or death certificates, and shall have
no obligation to independently establish or verify the identity of the remains.
      11.   Interment Of Pets: No pets shall be interred in the cemetery,
either alone or with human remains.
      12.   Interment - Right Of Descent: If no interment is made in an
interment lot which has been transferred by deed or certificate of ownership to
an individual owner, or if all remains previously interred are lawfully
removed, upon the death of the owner, unless he has disposed of the lot either
in his will by a specific devise or by a written declaration filed and recorded
in the office of the cemetery authority, the interment rights descend to the
heirs at law of the owner subject to the rights of interment of the decedent
and his surviving spouse provided for in these rules and regulations.
      13.   Interment Space - Location: When instructions from the lot owner
regarding the location of an interment space in a lot cannot be obtained, or
are indefinite, or when for any reason the interment space cannot be opened
where specified, the management may, in its discretion, open it in such
location in the plot as it deems best and proper, so as not to delay the
funeral; and the management shall not be liable in damages for any error so
made.
      14.   Inurnment Container Specifications: All cremated remains to be
inurned in the cemetery shall be placed in a sealed, permanent, retrievable
container of a type, quality and construction approved by the management. A
temporary cremation container by definition is not a permanent retrievable
container. The use of paper, cardboard, or other similar biodegradable
materials shall not be permitted.
      15.   Laws: In addition to being subject to these rules and regulations,
all burials and removals are made subject to the orders and laws of the
properly constituted authorities of the City, County and State.
      16.   Liability - No Liability For Damage During Removal: The cemetery
shall not be liable for damage to any casket, burial case, or urn occurring
during the removal thereof.
      17.   Lot Sale Policy: All interment rights on pinned or platted lots
within Greenwood Cemetery are considered "for sale" unless determined by
Greenwood Cemetery to be unusable due to physical barriers such as trees,
roots, infrastructure, utilities, etc. No useable lots or blocks may be held,
reserved or restricted for the convenience of any family or individual, unless
that family or individual owns the interment rights for said lot(s) or block.
Greenwood Cemetery may at its discretion allow a maximum of a thirty (30) day
"courtesy hold" without a deposit, on a lot(s) for a family needing time to
make a purchase decision.
      18.   Lot Owners - Property Rights Of: Only the right to inter is
conveyed. Greenwood Cemetery retains all other interest in the space, crypt, or
niche conveyed. All interment rights conveyed to individuals are the sole and
separate property of the owner named in the instrument of conveyance.
Successors in interest shall be determined as follows: The spouse of an owner
of any lot containing more than one interment space has a vested right of
interment of his/her remains in the lot and any person thereafter becoming the
spouse of the owner has a vested right of interment of his/her remains in the
lot if more than one interment space is unoccupied at the time the person
becomes the spouse of the owner.
No conveyance or other action of the owner without the written consent of
joinder of the spouse of the owner divests the spouse of a vested right of
interment, except that a final decree of divorce between them terminates the
vested right of interment unless otherwise provided in the decree.
In a conveyance to two (2) or more persons as joint tenants, each joint tenant
has a vested right of interment in the lot conveyed. Upon the death of a joint
tenant, the title to the lot held in joint tenancy immediately vests in the
survivors, subject to the vested right of interment of the remains of the
deceased joint tenant.
A vested right of interment may be waived and is terminated upon the interment
elsewhere of the remains of the person in whom vested.
An affidavit by a person having knowledge of the facts setting forth the fact
of the death of the owner and the name of the person or persons entitled to the
use of the lot is complete authorization to the cemetery to permit the use of
the unoccupied portions of the lot by the person entitled to the use of it.
An affidavit by any person having knowledge of the facts setting forth the fact
of the death of one joint tenant and establishing the identity of the surviving
joint tenants named in the deed to any lot, when filed with the cemetery, is
complete authorization to the cemetery to permit the use of the unoccupied
portion of the lot in accordance with the directions of the surviving joint
tenants or their successors in interest.
When there are several owners of a lot, or of right of interment in it, they
may designate one or more persons to represent the lot and file written notice
of designation with the management. In the absence of such notice or of written
objection to its so doing, the cemetery is not liable to any owner for
interring or permitting an interment in the lot upon the request or direction
of any co-owner of the lot.
No vested right of interment gives to any person the right to have his/her
remains interred in any interment space in which the remains of any deceased
person having a prior vested right of interment have been interred, without
acquisition of a second/third right of interment.
      19.   Notice: Forty eight (48) hours' notice, Sundays and holidays
excluded, must be given to the management before any burial. The management is
authorized to refuse interment in, or the erection of any memorial work on any
lot against which there is an unpaid balance or no endowment care. The
potential waiver of the required notice will be considered on a case by case
basis and will be subject to additional fees.
No disinterment or removal shall be made except by the management on request of
the person(s) with legal authority to direct the same, or by court order prior
to time of removal. At least seventy two (72) hours' notice shall be given
prior to any removal. The removal will be made at the convenience of the
management, with consideration to inclement weather and weather predictions.
The management may defer an interment until a more expedient time for any
reason.
      20.   Protection Against Loss Or Damage: The management shall have the
right to maintain guard at the cemetery at any time of its choosing. The
management shall have no liability for loss or damage and especially from
damage caused by the elements, and act of God, common enemy, thieves, vandals,
strikers, malicious mischief makers, explosions, accidents, invasions,
insurrections, riots, or order of any military or civil authority, whether the
damage be direct or collateral, including the loss of human remains, under any
circumstances.
      21.   Right To Replat, Regrade, And Use Property: The management shall
have the right and privilege, at any time and from time to time, to resurvey,
enlarge, diminish, replat, alter in shape or size, or otherwise change all or
any part, portion or subdivision of the property hereby mapped and platted,
including the right to lay out, establish, close, eliminate, or otherwise
modify or change the location of roads, walks, or drives, and amend maps or
plats, and to use the same for the erection of buildings, or for any purposes
or uses connected with, incident to or convenient for the care, preservation or
preparation for the interment of human remains or other cemetery purposes,
together with easements and right-of-way over and through said premises for,

conduits or drains for sprinklers, drainage, electric or communication lines,

individual lot owners for the burial of human remains, or for anything
necessary, incidental or convenient thereto. The management reserves to itself
the perpetual right of ingress and egress over the cemetery for the purpose of
passage to and from other lots.
      22.   Removal For Personal Gain Prohibited: Removal of a body or cremated
remains so that a space, lot, crypt, or niche may be sold or used for personal
gain is not allowed. Removal contrary to the express or implied wish of the
original owner is forbidden, unless the cemetery is directed to do so by court
order.

these rules and regulations, and any amendments thereto shall be the sole and
only agreement between the cemetery and the lot owner. The statements of any
employee and/or sales agents shall in no way bind the management.
      27.   Substitution In The Event Of Size: Spaces and crypts are laid out,
designed, and constructed based upon recognized industry standards. In the
event, because of an oversized or overweight deceased person, or because of
disfigurement, such human remains cannot be interred within the confines of
such standard spaces or crypts, then the management reserves the right to
relocate the human remains, and to substitute the interment site to accommodate
such circumstances.

accomplished through the execution of a quit claim. This quit claim must be

or lot, authorization shall be obtained from the cemetery office. No memorial

and an interment has not, or will not take place at that specific grave lot,
and inscription stating "In Memory of" may be placed on the marker, so as to
not falsely represent an interment within that lot. With an inscription of "In

cleaning memorials (not connected with established retail dealers already doing

the work for which they have been engaged before being allowed to commence work
in the cemetery. In addition, these persons or firms shall provide to the
management of the cemetery proof of general liability, workers' compensation,
and products liability insurance satisfactory to the management. Said insurance
certification shall provide that the insurance carrier must give thirty (30)
days' written notice to the management in the event the insurance is canceled.
         (c)   Persons engaged in erecting memorials, or other structures, are
prohibited from attaching ropes to monuments, trees, shrubs, or from scattering
their material over adjoining lots, or from blocking streets, avenues, or

shrubs as possible, and must remove all debris and restore the ground and sod
to its original condition.

         (a)   Greenwood Cemetery strives to ensure the safety of both visitors
and our workers. We thank you for abiding by the following rules and
regulations.
            (1)   For the safety of all in the cemetery no glass containers,
statuary, ceramics, terra cotta, resin, exposed wire, toys, balloons, pinwheels
or breakable items are permitted at any time. They will be removed and
discarded.
            (2)   No more than three (3) floral arrangements per interment
right are allowed. The excess will be removed and discarded.
            (3)   Grave blanket, half blankets, wreaths, and bouquets are

spikes. Blankets with metal spikes are not allowed.
            (4)   Anything deemed by the management to be breakable and a
possible hazard shall be removed for the safety of all.
            (5)   Monuments and flush markers are placed at the very head/top
of each grave. Flowers and shepherd's hooks are not to be placed above/behind
the monument or marker. This would, in effect, be in someone else's grave.
            (6)   Temporary cones, wreaths and sprays are only permitted if
placed directly in line with the monuments, either at the side or in front of
the monument or marker. Flowers incorrectly placed on another grave will be
removed and discarded.

            (12)   The cemetery is not responsible for theft or damage to any
personal property or floral arrangements placed on or near interment rights or
elsewhere in the cemetery.
            (13)   Please observe the speed limit of fifteen (15) miles per
hour and do not drive or park on the grass or sidewalks.
            (14)   Thank you for your cooperation.
         (b)   The management shall not be responsible for lost, misplaced, or
broken flower vases. The management shall not be responsible for any ground
level wreath, spray, floral decorations, plants, or decorations of any kind
damaged by the elements, thieves, vandals, or routine maintenance. The
management reserves the right to regulate the method of decorating lots so that
a uniform beauty may be maintained. Management reserves the right to remove any
and all arrangements that, in its opinion, are in inferior condition or out of
season.
      4.   Plantings: The cemetery shall have sole and exclusive authority with
respect to the planting, sodding, surveying, and improvements within the
cemetery.
No plantings of any trees, shrubs, flowers or bulbs will be allowed in the
cemetery without the written permission of the management and without
specification by management as to the kind and location of such planting. Any
placed without permission is subject to removal by management.
In every case the charges therefor shall be paid in advance or arrangements
satisfactory to the management made concerning payment, including but not
limited to, any other outstanding charges on that particular lot or space.
The management shall provide for the planting of all nursery items unless other
arrangements satisfactory to the cemetery are made. Plantings shall be made at
such times as the management may permit, dependent upon committal services and

part of a lot at any time, without the written approval of the management.
   (G)   Transfer Or Assignments:

original lot owner or from anyone else in connection with an interment,
purchase of the lot, or for any other reason.
      2.   Interment Rights Conveyed By Deeds: Interment rights will be
conveyed to the purchaser(s) by a Cemetery Deed. No deed for any interment
right shall be issued nor shall any right of ownership pass to the purchaser
(s), until the purchase price is paid in full.
      3.   Recording Of Lots And Burials: Complete records of all lot owners
and interments will be kept at the cemetery office. Because the cemetery is a
Municipal cemetery and City records are public, information about property
owners and interments shall be provided to those who inquire. Record requests
may be subject to an administrative fee, which may be charged from time to time
by management.
      4.   Transfer And Assignments: For the protection of lot owners of the
cemetery, and to prevent unauthorized transfers and interments, the management
shall have complete records of the ownership of all lots in the cemetery.
Therefore, the following restrictions are necessary and mandatory concerning
sales, transfers, and assignment of all lots: No person shall sell, transfer or
assign any lot or any interest therein without complying with this rule, and
all sales, assignments and transfers contrary to the terms of this rule are
void and of no effect, and will not be recognized by the management. Any person
desiring to sell, transfer or assign any lot, or any interest therein, shall
convey, transfer and assign such lot or their interest unto the cemetery, and
the management will, after checking its records or making such other
investigation as it may deem necessary, issue to the person(s) to whom the lot
owner desires to sell, transfer or convey such lot, or any interest therein, a
Cemetery Deed. Any sale, transfer, or assignment of interment rights must
follow any restrictions within the cemetery.
Interment rights shall be purchased solely for the purpose of personal or
family interment or the interment of the person designated in the purchase
agreement, and not for purposes of speculation. The price received for the sale
of any lots, graves, crypts, or niches cannot exceed the current selling price
of like property by the cemetery.
   (H)   Modifications And Amendments:
      1.   Amendments: The management may, and it hereby expressly reserves the
right, at any time or times, to adopt new rules and regulations, or to amend,
alter or repeal any rule, regulation, article, section, paragraph or sentence
in these rules and regulations.
      2.   Exceptions And Modifications: No waiver of any violation of these
rules and regulations shall operate as a waiver of any subsequent violation of
the same rule or regulation or as a waiver of any other rule or regulation, or
the violation thereof.
Special cases may arise in which the literal enforcement of a rule may impose
unnecessary hardship. The management therefore, reserves the right, without
notice, to make exceptions, suspensions, or modifications in any of these rules
and regulations when, in its judgment, the same appear advisable; and such
temporary exception, suspension or modification shall in no way be construed as
affecting the general application of such rules.

declared invalid, such declaration shall not affect or invalidate the remaining
rules and regulations or parts thereof herewith established.

8-10-3: SEWER AND WATER TAPS:
In every case when any person desires to make a connection with any water or
sewer main of the city, such connection shall be made in the following manner:
   (A)   Water Taps; Tap Fees And Installation Procedure For Water Service: The
property owner shall first make written application to the city for tappage and
installation of form as provided by the city. Thereafter, the property owner
desiring such connection shall cause all excavation and preparation for the
same to be made at his sole expense and in accordance with applicable codes.
The city will make the actual tap and install the corporation stop in
accordance with the following fee schedule and charge the same to the owner.
The owner shall supply all copper tubing for the service connection. The owner
shall cause all copper pipe, the curb stop and box, and remaining pipe to the
building to be installed at his sole expense and in accordance with applicable
city codes. If tappage involves excavation in a road right of way, such
excavation shall be backfilled with granular fill and to the city's
satisfaction. If a boring is necessary to cross paved streets, such boring
shall be done at the owner's expense and to the city's satisfaction. The city
will install the water meter as soon as construction permits. No water shall be
used until the water meter is installed by the city, except as hereinafter
provided. If any water is to be used prior to the installation of the water
meter, charges therefor shall be in accordance with section
8-10-16 of this chapter. Such fee shall be for a ninety (90) day period, and in
all cases, shall be paid in advance of each such ninety (90) day period. In
cases where the building site is already served by a water tap, the appropriate
tap fees shall be charged to the owner. The water tap fees include, but are not
limited to: 1) the actual cost of the equipment plus twenty percent (20%); 2)
city labor for the tapping of the water line; and 3) city inspection fee. The
city billing clerk will maintain the schedule of the water tap fees. In no case
shall the work and installation of lines, tappage and other associated
excavation be backfilled prior to the city's inspection and approval of such
work and tappage.
   (B)   Sewer Taps; Tap Fees And Installation Procedure For Sewer Service:
Sewer tap fees shall be charged to each property owner desiring sewer service
in accordance with the fee schedule maintained by the city billing clerk. All
fees shall be paid in advance. The sewer tap fee will be determined by the
public works director.
The property owner shall first make written application to the city for tappage
and installation on forms provided by the city. Thereafter, the property owner
desiring such connection shall cause all excavation and preparation for the
same to be made at his sole expense and in accordance with applicable codes.
The property owner shall cause his plumber to make the actual tap; then a
saddle must be used. The saddle must first be approved by the city engineer or
plumbing inspector and then installed to his satisfaction.
The owner shall, at his sole expense, cause all excavation and backfill to be
done. If the tap is made in road right of way, such excavation shall be
backfilled with a granular material and to the city's satisfaction. If a boring
is necessary to cross paved streets, such boring, backfill and patching of
pavement shall be done at the owner's sole expense and to the city's
satisfaction. In no case shall the work and installation of lines, tappage, and
other associated excavation be backfilled prior to the city's inspection and
approval of such work and tappage. The city will assist in locating existing
city owned sewers; provided, however, that the property owner requesting
tappage and sewer service shall be solely responsible for the cost of such work
and the physical completion of the work.
   (C)   Water And Sewer Tap Fees Outside The Corporate Limits Of The City: The
fees for water and sewer taps for locations outside the corporate limits of the
city shall be double those described in subsections (A) and (B) of this

officers need replacement, shall be paid for by the consumer.
All meters before being set in must be tested and approved by the building
official. No meter shall be removed for any purpose from any supply pipe by any
person whatsoever, without first obtaining a written permit from the building
official. Anywhere any meter is removed by such consent, it must be replaced
within ten (10) days, and before being replaced it must be tested by the
building official. (Ord. 3097, 4-8-2015)

use or metered sewer use (if available) or by an estimate of water used as
determined by the superintendent.
   (F)   Reserved. (Ord. 3065, 6-3-2014)
   (G)   Extra Strength Surcharge: Service charges and volume charges as
specified in subsection (E) of this section shall be considered to be payment
for collection and treatment of all sewage of strengths up to concentrations of
two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) BOD and two hundred forty
milligrams per liter (240 mg/l) suspended solids. An additional extra strength
surcharge shall be charged in the event that a user discharges wastes of
strengths in excess of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) BOD and two
hundred forty milligrams per liter (240 mg/l) suspended solids as shown below.
 
BOD $0.120/#
SS  0.125/#
 
These surcharges shall be applicable to 1989. Beyond 1989, the city will
determine annually, costs per pound for treatment of excess concentrations of
BOD and suspended solids for the purposes of assessing extra strength
surcharges as those users who may be discharging such wastes. The unit costs,
for this purpose, will be computed on the following basis:
      1.   The total annual cost of collection and treatment shall be
determined from information contained in the official audit prepared for the
last preceding fiscal year. In determining the amount of audited expenses
allocable to the operation of the sewer department, the following items will be
considered:
         (a)   One-half (1/2) the total expense of the combined waterworks and
sewerage system for accounting and collection costs.
         (b)   One-half (1/2) the total expense of the combined waterworks and
sewerage system for general and administrative costs.
         (c)   Total audited value for sewer expense, including all operation
and maintenance expenses for the sewerage system and for sewage treatment.
         (d)   Sixty two percent (62%) of the past year's principal and
interest costs on 1963 waterworks and sewerage revenue bonds so long as said
bonds are outstanding.
         (e)   Principal and interest cost on all outstanding general
obligation sewer bonds and obligations so long as said bonds and obligations
are outstanding.
In addition to the items listed above obtained from the official audit, an item
of depreciation shall be included. This item shall be determined at twenty
percent (20%) of a total annual depreciation amount as approved by region V,
United States environmental protection agency for the various items included in
all improvements to the sewage treatment facilities to the extent such
improvements are not fully depreciated.
      2.   The annual average daily dry weather flow, BOD and suspended solids
for untreated wastes received at the treatment plants, computed from treatment
records by omitting values for days in which rainfall contributed to flow.
Values for BOD and for suspended solids shall be computed on the basis of the
total number of pounds received at the treatment plants.
      3.   From data obtained in subsections (G)1 and (G)2 of this section, the
total annual cost per pound of BOD treatment and per pound of suspended solids
treated shall be computed.
In making these calculations, the total annual cost obtained as outlined in
subsection (G)1 of this section shall be apportioned as follows:
40 percent of total assigned to volume
30 percent of total assigned to BOD
30 percent of total assigned to suspended solids
      4.   In calculating extra strength surcharges applicable to any
particular user, data shall be obtained pertaining to the volume of wastes
discharged and to the BOD and suspended solids applicable to such wastes.
Credit shall be given for BOD up to two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l)
and for suspended solids up to two hundred forty milligrams per liter (240 mg/
l) being included under the service charge and volume charge. For strengths in
excess of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) BOD and two hundred forty
milligrams per liter (240 mg/l) suspended solids, charges per pound shall be
made in accordance with the results of calculations as outlined in subsection
(G)3 of this section for the billing period.
Extra strength surcharges determined for the preceding year shall be applied
until a new determination is made of the unit costs for BOD and suspended
solids and of volume and strength of wastes discharged by a user.
In the event that a change in sewage volume or strength is considered to have
taken place, the city will have the right to obtain updated information on
volume and strengths of a user's discharge and to make adjustments in the
number of pounds applicable for surcharge. Should a user desire to have extra
strength surcharges adjusted, arrangements may be worked out with the
superintendent for additional sampling analyses and surcharge computations,
with the user paying for the cost of such additional measurement, analyses and
calculations as determined by the superintendent. (Ord. 1267, 12-5-1989)
   (H)   Outside City Limits: Debt service charges for sewer service outside
city limits shall be two hundred percent (200%) of the debt service portion of
the sewer rate inside city limits. (Ord. 1287, 7-17-1990)
   (I)   Annual Review: Following each annual audit of the fiscal year ending
April 30, the city will review, on the basis of the past year's audit and
volumes and strengths of wastes treated, the sewer rates, including service
charges, volume charges, and extra strength surcharge. Revisions will be made,
if appropriate, to take effect as soon as practicable. (Ord. 1267, 12-5-1989)
   (J)   Water Rate Amendments: In addition to the foregoing charges, the water
rates shall be amended from time to time by city staff with prior council
approval following annual review to reflect the actual cost, including
administrative expenses, of special electrical costs or expenses incurred by
the city in the operation and maintenance of the city water well(s) at not to
exceed twenty cents ($0.20) per one hundred (100) cubic feet of water per well
when in operation. Such actual costs shall be spread evenly and billed to city
water customers in the same manner as the foregoing charges are spread and
billed. Such special or extraordinary costs or expenses shall be immediately
reduced or removed as the actual cost or expense to the city is reduced or
removed, except that if a pump runs for fifty percent (50%) or more of a
billing cycle, the surcharge shall be billed for the entire billing cycle.
(Ord. 1267, 12-5-1989; amd. Ord. 1689, 3-20-2001)
   (K)   Remediation Water:
      1.   Dischargers of remediation water as limited in subsection 8-19-31(M)
of this title shall pay a charge to be called a "remediation water charge" of
three cents ($0.03) per gallon for each gallon of such wastewater delivered
and/or discharged to the City under the provisions of this subsection. Such
charges shall be in lieu of flow, BOD and TSS charges as established herein.
The doubling of wastewater treatment bills for outside sources (not within the
City limits) shall be applicable to the above charges.
      2.   Charges for sampling and analyses undertaken by the City for
inspection shall be borne by the party requesting the discharge. (Ord. 1454, 3-
7-1995)

Stage 1: Voluntary conservation       When water level at Canton Lake reaches 8
                                      feet below Canton Lake Dam overflow

The water superintendent or his designee shall daily measure the water level at
Canton Lake Dam (at or near the water intake structure) and shall daily advise
the mayor or his designee of the water level at Canton Lake.
Water conservation stages shall be automatically implemented by operation of
law as the water level at Canton Lake Dam reaches eight feet (8') below the
level at which water normally overflows the Canton Lake Dam spillway.
Successive conservation stages shall be initiated by operation of law as the
water level at Canton Lake Dam reaches successively lower levels as set forth
in the foregoing chart. (Ord. 1231, 2-21-1989)
8-10.1-11: PRESUMPTION:
For purposes of this chapter, it shall be presumed that a person, corporation,
or association in whose name the water utility of the city is or was last
billed or who is receiving the economic benefit of said water supply has
knowingly made, caused, used or permitted the use of water received from the
city for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, governmental or any
other purpose in a manner contrary to any provision of this chapter, or in an
amount in excess of the use permitted by the conservation stage in effect, or
in a manner contrary to the terms and conditions of a valid variance, permit or
compliance agreement issued by the review board, if the water has been used in
a manner contrary to any provision of this chapter, or in an amount in excess
of the use permitted by the conservation stage in effect or in a manner
contrary to the terms and conditions of a valid variance, permit or compliance
agreement issued by the review board. (Ord. 1231, 2-21-1989)
8-10.1-12: MANDATORY CONSERVATION STAGE IMPLEMENTATION:
The city engineer shall monitor the projected supply and demand for water by
its customers on a daily basis from the date of implementation of this chapter,
and shall recommend to the mayor and city council the extent of the
conservation required through the implementation or termination of particular,
conservation stages in order for the department to prudently plan for and
supply water to its customers. Thereafter, the mayor may order that the
appropriate stage of water conservation be implemented or terminated in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this chapter. Said order shall be
made by public announcement and shall be published a minimum of one time daily
in a newspaper in general circulation and shall become effective immediately
upon such publication. Publication shall continue on a daily basis until such
time as all restrictions are removed. (Ord. 1231, 2-21-1989)
8-10.1-13: REVIEW BOARD; VARIANCES; PERMITS AND COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS:
A review board shall be immediately established by mayoral appointment to
review hardship and special cases which cannot follow the letter of this
chapter. It is the purpose of the review board to review hardship or special
cases and to determine whether or not said case warrants a variance, permit or
compliance agreement. Said board shall consider the facts of each case and
decide whether to grant a variance or a permit or to enter into a compliance
agreement within five (5) working days of the receipt of a properly completed
"application for variance/permit/compliance agreement" form. A variance shall
be granted only for reasons of "economic hardship" which is defined as a threat
to an individual's or business' primary source of income. (But under no
circumstances shall inconvenience or the potential for damage of landscaping be
considered an economic hardship which justifies a variance.) The board shall
authorize only the implementation of equitable water use restrictions which
further the purpose and intent of the emergency water conservation plan. The
special water use restrictions authorized by the board in each special or
hardship case shall be set forth on the face of the variance, permit or
compliance agreement. A fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00) per permit
application for these variances, permits or compliance agreements shall be
assessed to defray administrative costs.
A variance, permit or compliance agreement issued under stage 2 of the
emergency water conservation ordinance shall not be valid upon implementation
of stage 3 or stage 4 of said ordinance. A variance, permit or compliance
agreement expires under its own terms and conditions and/or when another stage
of the emergency water conservation ordinance is in effect. A separate
application for a variance, permit or compliance agreement must be submitted at
each stage of the emergency water conservation plan.
Any person, corporation, or association who is issued a variance, permit or
compliance agreement and makes use of the water utility of the city pursuant to
said variance, permit or compliance agreement shall provide proof of said
variance, permit or compliance agreement upon demand by any peace officer or
person authorized by the city to enforce this chapter. Upon conviction of a
person, corporation or association of violating any provision of this chapter,
the review board may revoke any permit, variance, or compliance agreement
previously granted. However, the board shall notify the applicant of the
proposed revocation five (5) working days before taking such action, and
applicant shall be given the opportunity to be heard by the review board prior
to its taking such action. (Ord. 1231, 2-21-1989)
8-10.1-14: PENALTY:
Any person, corporation, or association violating any provision of this chapter
shall be deemed guilty of an offense and, upon conviction, shall be punished by
a fine not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not to exceed two hundred
dollars ($200.00) for each violation. Each day or portion thereof a violation
continues shall be deemed a separate violation. The violation of each
provision, and each separate violation thereof, shall be deemed a separate
offense, and shall be punished accordingly. However, compliance may be further
sought through injunctive relief in the district court. (Ord. 1231, 2-21-1989)
8-10.1-15: EXCESS WATER USE; BILLING:
Any person, corporation, association, or bulk water purchaser (to include
municipal bulk purchasers) who use water in excess of the reduced monthly
average imposed in stage 3 or in stage 4 of this chapter shall be billed by the
city for such excess water use at triple the normal rate applied to such
person, corporation, association or bulk water purchaser for such excess use.
All other water used in conformity with this chapter shall be billed at the
normal rate(s). All such charges shall be billed as part of the consumer's
regular water bill. Failure to pay such bill when due, to include triple
charges for excess water use, shall result in the imposition of the normal late
payment charge and ultimate termination of water use in conformity with the
applicable provisions of this code. The excess water use billing rates
established by this section are in addition to the penalties provided by
section
8-10.1-14 of this chapter. (Ord. 1231, 2-21-1989)
8-10.1-16: ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS:

shown on the zoning map, divides a lot which was in a separate ownership and of
record at the time of enactment of this chapter, the use authorized thereon and
the other district requirements applying to the least restricted portion of
such lot, under this chapter, shall be considered as extending to the entire
lot, provided that the more restricted portion of such lot is entirely within

parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the centerline or
right of way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as
being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the

equal in width or depth to that required in the residential district.
   (B)   Where the frontage on one side of a street between two (2)
intersecting streets is zoned partly as residential and partly as business or

zoning configuration under this chapter as may be approved by the city council,
and only after proper notice and hearings have been held in accord with this
chapter.
   (E)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official
actions of the city council, the zoning district adjoining such area shall be
automatically extended to the center of such vacation, or in those instances
where less than the entire public way is vacated, the zoning classification
shall be contiguous, and the area included in the vacation shall then

10-13-4: Basis For Approval
10-13-5: Determination Of City Council
10-13-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   (A)   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to provide regulations which
govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval, or denial,
of proposed planned unit developments, and to provide for the possible
relaxation of certain development standards pertaining to other standard zoning
districts.
   (B)   Intent: This district is intended to provide more incentives for
redevelopment in areas of the community which are experiencing a lack of
reinvestment, or which require flexible zoning treatment because of factors
which are specific to the site. This district is designed to promote both the
aesthetic and economic objectives of the city by controlling the site design
and the land use, appearance, density, or intensity of development within the
district in a manner which is consistent with sound land use, urban design, and
economic revitalization principles. They are also intended to provide for
flexible development standards to accommodate unique sites, mixtures of land
uses, or development configurations. In exchange for such flexibility, the
planned unit development (PUD) shall provide a much higher level of site
design, architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional
excellence than normally required for other developments. The application of
these standards will ensure long term progress and broad participation toward
these principles.
PUDs are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only to
PUDs, in addition to the general requirements of this title. A public hearing
process is required to review a request for a PUD. This process shall
essentially combine the process for a zoning map amendment with that required
for a conditional use, with several additional requirements. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-
2005)
10-13-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   (A)   Permitted Location: A PUD may be established for any parcel or tract
of land that has a minimum size of one acre (43,560 square feet). PUDs shall be
permitted with the approval of a PUD zoning district, specific to the approved
PUD, within any one or more standard zoning districts identified in section
10-2-1 of this title.
   (B)   Flexible Development Standards: The following exemptions to the
development standards of the underlying zoning district may be provided with
the approval of a PUD:
      1.   Land Use Requirements: All land uses listed in the districts
established in section
10-2-1 of this title may be permitted within a planned unit development.
      2.   Density And Intensity Requirements: All requirements listed in
chapters 4 through 12 of this title for residential density and nonresidential
intensity may be waived within a planned unit development.
      3.   Bulk Requirements: All requirements listed in chapters 4 through 12
of this title may be waived within a planned unit development.
      4.   Landscaping Requirements: All requirements listed in subsection 10-
15.2-10(B)3 of this title may be waived within a planned unit development.
      5.   Parking And Loading Requirements: All requirements listed in chapter
14 of this title may be waived within a planned unit development. (Ord. 1832,
4-19-2005)
   (C)   Requirements To Depict All Aspects Of Development: Only development
which is explicitly depicted on the required general development plan
(discussed in greater detail later in this chapter) approved by the city
council as part of the approved planned unit development, shall be permitted,
even if such development (including all aspects of land use, density and
intensity, bulk, landscaping, and parking and loading) is otherwise listed as
permitted in chapters 4 through 12 of this title. Requested exemptions from
these standards shall be made explicit by the applicant in the application, and
shall be recommended by the joint planning and zoning commission and approved
explicitly by the city council. If not so requested and approved, such
exemptions shall not be permitted. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-
2014)
The burden of providing evidence and persuasion that any such exceptions are
necessary and desirable shall in every case rest with the applicant. It shall
not be sufficient to base justification for approval upon an already existing
planned unit development. Each planned unit development shall be presented and
judged on its own merits.
   (D)   Initiation Of Request For Approval Of A Planned Unit Development:
Proceedings for approval of a planned unit development shall be initiated by:
      1.   An application of the owner(s) of the subject property; (Ord. 1832,
4-19-2005)
      2.   A recommendation of the joint planning and zoning commission; or
(Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
      3.   By action of the city council. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005)
10-13-3: PROCEDURE:
   (A)   Application Requirements: All applications for proposed planned unit
developments, regardless of the party of their initiation per subsection
10-13-2(D) of this chapter, shall be approved as complete by the zoning
administrator a minimum of two (2) weeks prior to the initiation of this
procedure. The zoning administrator shall forward copies of said complete
application to the office of the city clerk. Said application shall apply to
each of the process steps in subsections (B) through (E) of this section.
   (B)   Staff Review Of Concept Plan: The applicant shall provide the economic
development director and the zoning administrator with a draft PUD concept plan
submittal for a review. The submittal shall contain all of the following items:
      1.   Legal description of the subject property.
      2.   A location map of the subject property and its vicinity at eleven
inches by seventeen inches (11" x 17"), as depicted on a copy of the city of
Canton land use plan.
      3.   A general written description of the proposed planned unit
development including:
         (a)   General project themes and images;
         (b)   The general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses;
         (c)   Approximate residential densities and nonresidential intensities
as described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio and impervious
surface area ratio;
         (d)   The general treatment of natural features;
         (e)   The general relationship to nearby properties and public
streets;
         (f)   The general relationship of the project to the comprehensive
plan;
         (g)   An initial draft list of zoning standards which will not be met
by the proposed PUD and the location(s) in which they apply, and a complete
list of zoning standards which will be more than met by the proposed PUD and
the location(s) in which they apply. The purpose of this listing shall be to
provide the city staff with information necessary to determine the relative
merits of the project in regard to private benefit versus public benefit and in
regard to the mitigation of potential adverse impacts created by design
flexibility.
      4.   A written description of potentially requested exemption from the
requirements of the underlying zoning district, in the following order:
         (a)   Land use exemptions;
         (b)   Density and intensity exemptions;
         (c)   Bulk exemptions;
         (d)   Landscaping exceptions;
         (e)   Parking and loading requirements exceptions.
      5.   A conceptual plan drawing (at 11 inches by 17 inches) of general
land use layout and general location of major public streets and/or private
drives. Applicant may submit copies of a larger version of the plan in addition
to the eleven inch by seventeen inch (11" x 17") reduction. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-
2005)
      6.   At the staff level meeting, the applicant shall engage in an
informal discussion regarding the PUD concept plan submittal. Appropriate
topics for discussion may include any of the information provided in the PUD
concept plan submittal or other items as determined by the joint planning and
zoning commission. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
      7.   Points of discussion and conclusions reached in this stage of the
process shall in no way be binding upon applicant or the city, but should be
considered as an informal, nonbinding basis for proceeding to the next step.
The preferred procedure is for one or more iterations of city staff review of
the concept plan to occur prior to introduction of the formal rezoning petition
which accompanies general development plan (GDP) application. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-
2005)
   (C)   PUD Process Step 1; General Development Plan (GDP): The applicant
shall provide the zoning administrator with a draft GDP plan submittal for a
determination of completeness prior to placing the proposal on the joint
planning and zoning commission agenda for review.
      1.   The submittal shall contain all of the following items, with the
number of copies to be determined by the zoning administrator, prior to its
acceptance by the zoning administrator and placement of the item on a joint
planning and zoning commission agenda for review: (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd.
Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)

planned unit development is proposed, and all other lands within three hundred
feet (300') of the boundaries of the subject property, together with the names
and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the
current records of the register of deeds of Fulton County (as provided by the
city of Canton). Said map shall clearly indicate the current zoning of the
subject property and its environs, and the jurisdiction(s) which maintains that
control. Said map and all its parts and attachments shall be at a scale which
is not less than one inch equals eight hundred feet (1" = 800'). All lot
dimensions of the subject property, a graphic scale, and a north arrow shall be
provided.
         (d)   A general written description of proposed planned unit
development including:
            (1)   General project themes and images;
            (2)   The general mix of dwelling unit types and/or land uses;
            (3)   Approximate residential densities and nonresidential
intensities as described by dwelling units per acre, floor area ratio and
impervious surface area ratio;
            (4)   The general treatment of natural features;

development zoning. This shall identify barriers that the applicant perceives
in the form of requirements of standard zoning districts and opportunities for
community betterment the applicant suggests are available through the proposed
PUD zoning; (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005)
            (8)   A complete list of zoning standards which will not be met by
the proposed PUD and the location(s) in which they apply and a complete list of
zoning standards which will be more than met by the proposed PUD and the
location(s) in which they apply shall be identified to provide the joint
planning and zoning commission with information necessary to determine the
relative merits of the project in regard to private benefit versus public
benefit, and in regard to the mitigation of potential adverse impacts created
by design flexibility; (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
            (9)   A written description of potentially requested exemption from
the requirements of the underlying zoning district, in the following order:
               A.   Land use exemptions;
               B.   Density and intensity exemptions;
               C.   Bulk exemptions;
               D.   Landscaping exceptions;
               E.   Parking and loading requirements exceptions.
         (e)   A general development plan drawing at a minimum scale of one
inch equals one hundred feet (1" = 100') (11 inch by 17 inch reduction shall
also be provided by applicant) of the proposed project showing at least the
following information in sufficient detail to make an evaluation against
criteria for approval:
            (1)   A conceptual plan drawing (at 11 inches by 17 inches) of the

streetlight fixtures and/or poles or street sign faces and/or poles) which are
proposed to vary from city standards or common practices.
         (h)   Written justification for the proposed planned unit development.
(The applicant is advised to use the requirements of the conditional use
procedure to develop said written justification.)
      2.   The process for review and approval of the GDP shall be identical to
that for a zoning amendment as outlined in section
10-17-8, "Amendments", of this title. The approval of a GDP by the city council
shall establish a PUD/GDP overlay district that is depicted as such on the
official zoning map. The previous zoning, however, shall control development
within the area of the GDP until all or portions of the GDP are approved as a
specific implementation plan (SIP) as outlined in subsection (D) of this
section.
      3.   Where a land division or lot consolidation is proposed, a
preliminary plat, final plat or CSM of the entire development area included in
the GDP shall meet all requirements of title 11 of this code, the city's land
division and subdivision regulations.
      4.   For multilot planned unit development districts, a detailed
neighborhood development plan showing the arrangement, design, and uses of
different lots, buildings, driveways, parking areas, parks and open spaces, and
paths.
      5.   All portions of an approved GDP not fully developed within five (5)
years of final city council approval shall expire, unless extended by
resolution of the city council following a public hearing. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-
2005)
   (D)   PUD Process Step 2; Specific Implementation Plan (SIP): After the
effective date of the rezoning to PUD/GDP, the applicant may file an
application for a proposed specific implementation plan with the joint planning
and zoning commission.
      1.   The SIP submittal shall contain all of the following items, prior to
its acceptance by the zoning administrator and placement of the item on a joint
planning and zoning commission agenda for review. The number of copies to be
submitted shall be determined by the zoning administrator. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-
2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)

community betterment the applicant suggests are available through the proposed
PUD zoning. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005)
         (d)   A complete list of zoning standards which will not be met by the
proposed SIP and the location(s) in which they apply and a complete list of
zoning standards which will be more than met by the proposed SIP and the
location(s) in which they apply shall be identified to provide the joint
planning and zoning commission with information necessary to determine the
relative merits of the project in regard to private benefit versus public
benefit, and in regard to the mitigation of potential adverse impacts created
by design flexibility. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
         (e)   Location of recreational/open space areas and facilities,
specifically describing those that are to be reserved or dedicated for public
acquisition and use.
         (f)   A written description which demonstrates the full consistency of
the proposed SIP with the approved GDP. Any and all variations between the
requirements of the applicable PUD/GDP zoning district and the proposed SIP
development shall be identified. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005)
         (g)   The joint planning and zoning commission or city council may
specify other plans, documents or schedules that must be submitted prior to
consideration or approval of the SIP, as such may be relevant to review. (Ord.
1832, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
      2.   The area included in a specific implementation plan may be only a
portion of the area included in a previously approved general development plan.
The proposed SIP shall comply with the requirements outlined in section 10-
15.2-7, "BSO Plan Submittal Requirements", section 10-15.2-10, "Site Design
Standards", and section 10-15.2-11, "Architectural Guidelines", of this title.
      3.   Where a land division or lot consolidation is proposed, a
preliminary plat, final plat or CSM of the entire development area included in
the SIP shall meet all requirements of title 11 of this code, the city's land
division and subdivision regulations. The approval of an SIP shall establish a
PUD/SIP district that is depicted as such on the official zoning map.
      4.   For multilot planned unit development districts, a detailed
neighborhood development plan showing the arrangement, design, and uses of
different lots, buildings, driveways, parking areas, parks and open spaces, and
paths.
      5.   All portions of an approved PUD/SIP not fully developed within two
(2) years of final city council approval shall expire, unless extended by
resolution of the city council following a public hearing.
      6.   The city may require the applicant to provide surety and/or
contractual agreement, with the approval of the city attorney, to ensure the
development of public and private improvements. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005)
   (E)   Consolidated PUD Approval Process: The applicant may file an
application for simultaneous approval of the GDP and SIP with the joint
planning and zoning commission and city council. The consolidated process shall
include all the steps outlined in subsections (A) through (D) of this section,
and decisions shall be made in accordance with section
10-13-4, "Basis For Approval", of this chapter. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd.
Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
10-13-4: BASIS FOR APPROVAL:
The joint planning and zoning commission in making their recommendations and
the city council in making its determination shall give consideration and
satisfy themselves as to the following: (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078,
9-16-2014)
   (A)   That the proposed development is consistent with the spirit and intent
of these regulations and produces significant benefits in terms of improved
environmental design sufficient to justify the application of the "planned unit
development" concept.
   (B)   That the site development plan reflects proper consideration of the
natural features of the site, with particular concern for preservation of open
space and careful grading to ensure proper drainage and conservation of natural
features.
   (C)   That the general character of the development produces an attractive
environment appropriate to the intensity of uses proposed and which is
compatible with existing developments in the surrounding area, and with general
community development plans and policies.
   (D)   That the development can be provided with appropriate municipal
services or their equivalent in private services.
   (E)   That proposed design standards provide adequately for practical
operation and maintenance of circulation, parking, emergency services, delivery
services, and snowplowing.
   (F)   That the proponents of the proposed development have demonstrated that
they intend to start construction within a reasonable period following the
approval of the project and requested overlay of the PUD district, that the
project appears economically sound, that a surety/proof of financing is
provided to the city, and that the development will be carried out according to
a reasonable construction schedule satisfactory to the city.
   (G)   That the proposed development is consistent in all respects to the
spirit and intent of this chapter, is in conformity with the general plans for
community development, would not be contrary to the general welfare and
economic prosperity of the city or of the immediate neighborhood, that the
specific development plans have been prepared with competent professional
advice and guidance, and that the benefits and improved design of the resultant
development justifies the variation from the normal requirements of this
chapter through the application of the PUD district.
   (H)   In the case of proposed residential developments:
      1.   That such development will create an attractive residential
environment of sustained desirability and economic stability, compatible with
the character established for the area by the community comprehensive plan, and
where the economic impact of the development in terms of income levels,
property values, and service demands is at least as beneficial to the community
as that which could be anticipated under the base zoning.
      2.   The population composition of the development will not alter
adversely the impact upon school or other municipal service requirements as
anticipated under the existing basic zoning and comprehensive plan.
      3.   That the total average residential density of the project will be
compatible with the comprehensive plan.
      4.   That the aggregate open space of the development will be no less
than would have resulted from the application of open space requirements of the
previous district.
      5.   That adequate guarantee is provided for permanent retention as "open
space area" of the residual open land area resulting from the application of
these regulations, either by private reservation for the use of the residents
within the development or by dedication to the public.
Ownership, maintenance, and tax liability of private open space reservation
shall be established in a manner acceptable to the municipality and made a part
of the conditions of the plan approval.
   (I)   In the case of proposed PUD planned unit development overlays for
commercial developments:
      1.   That the economic practicality of the proposed development can be
justified on the basis of purchasing potential, competitive relationship and
demonstrated tenant interest.
      2.   That the proposed development will be adequately served by off
street parking and truck service facilities.
      3.   That the locations for entrances and exits have been designed to
prevent unnecessary interference with the safe and efficient movement of
traffic on surrounding streets, and that the development will not create an
effect upon the general traffic pattern of the area incompatible with that
anticipated under the comprehensive plan.
      4.   That the architectural design, landscaping, control of lighting, and
general site development will result in an attractive and harmonious service
area compatible with and not creating an effect upon the property values of the
surrounding neighborhood incompatible with that anticipated under the
comprehensive plan.
   (J)   In the case of mixed use developments:
      1.   That the proposed mixture of uses produces a unified composite which
is compatible within itself and which as a total developmental entity is
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and consistent with the general
objectives of the comprehensive plan.
      2.   That the various types of uses conform to the general requirements
as herein set forth, applicable to projects of such use character. (Ord. 1832,
4-19-2005)
10-13-5: DETERMINATION OF CITY COUNCIL:
   (A)   The city council, after due consideration and recommendation by the
joint planning and zoning commission, may deny the petition, approve the
petition as submitted or approve the petition subject to additional conditions.
A planned unit development may only be approved by an ordinance adopted by the
city council. Any ordinance approving a planned unit development shall specify
the special conditions and restrictions imposed on the planned unit development
and shall include the development plan and plat of subdivision, provided that a
plat or redivision or consolidation may be approved by the city council as part
of the planned unit development and must be recorded before permits may be
issued. Said ordinance shall further contain a legal description of the
property subject to such planned unit development and said ordinance shall be
recorded in the office of the register of deeds of Fulton County before any
permits may be obtained.
   (B)   The approval of a petition and consequent amending of the zoning map
to include the PUD district shall be based on and include as conditions to
comply with the building, site and operational (BSO) plans for the development
as well as all other commitments offered or required with regard to project
value, character or other factor pertinent to assuring that the project will be
developed basically as presented in the official submittal plans as approved by
the city council and shall be mapped and recorded as provided for special uses
under section
10-17-8, "Amendments", of this title. Such plans, however, need not necessarily
be completely detailed at the time of zoning provided they are of sufficient
detail to satisfy the joint planning and zoning commission and city council as
to the general character, scope, and appearance of the proposed development as
outlined in the general development plan.
   (C)   Any subsequent change or addition to the plans or use shall first be
submitted for approval to the city council and if in the opinion of the city
council upon recommendation of the joint planning and zoning commission such
change or addition constitutes a substantial alteration of the original plan, a
public hearing before the city council shall be required and notice thereof
given pursuant to section
10-17-8 of this title. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
   (D)   No permits, as outlined in section
10-17-9 of this title, shall be approved or issued for any use or construction
activity in a planned unit development without final approval of an SIP by
ordinance of the city council. (Ord. 1832, 4-19-2005)

OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
SECTION:
10-14-1: General Parking Regulations
10-14-2: Off Street Parking
10-14-3: Layout And Construction Of Parking And Loading Areas
10-14-4: Off Street Loading Requirements
10-14-1: GENERAL PARKING REGULATIONS:
Off street vehicular parking in conjunction with all land or building uses
shall be provided, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy as
herein prescribed. In all zoning districts, off street parking requirements for
the storage and parking of self-propelled motor vehicles for the use of
occupants, employees and patrons of the building hereafter erected, altered or
extended after the effective date hereof, shall be provided as herein
prescribed. Such space shall be maintained and shall not be encroached upon as
long as said main building or structure remains, unless an equivalent number of
such spaces are provided elsewhere in conformance with this chapter.
   (A)   When units or measurements determining number of required parking
spaces result in requirements of a fractional space, such fractional space
shall be reflected as one parking space.
   (B)   The off street loading space as required in this chapter shall not be
construed as supplying off street parking space.
   (C)   Whenever a use requiring off street parking is increased in floor area
and such use is located in a building existing on or before the effective date
of this title, the minimum number of parking spaces required at the time of the
increase in floor area shall be based on the usable floor area of the entire
building including the addition.
   (D)   Off street parking for other than residential use shall be either on
the same lot or within three hundred feet (300') of the building it is intended
to serve, measured without crossing any major thoroughfare, from the nearest
point of the building to the nearest point of the off street parking facilities
and such off street parking shall be provided either by an off street parking
lot or by a garage. In the case off street parking is provided in a garage, the
maximum height of such garage shall be twenty feet (20') and may occupy the
required side or rear space, but shall not be closer than twenty feet (20')
from a lot line in a residential district. (Ord. 567, 11-1976)
   (E)   Residential off street parking spaces shall consist of dust free
parking strips, driveway, or combination thereof and shall be located on the
premises they are intended to serve, not closer than three feet (3') from any
street lot line. Garages and carports shall conform to the appropriate
regulations of the zoning district in which they are located.
All required parking in R-3, R-4, B-1, B-2, B-3, and I districts and that
required for churches and assembly places shall be paved as follows:
      1.   A one and one-half inch (11/2") bituminous concrete surface on a
four inch (4") base of bituminous aggregate mix; or
      2.   A two inch (2") bituminous concrete surface on an eight inch (8")
base of crushed gravel or crushed stone; or
      3.   A five inch (5") surface of portland cement concrete or structural
equivalent of any of the foregoing as determined by the city engineer.
These specifications are minimum standards; parties anticipating use of parking
lots by heavy vehicles or very high volumes of traffic should use a higher
standard of pavement design. (Ord. 1937, 7-2-2008)
   (F)   For uses not specifically mentioned herein, the requirements for off
street parking facilities for a use which is mentioned, and which use is most
similar as interpreted by the city council after hearing and recommendation of
the joint planning and zoning commission shall apply. (Ord. 567, 11-1976; amd.
Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
   (G)   In case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off street loading
space shall be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed
separately as specified in the preceding subsection, and the off street loading
space for one use shall not be considered as providing the required off street
loading space for any other use.
   (H)   Any area once designed as required off street parking shall not be
changed to any other use unless and until equal facilities are provided
elsewhere.
   (I)   Off street parking existing at the effective date of this title in
connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be
reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building
or prior use.
   (J)   Two (2) or more buildings or uses may collectively provide the
required off street parking in which case the required number of parking spaces
shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the several individual
uses computed separately. Where the required number of parking spaces exceeds
one hundred (100) cars, the requirements may be reduced by ten percent (10%).
   (K)   The required off street parking shall be for occupants, employees,
visitors, and shall be limited in use to motor vehicles. The storage of
merchandise, motor vehicles for sale, or the repair of vehicles is prohibited
in required off street parking areas.
This requirement shall not be interpreted to prohibit the posting of a "for
sale" sign in a personal vehicle which is used regularly by a resident of the
structure for which the parking space is an accessory use. (Ord. 567, 11-1976)
   (L)   In cases of dual functioning of off street parking where operating
hours do not overlap, the joint planning and zoning commission may grant a
variation. Parking spaces already provided to meet off street parking
requirements for theaters, stadiums, auditoriums, and other places of public
assembly, stores, office buildings and industrial establishments located within
five hundred feet (500') of a church, as measured along lines of public access,
and that are not normally used between the hours of six o'clock (6:00) A.M. and
six o'clock (6:00) P.M. on Sundays and are made available for other parking,
may be used to meet not more than seventy five percent (75%) of the off street
parking requirements of a church. There shall be a written agreement between
all parties concerned where this arrangement is permitted. (Ord. 567, 11-1976;
amd. Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
   (M)   Where lighting facilities are provided, they shall be so arranged as
to reflect the light away from the adjacent residential districts or zones.
   (N)   The amount of required off street parking space for new uses or
buildings, additions thereto, and additions to existing buildings as specified
above shall be determined in accordance with the following table, and the space
so required shall be stated in the application for a building permit and shall
be irrevocably reserved for such use and/or shall comply with the initial part
of this section.
   (O)   No certificate of occupancy will be issued upon completion of any
building or repair operations unless and until all off street parking
requirements, shown upon the plans, or made a part of the building permit,
shall be in place and ready for use. (Ord. 567, 11-1976)

Whenever an off street parking lot is a requirement, such lot shall be laid
out, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following regulations:
   (A)   Adequate ingress and egress to the parking lot by means of clearly
limited and defined drive shall be provided for vehicles. All drives and aisles
shall be surfaced in a manner equivalent to that which is hereinafter provided
for parking areas.
   (B)   All spaces shall be laid out in the dimensions of ten feet by twenty
feet (10' x 20') or two hundred (200) square feet of space, exclusive of area
required in subsection (C) of this section.
   (C)   All space shall be provided adequate access by means of maneuvering
lanes.
   (D)   Where the parking lot is contiguous with a residentially zoned
district which has common frontage in the same block with the parking lot,
there shall be established a setback equal to that required for buildings in
the applicable residential zone buffered in accord with chapter 15 of this
title.
   (E)   Where a parking lot lies across the street and opposite a
residentially zoned district wherein the lots front on such street, there shall
be established a setback line ten feet (10') from the front lot line. In lieu
of this setback a buffer strip may be provided (see chapter 15 of this title).
   (F)   Where the parking lot lies across the street and opposite or
contiguous to and in the same block with residentially zoned property which has
only side lot lines on the street, there shall be established a setback line
ten feet (10') from the lot line. In lieu of this setback a buffer may be
provided.
   (G)   Where the parking lot abuts rear property lines of a residentially
zoned district, there shall be established a setback line of ten feet (10')
from the rear property line. In lieu of this setback a buffer may be provided.
   (H)   The land between the setback line and the lot line in a parking lot is
for the purpose of this chapter called a buffer strip.
   (I)   There shall be bumper stops or wheel chocks of concrete or similar
permanent material, provided so as to prevent any vehicle from projecting over
the buffer strip. (Ord. 567, 11-1976)
   (J)   Wherever a buffer strip is not practical or reasonable, a continuous
unpierced masonry wall of specified height and materials may be substituted if
approved by the city council after hearing and recommendation by the joint
planning and zoning commission. (Ord. 567, 11-1976; amd. Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
   (K)   Where buffer strips are not required, bumper stops or wheel chocks
will be provided, so located as to prevent any vehicle from projecting over the
lot line.
   (L)   The parking lot shall be drained to eliminate any standing surface
water.
   (M)   The surface of the parking lot excepting the buffer strips shall have
dust free concrete or asphaltic surfacing.
   (N)   Plans for the layout of the parking lot must be approved by the zoning
administrator. Plans for the layout of the parking lot shall show a total
dimension across two (2) tiers of spaces and one aisle (maneuvering lane) of at
least the following for the various patterns:
      1.   Ninety degree (90°) pattern: Sixty feet (60') for two (2) tiers of
space, including one aisle (maneuvering lane), with the minimum aisle being
twenty feet (20') in width.

setback requirements required hereby may be modified by the joint planning and
zoning commission with respect to the number of feet required for any case when
it appears an undue hardship will arise from the strict enforcement of the
requirements above set forth. (Ord. 567, 11-1976; amd. Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)

   (A)   When the majority (in excess of 50 percent of the street frontage) of
the lots of record in a block front have been built upon at the time of the

corner zoning lot shall be not less than the distance of the front yard depth
requirement for the lot to the rear thereof when said lot to the rear thereof
has frontage along said side street, and in such case no accessory building on
said corner zoning lot shall project toward said side street closer than the
distance of the front yard depth requirement for the lot to the rear thereof;
provided, that this regulation shall not be so interpreted as to reduce the
buildable width of a corner lot to less than thirty two feet (32'), nor to
prohibit the erection of an accessory building where compliance with this
regulation cannot reasonably be had.

available open space of yards, may be used for single-family residential
purposes, provided the lot width and depth and available open space for yards
is not less than sixty six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of that required by

feet (14') in height, may occupy not more than twenty five percent (25%) of a
required rear yard, plus forty percent (40%) of any nonrequired rear yard area;
provided that, in no instance shall the accessory building exceed the ground
floor area of the main building. (Ord. 567, 11-1976)
   (C)   A detached accessory building shall be located only in a rear yard
except for carports or garages which may be located at the rear of row or town
house dwellings, and apartment buildings after review by the joint planning and
zoning commission and subsequent approval on findings that adequate light and
air is assured to the dwelling units. (Ord. 567, 11-1976; amd. Ord. 3041, 12-3-
2013)
   (D)   When an accessory building is located on a corner lot, the side lot

Occupancy of temporary garages, accessory buildings, and basement apartments is
prohibited. (Ord. 567, 11-1976)
10-15-17: BUILDING GRADES:
Any building requiring yard space shall be located at such an elevation that a
sloping grade shall be maintained to cause the flow of surface water to run
away from the walls of the building. A sloping grade shall be maintained and
established from the finished ground level line at the front lot line at the
sidewalk level. However, this shall not prevent the grading of a yard space to
provide sunken or terraced areas, provided proper means are constructed and
maintained to prevent the runoff of surface water from flowing onto the
adjacent properties except as provided by natural drainage courses or drainage
easements.
When a new building is constructed on a vacant lot between two (2) existing
buildings or adjacent to an existing building, the existing established grade
shall be used in determining the ground elevation around the new building. The
yard around the new building and vacant lots to be filled shall be graded as
far as practicable, in such a manner as to meet existing grades and not to
permit runoff surface water to flow into the adjacent properties except as
provided by natural drainage courses or drainage easements. (Ord. 567, 11-1976)
10-15-17-1: DRAINAGE OF WATER:
   (A)   No person, firm, partnership, corporation or other legal entity shall
directly or indirectly cause any water, above or below the surface, to be
released or discharged from property under that entity's control onto property
of another in an amount substantially greater than that which would naturally
flow onto said property or create an obstruction which substantially impedes
the drainage of water from the property of another, and which creates thereon a
structural health hazard or nuisance. In addition no entity shall allow or
permit the same to be done by any agent, employee, tenant, occupant or other
person or other entity connected with the controlled premises.
   (B)   The city engineer shall have the authority to establish rules and
regulations concerning the format and content of the engineering documents to
be submitted to the city in evidence of compliance with this section by the
party changing, altering or causing the discharge of such stormwater. (Ord.
1586, 6-2-1998)

10-15-25: RADIO, TELEVISION, COMMUNICATIONS AND CELL TOWERS:
   (A)   Generally: This section establishes parameters for the siting of
commercial wireless telecommunications facilities. By enacting this section, it
is the city of Canton's intent to:
      1.   Encourage the use of existing monopoles, towers, utility poles and
other structures for the collocation of telecommunications facilities;
      2.   Encourage the location of new monopoles and towers in nonresidential
areas;
      3.   Minimize the number of new monopoles and towers that would otherwise
need to be constructed by encouraging the use of existing structures;
      4.   Encourage the location of monopoles and towers, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community will be minimal;
      5.   Minimize the potential adverse effects associated with the
construction of monopoles and towers through the implementation of stealth
telecommunication facilities; reasonable design, landscaping and construction
practices;
      6.   Ensure public health, safety, welfare, and convenience.
All public broadcast radio, television and other transmitting or relay antenna
towers may be permitted in a B-2, I-1, and I-2 district, provided such has
access upon a major street and do not exceed one hundred eighty feet (180') in
height from ground level to the top of the highest point of the combined
antenna and support structure. Towers exceeding one hundred eighty feet (180')
in height must obtain a variance from the joint planning and zoning commission.
Any commercial tower or monopole located adjacent to a residential property
must have a horizontal separation distance to the nearest point of the property
line at least equal to one-half (1/2) the height of the tower. If the location
will not allow for a tower height setback, the petitioner can submit a
structural analysis by a licensed structural engineer specifying a tower design
that, in the event of overloading due to extreme weather, will result in a
"bent/kinked" tower but one that will not fall to the ground. In this instance,
the required setbacks will be the maximum possible for the specific site
location but in no event less than the minimum setback requirements from the
lot lines as required by the zoning district in which the facility is to be
located.
All facilities must observe the minimum setback requirements from the lot lines
as required by the zoning district the facility is to be located, and a
building permit must be issued prior to the start of construction.
All antenna support structures shall be constructed consistent with standard
engineering practice and shall comply with, or exceed, the manufacturer's
specifications. All such structures may not be loaded beyond the manufacturer's
specifications.
Commercial cellular antennas and related equipment may be mounted on existing
privately owned, noncommercial towers in residential areas for the purpose of
filling in areas of poor communications, without the involvement of the zoning
administrator or the joint planning and zoning commission. It is recommended
that there be a written agreement between the cellular provider(s) and the
tower owner.
   (B)   Exemptions: Ordinary maintenance of existing telecommunications
facilities and support structures, existing and operational as of the effective
date hereof and as defined herein, shall be exempt from zoning and permitting
requirements. In addition, the following facilities are not subject to the
provisions of this section: 1) antennas used by residential households solely
for broadcast radio and television reception; 2) satellite antennas used solely
for residential or household purposes; 3) television and AM/FM radio broadcast
towers and associated facilities; and 4) towers and antennas used for private,
noncommercial hobby and recreational communications and experimentation,
including, but not limited to, operations in the amateur radio service, the
family radio service, and the citizens' radio service.
   (C)   Stealth Telecommunications Facilities: Facility for providing wireless
service that is not readily apparent to the casual observer.
      1.   Stealth telecommunications facilities shall be permitted in all
zoning districts after approval by the zoning administrator in accordance with
the requirements below:
         (a)   Antennas must be enclosed, camouflaged, screened, obscured or
otherwise not readily apparent to a casual observer.
         (b)   The structure utilized to support the antennas must be allowed
within the underlying zoning district. Such structures may include, but are not
limited to, flagpoles, bell towers, clock towers, crosses, monuments,
smokestacks, parapets, and steeples.
         (c)   Setbacks for the supporting structure shall be governed by the
setback requirements of the underlying zoning district.
         (d)   Stealth telecommunications facilities shall be designed to
accommodate the collocation of other antennas whenever economically and
technically feasible or aesthetically appropriate, as determined by the joint
planning and zoning commission or zoning administrator.
   (D)   Aesthetics:
      1.   Lighting And Marking: Telecommunications facilities or support

clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for residential
purposes. Home occupations may not be conducted upon or in any accessory

chapter, and shall be used by the city staff and the joint planning and zoning
commission to evaluate such plans. (Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
   (A)   Site Preparation Requirements:
      1.   Engineering:
         (a)   Grading: Modifications to preexisting landforms, terrain, and
vegetation shall be minimized. Site grading shall reflect the natural contours
of the land and the contours of adjacent properties. Abrupt or unnatural
appearing grading design shall not be permitted. Created slopes shall be no
steeper than three vertical feet for every one horizontal foot (3:1).
         (b)   Retaining Walls: Where a retaining wall is necessary, it shall
be designed to not exceed eight feet (8') in total height, shall be set back
from lot lines, and shall be constructed with stone or masonry. Terracing shall
be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining
walls, particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides. Terraces within
staggered retaining walls shall be at least four feet (4') in width and
landscaped.
         (c)   Drainage: Development shall be planned and constructed so that
all surface drainage meets the standards of applicable city, county, and state
erosion control and stormwater management regulations, and does not adversely
affect neighboring properties. Stormwater management facilities, such as basins
and conveyance routes, shall be located, designed, and landscaped to be an
integral and attractive part of the site, with an emphasis on curvilinear
shapes and natural edge vegetation. (Ord. 1831, 4-19-2005)
      2.   Tree Preservation:
         (a)   The site plan shall be designed to preserve a majority of
existing high quality, mature, healthy, nonplantation trees and woodlands.
"Mature trees" are defined as trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of
over twelve inches (12"), and "woodlands" are defined as nonplantation,
continuous wooded areas where at least fifty percent (50%) of the trees meet
this dbh standard. Such trees and woodlands shall be included in the site plan
submittal under subsection 10-15.2-7(B) of this chapter. The joint planning and
zoning commission may allow for credit against the landscaping requirements in
subsection 10-15.2-10(B)3 of this chapter for preserved mature trees and
woodlands. (Ord. 1831, 4-19-2005; amd. Ord. 3078, 9-16-2014)
         (b)   Trees identified for preservation on the approved site plan
shall be protected during construction with barrier fencing installed near the
drip line. If a tree or woodland designated for preservation is, in fact,
removed or substantially damaged during site clearing, grading, or
construction, the property owner shall replace the removed or damaged tree with
a new tree of similar species or with a species native to Fulton County, and
with a minimum dbh of 2.5 inches.
   (B)   Site Layout/Development Pattern:
      1.   Building Orientation/Placement:
         (a)   Orientation: The proposed building orientation should respect
the orientation of surrounding buildings and the orientation of surrounding
streets. Building facades shall be oriented parallel to the primary abutting
street. Buildings shall be oriented so that entrances are clearly identifiable
and directly accessible from the street and parking areas.
         (b)   Placement: Building and structures shall be sited to ensure that
site circulation promotes contiguous pedestrian and vehicle circulation
patterns and that parking areas provide safe and efficient access to buildings.
         (c)   Surroundings: Buildings shall relate appropriately to
surrounding developments and streets and create a cohesive visual identity and
attractive street scene.
         (d)   Setbacks; Active Walls: Deep building setbacks behind large
expanses of parking areas or vacant land shall be avoided. For multi-tenant
buildings, the "active" wall shall be oriented toward the primary abutting
street. The "active" wall shall be the side of the building containing the
majority of storefronts, customer entrances, and windows.
         (e)   Multiple Building Development Layouts: Linear, "strip
commercial" development patterns shall be avoided. Buildings and development
shall be arranged and grouped so that their orientation complements adjacent,
existing development and frames the corner of an adjacent street intersection,
pedestrian and/or vehicle accessway within the development site; and parking
areas, public spaces, or other site amenities.
         (f)   Traditional Neighborhood Development: This is intended to
promote the development and redevelopment of land through compact, mixed use
neighborhoods where residential, commercial and civic buildings are within
close proximity to each other; with interconnected circulation and open space
systems; and with careful attention to the design, layout, and relationships
between different land uses.
      2.   Site Access, Circulation, And Parking Requirements:
         (a)   Access And Circulation: All developments shall provide safe,
efficient, and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation
patterns within and between buildings, both within the site and to adjacent
sites. All elements of the site design shall accommodate access requirements of
emergency vehicles and services.
         (b)   Primary Entrances: The number and location of vehicle entrances
shall be consistent with the existing or anticipated design of adjacent
streets. The specific location of primary vehicle entrances are subject to the
approval of the Illinois department of transportation, Fulton County highway
department, and/or the city of Canton and will be largely dependent on: the
location of existing or planned median breaks; separation requirements between
the entrance and major intersections; separation requirements between adjacent
entrances (or minor intersections); the need to provide shared access to
adjacent parcels of land; the need to align with previously approved or
constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; and the minimum
number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and
efficiently.
         (c)   Internal Circulation: Internal vehicle circulation patterns
shall provide a clear and direct path to the principal customer entrance of the
primary building, to outlot sites, and to on site and adjacent parking areas.
         (d)   On Site Delivery Circulation And Loading: Developments shall be
required to provide loading and delivery facilities separate from customer
parking and pedestrian areas.
         (e)   Cross Access To Adjacent Properties: To the maximum extent
feasible, connections between development sites shall be provided by providing
access points continuous to the adjacent development. The city may require
access easements to ensure that all development sites and adjacent parcels are
afforded adequate access in perpetuity.
         (f)   Pedestrian/Bicycle Facilities: A system of walkways shall
provide direct access and connections to and between building entrances,
parking lots, and sidewalks and paths in public rights of way or adjacent
properties. Where walkways cross vehicular routes, striping or other
appropriate markings shall be provided to improve visibility and safety.
Convenient bicycle parking lots and facilities shall be provided, such as a
bicycle rack close to the main customer and/or employee entrance.
         (g)   Outdoor Storage Of Materials And Products: Site plan design
shall consider areas to store vehicles, manufactured goods and raw materials to
ensure minimal impact on neighboring uses and the public. Outdoor storage shall
be prohibited in required front, side, and rear yards. Permanent outdoor
storage shall be screened by landscaping or materials compatible with the
building's architecture as outlined in subsection (B)3, "Landscaping And
Screening", of this section.

with chapter 14 of this title.
         (i)   Off Street Parking Layout And Design:
            (1)   Siting Requirements: A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the
off street surface parking spaces provided for all uses contained in the
development's primary building shall be located other than between the front
facade of the primary building and the primary abutting street (e.g., to the
rear or side of the principal building(s)).
            (2)   Layout And Design: The parking field in which the main
activities of parking and travel are conducted shall have a landscape island
with a minimum size of two hundred (200) square feet (10 feet by 20 feet) at
the minimum rate of one island for every ten (10) parking spaces. Landscaping
is addressed in subsection (B)3 of this section.

minimize the expansive appearance of parking lots and provide shaded parking
areas. The primary landscaping materials used in, and at the perimeter of,
parking lots shall be trees, which provide shade or are capable of providing
shade at maturity.
The perimeter of the parking area shall provide for a landscaped area in which
trees and shrubs will be planted to screen parking areas from view and to allow
snow storage capacity. Perimeter plantings shall be at the rate of one tree
and/or grouping of three (3) or more shrubs for every forty (40) linear feet.
         (d)   Building Foundation Landscaping: Building foundations shall be
planted with ornamental plant material, such as ornamental trees, flowering

shall be guaranteed for a period of one year from the date of planting. The
installation of seed or sod shall be required for all yard areas.
         (h)   Service Area Screening: To the maximum extent feasible, areas
for outdoor storage, truck parking, trash collection or compaction, loading, or
other such service areas shall not be visible from abutting streets or
properties. Screening materials shall be the same as, or of equal quality to,
the materials used for the principal building and landscaping.
         (i)   Dumpster Enclosures: Trash enclosures shall include adequate,
accessible and convenient areas for collecting and loading recyclable
materials. Trash enclosures shall be constructed of sturdy, durable, opaque
materials (with trash receptacles screened from view) which are designed to be
compatible with the project architecture, and shall not be located in a street
yard.
         (j)   Mechanical/Utility Screening: Mechanical/utility screening shall
be an integral part of the building structure and architecture and not give the
appearance of being "tacked on" to the exterior surfaces. All mechanical
equipment and utilities shall be screened.

exposed exterior surfaces through the use of the same building materials shall
be required.
   (B)   Building Scale And Facade Treatments:
      1.   Building Scale: Height and scale of new development should be
compatible with that of surrounding development. New development height should
transition from the height of adjacent development to the maximum height of the
proposed structure. Building scale shall be reduced through the proper use of
window patterns, structural bays, roof overhangs, siding, awnings, moldings,
fixtures, and other details.
      2.   Building Facades: Building facades should be articulated by using
color, arrangement or change in materials to emphasize the facade elements. The
planes of the exterior walls may be varied in height, depth or direction.

      3.   Any member who misses three (3) or more consecutive meetings without

   (B)   Powers Of The Joint Planning And Zoning Commission:
      1.   Generally: The joint planning and zoning commission shall have the
general powers provided by 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes section 5/11-12-5 as
said section is amended from time to time.
      2.   Plats Of Subdivision: Plats of subdivision shall be submitted to the
joint planning and zoning commission for preliminary approval. The requirements
and provisions set forth in 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes section 5/11-12-8, as
amended from time to time shall apply to the city's review.
      3.   Hearings; Special Uses: In conformance with the requirements herein
set forth the joint planning and zoning commission shall review, hold public
hearings, and report to the city council its recommendations concerning special
uses. Pursuant to 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes section 5/11-13-1.1 as amended
from time to time, special uses shall be permitted only upon evidence that such
use meets the standards set forth herein. Prior notice of public hearing shall
be given pursuant to 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes sections 5/11-13-6 and 5/11-
13-7 as amended from time to time.
      4.   Annexation: Requests for annexation or annexation and rezoning, as
the case may be, shall be brought before the joint planning and zoning
commission in the manner prescribed by 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes and local
ordinances. The petition for annexation (and rezoning) shall be filed with the
city clerk by the petitioner with clear and legible copies of such petition,
together with all attachments and exhibits thereto appertaining, to be
simultaneously delivered by the petitioner to the city engineer, city attorney,
and the recording secretary of the joint planning and zoning commission. Any
notice by publication required by law shall be given by the city clerk after
the text and format of such notice has been approved in writing by the city
attorney and the chairman of the joint planning and zoning commission. At the
time the petition is filed with the city clerk, the petitioner shall also
submit to the city clerk a minimum of two (2) duplicate original plats of the
territory sought to be annexed (and rezoned). As a minimum, each such plat
shall clearly show on its face the following:
         (a)   The existing corporation line and the proposed new corporation
line.
         (b)   The dimensions of the property as described in the legal
description.
         (c)   A north arrow and scale of the plat.
         (d)   The complete recital of the legal description.
         (e)   Each such plat shall be entitled as an annexation plat and shall
provide a space on its face to show the ordinance number providing for such
annexation and, further, shall provide a space on its face to show the date the
ordinance was passed by the city council.
         (f)   Each such plat shall be certified in writing on its face as
being accurate by either a registered professional engineer or a registered
land surveyor; in either case, the person making such certification shall affix
his seal to the face of each of the plats.
         (g)   The plat as submitted shall then be approved or disapproved by
the city engineer before final action is taken by the joint planning and zoning
commission.
The city engineer is authorized (but not required) to accomplish any plat
required by this section. The city, in all such cases, shall charge and be paid
a reasonable fee by the petitioner for the city engineer's professional
services. Such fee shall be computed by application of an hourly rate
determined by reference to the hourly rate customarily charged by registered
professional engineers in the city for such services multiplied by the hours of
time spent by the city engineer rounded to the nearest one-tenth (1/10) of an
hour. The city engineer may delegate such task to any competent draftsman
employed by the city and, in such case, shall determine the charge by reference
to the hourly rate customarily charged by competent draftsmen in the city for
such services plus ten percent (10%) multiplied by the hours of time spent by
such draftsman rounded to the nearest one-tenth (1/10) of an hour; in all such
cases, the draftsman shall be under the direct supervision and control of the
city engineer. The charges herein provided for must be fully paid before the
plat shall be approved or released by the city engineer.
      5.   Hear And Decide Appeals By Enforcing Officer: Hear and decide
appeals from any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
enforcing officer.
      6.   Hear And Decide Matters By Joint Planning And Zoning Commission:
Hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon which it is required to pass
under this chapter. The joint planning and zoning commission may reverse or
affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify or amend the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed from to the extent and in the manner that
the joint planning and zoning commission may decide to be fitting and proper in
the premises, and to that end the joint planning and zoning commission shall
also have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. When a
property owner shows that a strict application of the terms of this chapter
relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures, or
to the use of land, imposes upon him practical difficulties or particular
hardship, then the joint planning and zoning commission may make such
variations of the strict application of terms of this chapter as are in harmony
with its general purpose and intent when the joint planning and zoning
commission is satisfied, under the evidence heard before it, that a granting of
such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant but is
necessary to alleviate some demonstrable hardship.
However, nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant the joint
planning and zoning commission the power or authority to alter or change the
zoning ordinance or the district map; such power and authority being reserved
for the city council. In order to partially defray the expenses of the public
hearing involving joint planning and zoning commission matters, the applicant
shall pay the sum of thirty five dollars ($35.00) to the city treasurer at the
time of the filing of the appeal.
All final administrative decisions of the joint planning and zoning commission
rendered under the terms of this chapter shall be subject to judicial review
pursuant to the provisions of the administrative review act, approved May 8,
1945, and all amendments and modifications thereof, and the rules adopted
pursuant thereto.
   (C)   Meetings, Notice, Records, And Reports: All meetings of the joint
planning and zoning commission shall be held at the call of the chairman and at
such other times as the commission may determine. All meetings of the joint
planning and zoning commission shall be open to the public. The chairman, or in
his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths or compel the attendance
of witnesses. No hearing shall be conducted without a quorum of the joint
planning and zoning commission being present, which shall consist of eight (8)
members. The concurring vote of eight (8) members shall be necessary to decide
or make recommendations in favor of an appellant or applicant in any matter
upon which the board is required to pass. The board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon every question, or if absent
or failing to vote, indicating that fact, and shall also keep records of its
hearings, examinations, and other official actions. A transcript of testimony
presented at all public hearings on all matters heard by the joint planning and
zoning commission shall be included in the joint planning and zoning commission
report. Any absent member who certifies that he has read the transcript of the
proceedings before the joint planning and zoning commission may vote upon any
question before the joint planning and zoning commission.
If, due to absence, a favorable recommendation or decision has not been either
made by four (4) or more favorable votes or precluded by eight (8) or more
unfavorable votes, additional members shall read the transcript and vote until
there are eight (8) concurring votes. Findings of fact shall be made for each
appeal or application for a time extension, or variation, specifying the
reasons for granting or denying, or recommending the granting or denying of,
such appeal or application. The terms of the relief granted or recommended
shall be specifically set forth in a conclusion or statement separate from the
findings of fact.
Every rule or regulation, and every order, requirement, decision or
determination of the joint planning and zoning commission shall be filed
promptly with the secretary of the joint planning and zoning commission and
shall be a public record. The joint planning and zoning commission shall adopt
its own rules of procedure not in conflict with the statutes.
Notice shall be given of the time and place of every public hearing not more
than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, by
publishing a notice thereof at least once in one or more newspapers published
in or having a general circulation within the city. At the hearing, any party
may appear in person, or by agent or by attorney.
Applicants for zoning variations shall have the following rights, in addition
to any others they may possess by law, at any hearing before the joint planning
and zoning commission:
      1.   To have subpoenas issued for persons to appear at hearings and for
examination of documents by the person requesting the subpoenas either before
or at the hearing, subject to the limitations contained herein. The board shall
issue subpoenas as requested by the applicants and eligible property owners.
Subpoenas shall only be enforceable against persons or for documents which have
substantial evidentiary connection with:
         (a)   The subject property, and
         (b)   Facts which would support or negate the requisite legal
standards for granting the application or appeal. All matters relating to
subpoenas concerning a particular case, including all enforcement and motions
to quash, shall be heard in a single action. Service of such subpoenas shall be
made in the same manner as summons in a civil action.
      2.   To cross examine all witnesses testifying; and
      3.   To present witnesses on their behalf.
Eligible property owners, as set forth above, who wish to object shall, upon
request, be granted one continuance for the purpose of presenting evidence to
rebut testimony given by the applicant. The date of such continued hearings
shall be within the discretion of the joint planning and zoning commission.
   (D)   Final Actions Of The Joint Planning And Zoning Commission:
      1.   Actions by the joint planning and zoning commission from rulings of
enforcing officers, appeals for a time extension, and applications for
variations from the provisions of this chapter, shall constitute a final
action.
      2.   The findings of the joint planning and zoning commission from
rulings of enforcing officers, appeals for time extensions, and applications
for variations, shall be in writing and shall be arrived at in each specific
case after a public hearing. A report of said findings, with the terms of
relief granted specifically set forth in a conclusion or separate statement,
shall be transmitted to the appellant or applicant, with copies to the city
council, within a reasonable time.
      3.   A variation approved by the joint planning and zoning commission
shall not be valid after a period of one year, unless during this period such
variation shall be established or unless any required building, development or
erection permit for an approved variation is obtained within this period, after
which construction shall proceed to completion within a reasonable time. Said
one year period may be extended in writing for good cause by the joint planning
and zoning commission for up to an additional one year, if no other zoning
changes affecting the property have been made or are formally pending before
the council or said period may be extended by the joint planning and zoning
commission for such time as it shall determine, for good cause shown. (Ord.
3041, 12-3-2013)
10-17-4: APPEALS:
   (A)   Authority: The joint planning and zoning commission shall hear and
decide appeals from an administrative order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the zoning administrator.
   (B)   Initiation:
      1.   An appeal to the joint planning and zoning commission may be made by
any person aggrieved or by any officer or department of the municipality. The
appeal shall be taken within forty five (45) days of the action complained of,
by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the joint
planning and zoning commission a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds
thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to
the joint planning and zoning commission all the papers constituting the record
upon which the appeal action is taken.
      2.   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to
the joint planning and zoning commission after the notice of appeal has been
filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would,
in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In this event the
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by an order of the joint planning
and zoning commission or a court of record on application of and on notice to
the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause being shown.
   (C)   Processing:
      1.   An appeal shall be filed with the city clerk. The city clerk shall
forward the appeal to the joint planning and zoning commission for processing
in accordance with the Illinois statutes.
      2.   The joint planning and zoning commission shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of the appeal and give due notice thereof to parties and shall
decide the appeal within reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person, or by agent, or by attorney. The joint planning and zoning
commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination, as in its opinion ought to be made in
the premises and to that end has all the powers of the official from whom the
appeal is taken. (Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
10-17-5: VARIATIONS:
   (A)   Authority: The joint planning and zoning commission shall rule on
requested variances in the approved zoning ordinance only after proper notice
and public hearing on the request. The notice of hearing shall contain the
address and location of the property for which the variation is sought along
with a brief discussion of the nature of the request. After appropriate
requests and proper notice as shall be required by the Illinois statutes, the
joint planning and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing upon all
applications for variations and shall grant or deny a variation only where it
shall have been made a finding of fact specifying the reason or reasons
therefor. Such findings shall be based upon the standards set forth in
subsection (D) of this section. No variation shall be granted by the joint
planning and zoning commission without such findings of fact.
   (B)   Initiation: An application for a variation may be made by a
governmental office or department, or by any person, firm or corporation having
a freehold interest, a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a
contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, or any exclusive
possessory interest applicable to the land or land and improvements described
in the application for a variation.
   (C)   Processing: An application for a variation shall be filed with the
city clerk who shall forward one copy of such application to the joint planning
and zoning commission for processing and one copy to the city council for
informational purposes.
   (D)   Standards:
      1.   The joint planning and zoning commission shall not recommend a
variation of the provisions of this chapter as authorized in this chapter
unless it shall have made findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to
it on the following specific issues that:
         (a)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located.
         (b)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances affecting
the tract in question and not a problem which is personal in nature to the
owner.
         (c)   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
      2.   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the joint
planning and zoning commission, in making the determination whether there are
practical difficulties, hardships, or unique circumstances, shall also take
into consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable to the
applicant, have been established by the evidence that:
         (a)   The particular surroundings shape, or topographical conditions
of the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship upon the
owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the
regulation were to be carried out.
         (b)   The condition upon which the petition for variation is based
would not be applicable generally to the other property within the same zoning
classification.
         (c)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
         (d)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
         (e)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property.
         (f)   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property.
      3.   The joint planning and zoning commission may require such conditions
and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary
to comply with the standards set forth in this chapter to reduce or minimize
the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood,
and to implement the general purpose and intent of this chapter.
   (E)   Unauthorized Variations: The variation procedure shall in no case be
used to accomplish a result which could otherwise be achieved by a rezoning of
the property involved, such as, but not limited to, establishment or expansion
of a use not permitted in a residential district; authorizing the construction
of residences in other than residential districts; nor authorizing other than
single-family detached residences in the R-1 and R-2 districts. (Ord. 3041, 12-
3-2013)
10-17-6: RESERVED:
(Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
10-17-7: SPECIAL USES:
   (A)   Purposes: This chapter is based upon the division of the city into
districts, within any one of which the use of land and buildings, and the bulk
and location of buildings or structures as related to the land are essentially
uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are buildings and uses which,
because of their unique characteristics cannot be properly classified in any
particular district without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those
buildings and uses upon neighboring property or consideration of the public
need for the particular buildings or uses at the proposed location. Such
special uses fall into the following categories:
      1.   Buildings and uses entirely private in character but of such a
nature that their construction and operation may give rise to unique problems
with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities;
      2.   Uses traditionally affected with a public interest or uses operated
by a publicly regulated utility; and
      3.   Planned unit developments.
   (B)   Application: Applications for special use permits shall be filed with
the zoning administrator and processed in the same manner as that required for
amendments and discussed in section
10-17-8 of this chapter, and shall be of such form, accompanied by such
information as shall be established from time to time by the planning
commission.
   (C)   Standards: The joint planning and zoning commission shall not
recommend a special use unless it is deemed necessary of the public interest or
convenience at the location or, if private in character;
      1.   It is so designated, located, and proposed to be operated that the
public health, safety and welfare will be protected; and
      2.   It will not cause appreciable injury to the value of other property
in the neighborhood in which it is located; and
      3.   It will not subvert or defeat the primary purpose of the zoning
ordinance, or of the zoning district or area for which it is proposed, when its
effect is considered in conjunction with the cumulative effort of the number of
various special uses of all types already located in the adjacent area and in
the city as a whole; and
      4.   It is one of the special uses listed in chapters 3 through 13 of
this title. In the event the special use is a planned development, the
provisions of chapter 13 of this title shall also be applied.
   (D)   Conditions: The joint planning and zoning commission may recommend,
and the city council may provide, such conditions and restrictions upon the
construction, location, and operation, of a special use, including, but not
limited to, provisions for off street parking and loading, signs, and accessory
uses, as may be deemed necessary to promote the general objectives of this
chapter and to minimize injury to the value of property in the neighborhood.
(Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
10-17-8: AMENDMENTS:
   (A)   Authority: This chapter may be amended from time to time by ordinance

findings and recommendations has been submitted to the city council.
   (B)   Initiation Of Amendment: Amendments may be proposed by the city
council, joint planning and zoning commission or by the petition of any person,
firm or corporation having a freehold interest, a possessory interest entitled
to exclusive possession, a contractual interest which may become a freehold
interest or any exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable
on the land which is described in the proposal for an amendment.
   (C)   Processing:
      1.   A proposal or petition for an amendment shall be filed with the city
clerk and thereafter entered into the records of the first meeting thereafter
of the city council.
      2.   A copy of such proposal or petition shall be forwarded by the city
clerk to the joint planning and zoning commission with a request to hold a
public hearing and submit to the city council a report of its findings and
recommendations. Such public hearings shall be held upon notice by the joint
planning and zoning commission.
   (D)   Decisions: The city council, upon request of the joint planning and
zoning commission, and without further public hearing, may vote upon the
adoption of any proposed amendment in accordance with applicable Illinois
statutes, or may refer it back to the joint planning and zoning commission for
further consideration. In case of a written protest against any proposed
amendment of the regulations or districts, signed and acknowledged by the
owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately adjoining or across
an alley therefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage
directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, is filed with the clerk

vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the aldermen or trustees of the municipality then
holding office.

this chapter, nor to vary the terms of this chapter in carrying out his duties
as zoning administrator.

certificate of occupancy stating that the proposed development complies with
the provisions of this chapter.
   (A)   Certificate Of Occupancy: The certificate of occupancy as required for

for making the required application and said mayor shall be authorized to
provide such additional information as may be required by the department of
commerce and community affairs. (Ord. 959, 12-27-1982)

economic advantages and benefits to the City and to property owners in the City
who seek to operate such short-term rentals. In order to fulfil said benefit
and alleviate any potential adverse impacts in the City, the City has
determined that it is reasonable and necessary to regulate short-term rentals
in the interest of public health, safety, and the welfare of the City's
residents.

                   duplex, or other furnished accommodation where no more than
                   five (5) guestrooms are rented to public guests for no more
                   than twenty-nine (29) consecutive days. The City's Joint

                   to be reserved in advance, via any method, including e-
                   commerce. Short-term rentals shall include the rental of a
                   single guestroom and even the rental of the entire

the City Council.
      6.   The City requires a nonrefundable one-hundred-dollar ($100.00)
processing fee to be paid at the time of application for the conditional use
permit. Said processing fee will also apply to all renewal applications.

the Joint Planning and Zoning Commission. An initial form of the application
may be prepared by the City Attorney until same is amended by the Joint
Planning and Zoning Commission.

fire standards;
      6.   The short-term rental has been inspected by the Director of
Commercial Zoning and Planning or his/her designee;
      7.   The operator of the short-term rental provides the City with an
insurance certificate indicating that the Owner, Operator, and the property are
covered by commercial liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence, for bodily injury and property
damage arising from and after the issuance of the conditional use permit;
         a.   The insurance policy shall be issued by an insurer duly
authorized to provide insurance policies within the State of Illinois.

the duration of the conditional use.
      8.   The short-term rental complies with all hotel/motel tax
requirements, including but not limited to all reporting requirements, of the
Illinois Department of Revenue and the City for the operation of a short-term
rental; and
      9.   The short-term rental complies with all other requirements of the
City Municipal Code and applicable State and Federal laws and regulations.

10-20-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year flood.
The base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section
10-20-3 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.

that is principally aboveground, including manufactured homes, prefabricated
buildings and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational
vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days per year.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required
include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations),
schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major roads
and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or electrical
transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals,
petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances).
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate including, but not necessarily
limited to:
   (A)   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building;
   (B)   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
   (C)   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days per year;

facilities, resurfacing roads, or gardening, plowing, and similar practices
that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed or buildings to be constructed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the
pouring of concrete pads).
FEMA: Federal emergency management agency.
FLOOD: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation,
or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
FLOOD FRINGE: That portion of the floodplain outside of the regulatory
floodway.

synonymous. Those lands within the jurisdiction of the city of Canton, the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city of Canton, or that may be annexed
into the city of Canton, that are subject to inundation by the base flood. The
floodplains of the city of Canton are generally identified as such on panel
numbers 210, 220 and 225 of the countywide flood insurance rate map of Fulton
County prepared by the federal emergency management agency and dated February
4, 2011. Floodplain also includes those areas of known flooding as identified
by the community. The floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Fulton
County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city of Canton
or that may be annexed into the city of Canton are generally identified as such
on the flood insurance rate map prepared for Fulton County by the federal
emergency management agency and dated February 4, 2011.
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural or nonstructural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate, property and their contents.

separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
SFHA: See definition of Floodplain And Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other
improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a
substantial improvement, actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building

includes "repetitive loss buildings" (see definition of Repetitive Loss).
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: (A) Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a structure taking place subsequent to the adoption of this
chapter in which the cumulative percentage of improvements:
      1.   Equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
      2.   Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.
   (B)   The term does not include:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
      2.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or the Illinois register of historic places.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the required federal, state, and/or local permits
and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010)

delineated as an "A zone" on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Fulton
County shall be according to the best data available from federal, state or
other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be
financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations.
   (C)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of those parts of
unincorporated Fulton County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction
of the city of Canton, or that may be annexed into the city of Canton, shall be
as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of
Fulton County prepared by the federal emergency management agency and dated

and
   (N)   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010)
10-20-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the public works director and his/her designee. The
public works director and his/her designee shall not issue a development permit
if the proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to

   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the public
works director or his/her designee shall compare the elevation of the site to
the base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by
the base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by
survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has
not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is
not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base
flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current flood
insurance rate map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
The public works director or his/her designee shall maintain documentation of
the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood
insurance rate map identification.
The public works director or his/her designee shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local
permits, approvals or permit not required letters that may be required for this
type of activity. The public works director or his/her designee shall not issue
a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.

(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained.
In addition, the city of Canton shall notify adjacent communities in writing
thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or
relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010)
10-20-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the joint planning and zoning
commission for a variance. The joint planning and zoning commission shall
review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its
recommendation to the city council. The city council may attach such conditions
to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this
chapter. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010; amd. Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained. (Ord. 2018,
11-2-2010)
   (B)   The joint planning and zoning commission shall notify an applicant in
writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protection
standards of section
10-20-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a
building will: (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010; amd. Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
10-20-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
10-20-6 and
10-20-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010)
10-20-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city of Canton or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010)
10-20-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the city attorney may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
city attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city of Canton shall make application to the circuit court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order
as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The city of Canton shall record a notice of violation on the title
of the property.
   (B)   The city attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The city attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of
the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate the
reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve
the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010)
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the joint planning and zoning commission. Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state: (Ord. 2018, 11-
2-2010; amd. Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010)
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the joint planning and
zoning commission shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010; amd. Ord. 3041, 12-3-2013)
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city attorney from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-
2010)
10-20-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city council
to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program including:
ordinance 948, adopted September 21, 1982, and amended by ordinance 983,
adopted July 19, 1983. However, this chapter does not repeal the original
resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does
this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants
or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2018, 11-2-2010)

CHAPTER 9
PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN AND MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
SECTION:
11-9-1: Principles And Requirements
11-9-1: PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS:
In laying out a subdivision, the subdivider shall comply with the following
principles and requirements:
   (A)   General:
      1.   The subdivision layout shall conform to the official major street
plan:
         (a)   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a major
or collector street, so designated on said plan, such part of such public way
shall be platted by the subdivider at the location and of the width indicated
on the plan. Section and quarter section line streets should be considered for
collector streets.
         (b)   Where a proposed park, playground, school site or other public
area shown on the park and playground plan or other part of the master plan is
located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision, such proposed
public ground or park shall be dedicated to the city, park district and board
of education of the county. Where considered desirable by the developer and
appropriate by the platting authority, open spaces constituting a reasonable
proportion of the gross acreage of the subdivision, suitably located and of
adequate size for parks, playgrounds or other recreational purposes for local
or neighborhood use, shall be provided for in the proposed subdivision, and, if
not dedicated to the city, park district, board of education or county, as the
case may be, may be reserved for the common use of all property owners in the
proposed subdivision by covenant or deed restriction.
   (B)   The Street And Block Layout:
      1.   The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and the
entire neighborhood.
         (a)   Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be
continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.
         (b)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions or unless, in the opinion of the platting authority, such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future
development of the adjacent tracts. Dead end streets of reasonable length
(normally not over 500 feet) will be approved where necessary by topography.
         (c)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
         (d)   Wherever there exists adjacent to the tract to be subdivided an
existing township or county roadway, the subdivider shall be responsible for
the construction of said roadway to the subdivision standards for that half of
the roadway abutting the property to be subdivided. In lieu of the above
construction, an escrow in the amount of the construction may be accepted by
the city council.
         (e)   Alleys shall be platted in all business districts. To provide
safe access to residential lots fronting on major streets, alleys shall be
platted in the rear of such lots or service drives in front thereof.
         (f)   Easements for utilities shall be provided in the rear of all
residential lots except where alleys are provided for under subsection (B)1(e)
of this section. Easements for utilities also shall be provided alongside lot
lines where required.
         (g)   Lands abutting major streets shall be platted with the view of
making the lots, if for residential use, desirable for such use by cushioning
the impact of heavy traffic on such trafficways and with the view also of
minimizing interference with traffic on such trafficways as well as the
accident hazard. This may be accomplished in several ways:
            (1)   By platting the lots abutting such trafficways at very
generous depth, with setbacks or front yards at least ten feet (10') greater or
deeper than otherwise required; and providing vehicular access to them by means
of either alleys or service drives in the rear, or frontage access roads next
to the highways, connected therewith at frequent intervals.
            (2)   By not fronting the lots on the highway but on a minor street
paralleling the highway at a distance of a generous lot depth. Private
driveways in this case shall connect with such minor streets.
            (3)   By a collector street platted more or less parallel with a
highway, six hundred (600) to one thousand feet (1,000') distance therefrom,
from which loop streets or dead end streets would extend toward the highway,
the ends of which provide access to the lots abutting the highway to their
rear.
The foregoing, or other methods for accomplishing the purposes in question must
necessarily be done in consideration of the topography and other physical
conditions, the character of existing and contemplated developments and other
pertinent factors that apply in each case.
      2.   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of
lots of appropriate depth.
         (a)   The length of blocks shall be such as, in the opinion of the
platting authority, are appropriate for the locality and the type of
development contemplated, but shall not exceed one thousand five hundred feet
(1,500') where the average size of lots does not exceed two (2) acres in the
area.
         (b)   In any block over nine hundred feet (900') in length, the
platting authority may require that a crosswalk or pedestrianway not less than
ten feet (10') wide be provided near the center and entirely across such block.
         (c)   The number of intersecting streets along major streets shall be
held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, blocks along such trafficways shall
not be less than one thousand two hundred feet (1,200') in length.
   (C)   Minimum Right Of Way Widths Of Streets, Alleys And Easements For
Utilities:
      1.   Major streets shall be no less than one hundred feet (100') with
median and not less than eighty feet (80') where there is to be no median.
      2.   Collector streets shall not be less than sixty feet (60') wide.
      3.   Local streets shall not be less than sixty feet (60') wide in all
residential districts.
      4.   All dead end streets shall terminate in a circular turnaround having
a minimum right of way diameter of one hundred feet (100').
      5.   Alleys shall not be less than twenty feet (20').
      6.   Where easements are required for utilities, they shall be centered
on rear or side lot lines and their widths shall not be less than ten feet
(10') where electric and telephone lines are to be accommodated and ordinarily
not more than twenty feet (20') if, in addition, sewer, water or gas lines are
to be accommodated.
      7.   Easements for open drainage channels shall be thirty feet (30') wide
centered on the channel. Easements for enclosed storm drains shall be no less
than ten feet (10') or five (5) times the diameter of the storm drain.
   (D)   Minimum Pavement Widths:
      1.   Minimum pavement width for local streets shall be thirty feet (30')
between faces of curbs in all residential districts and thirty feet (30')
between faces of curbs on all other local streets and thirty six feet (36')
between faces of curbs on collector streets. The pavement widths for major
streets shall be determined by the city in each case. The pavement of a turning
circle at the end of a dead end street shall have a minimum outside diameter of
eighty feet (80').
   (E)   Street Grades, Curves And Sight Distances:
      1.   The grades of streets shall not exceed the following except where
topography necessitates:
         (a)   Mayor streets: Four percent (4%),
         (b)   Collector streets, local streets, services drives and alleys:
Seven percent (7%),
         (c)   Pedestrianways or crosswalks: Twelve percent (12%).
Unless steps of an acceptable design are to be constructed.
      2.   All changes in street grades in excess of one percent (1%) shall be
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equal to fifteen (15) times
the algebraic difference in the rate of grade for major streets and one-half
(1/2) of this minimum for all other streets.
      3.   The radii of curvature on the center line shall not be less than the
following:
         (a)   Major streets: Four hundred feet (400'),
         (b)   Collector streets: Three hundred feet (300'),
         (c)   Local streets and service drives: One hundred feet (100').
   (F)   Intersections:
      1.   Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least
twenty feet (20') where local streets intersect with other local streets; and
shall be at least twenty five feet (25') at any intersection with a street of
higher classification.
      2.   The above minimum radii shall be increased when the smallest angle
of intersection is less than sixty degrees (60°).
   (G)   Lots:
      1.   The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the
location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of development
contemplated, provided that no residential lot shall contain less than seven
thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet in area.
      2.   Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. (Appreciation
of 2 to 1 shall normally be considered as appropriate.)
      3.   Every lot shall abut on a street.
      4.   Lots for residential purposes shall be at least sixty feet (60')
wide at the building setback line in order to permit compliance with the side
yard requirements of the zoning title 1  and still be adequate for a building
of practicable width.
      5.   Double frontage lots and reversed frontage lots shall not be platted
except as hereinbefore permitted under subsections (G)2 and (G)3 of this
section.
      6.   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right
of way line of the street on which the lot abuts.
      7.   Corner lots for residential use shall be platted at least seventy
five feet (75') wide in order to permit conformance with the setback on the
side street required by the zoning title.
      8.   Residential lots fronting or abutting on major streets shall have a
minimum setback distance or front yard depth of at least ten feet (10') greater
than otherwise required.
   (H)   Utility Location:
      1.   Water, sanitary sewer and storm drains shall be located within the
street right of way. As built plans will be provided to the office of the city
engineer and shall show the dimensioned location of all private sewer and water
taps. (Ord. 726, 7-17-1979)
