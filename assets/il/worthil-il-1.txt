VILLAGE OF WORTH REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT BOARD
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION FOR A TEXT AMENDMENT TO VILLAGE OF THE WORTH
MUNICIPAL CODE TITLE 5, CHAPTER 2 CONCERNING ZONING APPLICATION FEES
 
On June 2, 2025, the Village of Worth Real Estate Development Board (“REDB”)
conducted a public hearing to consider amending Village of Worth Municipal Code
Title 5, Chapter 2 to relocate the zoning application fee schedule outside of
the Village Zoning Code. Notice of the public hearing was published in the
Daily Southtown on May 11, 2025. The Village of Worth (“Applicant”) initiated
the proposed amendment.
 
At the public hearing, the Village Attorney on behalf of the Applicant. The
Applicant explained that the Village of Worth’s (“ Village ”) zoning
application fees are currently located within the Village Zoning Code.
Therefore, every time the Village desires to amend its zoning application fees,
the Village must pay for the publication of a notice of a public hearing and
the REDB must convene a public hearing to adopt the new application fees. The
current procedure to amend zoning application fees is a burden on Village
resources. By relocating the zoning application fees outside of the Village
Zoning Code, the Village can increase its administrative efficiency to amend
such fees.
 
The REDB considered all evidence presented and all other relevant information
before closing the public hearing and discussing the proposed amendment.
 
I.    Findings
 
Based on the evidence presented at the public hearing, the REDB’s discussion,
and all other relevant information, the REDB made the following findings
concerning the proposed text amendment:
 
1)   The proposed amendment is in the public interest. The Village’s zoning
application fees are currently in the Village Zoning Code, which requires any
proposed amendment first be approved by the REDB. The Village must expend its
funds to publish notice of the REDB hearing, and the REDB must convene a public
hearing for the proposed amendment. The current process is inefficient and is a
burden on Village resources. Revising the zoning application fees to be located
outside of the Village Zoning Code will increase Village efficiency and will
decrease administrative burdens.
 
2)   The proposed amendment promotes the public health, safety, and welfare by
allowing the Village to dedicate its funds and resources to services beneficial
for the public rather than dedicating Village resources to REDB hearings for
amendments to the Village’s zoning application fees. Further, relocating the
zoning application fees permits the Village to update such fees more
efficiently to reflect current best practices.
 
 
 
II.   Recommendation
 
Based on the foregoing findings and all evidence entered into the record at the
public hearing held on June 2, 2025, the Real Estate Development Board (7 - 0)
recommends the Village Board approve the proposed amendments to Zoning Code.

VILLAGE OF WORTH REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT BOARD
FINDINGS FOR A SPECIAL USE PERMIT FOR
A FINANCIAL SERVICES OFFICE
LOCATED AT 11403 S. HARLEM AVENUE, WORTH, ILLINOIS
 
On Monday, June 2, 2025, the Village of Worth Real Estate Development Board (“
REDB ”) conducted a public hearing to consider a request for a special use
permit to establish a financial services office on the property located at
11403 S. Harlem Avenue, Worth, Illinois (“ Property ”). The Property is located
in the B1 Restricted Retail Business Zoning District. Notice of the public
hearing was published in the Daily Southtown on May 11, 2025. The special use
permit was proposed by Senan Shaqdeh with the consent of the Property’s owner,
11401-07 S Harlem Ave LLC (collectively, “ Applicant ”).
 
At the public hearing, Senan Shaqdeh spoke on behalf of the Applicant. The
Applicant proposes to open and operate a financial services office in a tenant
space containing 810 square feet. No more than 2 employees will work at the
Property at any one time. The proposed hours of operation are from 9 a.m. to 10
p.m. daily, with peak hours between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. The Property was
previously occupied by a travel agency.
 
REDB members heard testimony concerning the proposed use and questioned the
Applicant about his plans. The REDB considered all evidence presented and all
other relevant information before closing the public hearing and discussing the
proposed special use.
 
I.    Findings
 
Based on the evidence presented at the public hearing, the REDB’s discussion,
and all other relevant information, the REDB makes the following findings
concerning the proposed special use in accordance with Section 5-2-10 of the
Worth Village Code:
 
   a.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
or general welfare.
 
The Applicant proposes to occupy the tenant space with a business that is
consistent with the previous business that occupied the space. The Property was
occupied by a business office (travel agency) for the last +/-4 years. The
Applicant proposes to continue to offer a service use in a location that is
convenient for those living and working in the Village. Harlem Avenue is one of
the Village’s primary commercial thoroughfares.
 
   b.   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor
substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
 
The proposed office will be located in an existing multitenant structure. The
structure is occupied by a variety of other uses, including a restaurant, a
barber, and a beauty salon. The proposed use is low intensity; no more than 2
employees are anticipated to work at the property at any time. Traffic,
parking, and other potential impacts are expected to be minor. Establishing a
viable business office on the Property will increase the Property’s
productivity and attract potential customers to other businesses located in the
Harlem Avenue corridor.
 
   c.   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
 
The proposed business office will occupy what would otherwise be a vacant
tenant space in a multitenant structure. The tenant space was previously
occupied by a travel agency, and office and commercial uses currently occupy
nearby tenant spaces and much of the Harlem Avenue corridor. The proposed use
is consistent with and complimentary to existing uses located in the area.
 
   d.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities
have been or are being provided.
 
The Property’s existing facilities are sufficient to serve the proposed use.
The Property is improved with a mixed-use structure and a parking lot. Vehicles
can access the Property from 114th Street. The Applicant does not propose any
substantive changes to the Property’s exterior.
 
   e.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
 
The Property has frontage on Harlem Avenue. Vehicles seeking to access the
Property will rely primarily on 114th Street, and the proposed office is not
expected to generate extraordinary traffic congestion. The proposed office use
is comparable in intensity to other low intensity offices occupying other
tenant spaces in the area.
 
   f.   The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations
may, in each instance, be modified by the president and village board pursuant
to the recommendations of the real estate development board, or as allowed for
planned developments.
 
The Applicant proposes to comply with all Village requirements applicable to
the Property and the proposed use, other than the Village’s off-street parking
requirement. The findings from the ordinance approving a parking variance for
the proposed use are incorporated by reference into this section.
 
 
 
 
II.   Recommendation
 
Based on the foregoing findings and all evidence entered into the record at the
June 2, 2025 public hearing, the Real Estate Development Board considered a
motion to recommend approval of the special use permit to operate a financial
services office on the Property. The motion carried (7-0).

SUBDIVISION OF THE SOUTH 1435.50 FEET OF THE WEST HALF IN THE NORTHWEST QUARTER
OF SECTION 19, TOWNSHIP 37 NORTH, RANGE 13 EAST OF THE THIRD PRINCIPAL MERIDIAN

Address:   11403 S. Harlem Avenue, Worth, Illinois 60482   
 
Exhibit B
 
Real Estate Development Board’s Findings from June 2, 2025 Meeting
 
A.   Reasonable Return: The Property cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the zoning
regulations. The Property’s parking lot contains insufficient capacity to
accommodate most new tenants. The Zoning Code requires the Property to provide
16 parking spaces to accommodate the existing uses, leaving only 1 parking
space remaining to serve the tenant space at issue. Accordingly, the Village
must approve a parking variance before nearly any tenant could occupy the
Property. The Property also lacks room to construct additional parking spaces.
The cost of retrofitting the Property to comply with the current parking
standards would be significant, if such a retrofit is even feasible.
 
B.   Essential Character: Granting the variance will not alter the essential
character of the surrounding neighborhood. The Property is located on Harlem
Avenue, the Village's primary north-south commercial corridor. Many service
uses and retailers operate in the same area. The proposed office is consistent
with the corridor’s existing service-oriented character. Typically no more than
2 employees work at the store at any time, and the size of the tenant space is
limited – only 810 square feet.
 
C.   Unique Circumstances: The Applicant's plight is attributable to unique
circumstances not present elsewhere in the community. The structure located on
the Property was constructed long ago when different parking and code
requirements applied. The Applicant is simply attempting to occupy an existing
building with an economically viable use. Absent variance approval, the tenant
space would likely remain vacant and unproductive. The limited size of the
proposed retail use distinguish the Applicant's variance request from other
such requests.
 
Exhibit C
Unconditional Agreement and Consent
 
TO:   The Village of Worth, Illinois (“Village”)
 
WHEREAS, 11401-07 S Harlem Ave LLC, an Illinois limited liability company with
offices located at 30 Orland Square Drive in Orland Park, Illinois, and Senan

services office that wishes to occupy the property commonly known as 11403 S.
Harlem Avenue, Worth, Illinois, legally described on Exhibit 1 (“Property”);
and
 
WHEREAS, Ordinance No. 2025 – 26 (“Ordinance”), adopted by Board of Trustees of
the Village on July 15 2025, grants approval of the Zoning Relief, subject to
certain conditions; and
 
WHEREAS, the Applicant desires to evidence to the Village its unconditional
agreement and consent to accept and abide by each of the terms, conditions, and
limitations set forth in the Ordinance.
 
NOW THEREFORE, the Applicant does hereby agree and covenant as follows:
 
1.   The Applicant hereby unconditionally agrees to accept, consent to and
abide by all terms, conditions, restrictions, and provisions of the Ordinance.
 
2.   The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the Village will not be, in any
way, liable for any damages or injuries that may be sustained as a result of
the Village’s review and approval of any plans for the Property, or the
issuance of any permits for the use and development of the Property, and that
the Village’s review and approval of any such plans and issuance of any such
permits does not, and will not, in any way, be deemed to insure the Applicant
against any damage or injury of any kind and at any time.
 
3.   The Applicant acknowledges that the public notices and hearings have been
properly given and held with respect to the adoption of the Ordinance, has
considered the possibility of the revocation provided for in the Ordinance, and
agrees not to challenge any such revocation on the grounds of any procedural
infirmity or any denial of any procedural right, provided that the Village
first provides the Applicant with 30 days advance written notice of the reasons
for revocation and an opportunity to be heard at a regular meeting of the Board
of Trustees of the Village.
 
4.   The Applicant agrees to and does hereby hold harmless and indemnify the
Village, the Village’s elected and appointed officials, officers, employees,
contractors, agents, representatives, volunteers, and attorneys, from any and
all claims that may, at any time, be asserted against any of such parties in
connection with (a) the Village’s review and approval of any plans and issuance
of any permits, (b) the procedures followed in connection with the adoption of
the Ordinance, (c) the development, construction, maintenance, and use of the
Property, and (d) the performance of the Applicant of its obligations under
this Unconditional Agreement and Consent.
 
5.   The Applicant hereby agrees to pay all expenses incurred by the Village in
defending itself with regard to any and all claims, demands, investigations,
and suits related to, associated with, or arising from the Property, the Zoning
Relief, the Ordinance, or this Unconditional Agreement and Consent. These
expenses will include all out of pocket expenses, such as attorneys’ and
experts’ fees, and will also include the reasonable value of any services

limitation, all subsequent owners of the Property, or any portion thereof, and

sustain the validity of the affected privilege or right.
 
7.   This Unconditional Agreement and Consent may not be amended, modified,
released or annulled except upon the express, prior written approval of the
Village of Worth.

for the Applicant’s obligations under this Unconditional Agreement and Consent.

VILLAGE OF WORTH BOARD OF TRUSTEES
FINDINGS FOR AN AMENDMENT TO A SPECIAL USE PERMIT FOR
A RETAIL TOBACCO STORE LOCATED AT
7011 W. 111TH STREET, WORTH, ILLINOIS
 
On July 15, August 6, and August 19, 2025, the Village Board considered a
request for an amendment to a previously-approved special use permit allowing a
retail tobacco store to locate on the property commonly known as 7011 W. 111th
Street, Worth, Illinois (collectively, the “ Property ”). The special use was
proposed by Asem Jaber with the consent of the Property’s Owner, Husama Samara
(collectively, the “ Applicant ”).
 
I.    Findings
 
Based on the evidence presented, the Village Board’s discussion, and all other
relevant information, the Village Board makes the following findings concerning
the proposed special use in accordance with Section 5-2-10 of the Worth Village
Code:
 
   a.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
or general welfare.
 
The Applicant proposes to continue to operate an existing business in much the
same manner as the business has been operated for nearly the last decade. The
Applicant is obligated to comply with all terms of the original special use
ordinance as well as all generally-applicable Village laws and regulations.
 
   b.   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor
substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
 
The continued use of the Property as a retail tobacco facility is complimentary
to other service uses located in the 111th Street corridor. The business has
established a clientele over the last 8 years and the new operator plans to
continue serving those customers and others.
 
   c.   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
 
The surrounding area has seen little recent development. The B1 Zoning District
accommodates a wide variety of business and commercial uses, many of which
would benefit from being located near successful businesses. Promoting the
productive use on the Property may encourage further reinvestment in the
surrounding area.
 
   d.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities
have been or are being provided.
 
The Property’s existing facilities are sufficient to serve the proposed use.
The Property currently has 2 curb cuts – 1 accessing 111th Street, and other
providing access to Worth Avenue. The Applicant plans to preserve 2 vehicle
access points.
 
   e.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
 
The Property has direct access onto both 111th Street and Worth Avenue. This
access arrangement has existed for many years without apparent issue.
 
   f.   The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations
may, in each instance, be modified by the president and village board pursuant
to the recommendations of the real estate development board, or as allowed for
planned developments.
 
The Applicant does not propose to deviate from any village rules or
regulations, other than a previously-approved variance to reduce the number of
required parking spaces on the Property by 1 parking space (See Ordinance No.
2017-48). The Applicant’s amendment proposal has no impact on the proposal’s
compliance with the applicable zoning regulations. The findings from Ordinance
No. 2017-47 are incorporated into this finding by reference.
 
 
 
 
 
 
EXHIBIT C
 
UNCONDITIONAL AGREEMENT AND CONSENT
 
TO:   The Village of Worth, Illinois (“Village”)

approval of an amendment to a special use permit to develop, operate, and
maintain the Property as a retail tobacco store (the “Zoning Relief”); and
 
WHEREAS, Ordinance No. 2025-36, adopted by Board of Trustees of the Village on
August 19, 2025, grants approval of such Zoning Relief, subject to certain
conditions (“Ordinance”); and
 
   WHEREAS, the Applicant desires to evidence to the Village its unconditional
agreement and consent to accept and abide by each of the terms, conditions, and
limitations set forth in the Ordinance.
 
   NOW THEREFORE, the Applicant does hereby agree and covenant as follows:
 
1.   The Applicant hereby unconditionally agrees to accept, consent to and
abide by all terms, conditions, restrictions, and provisions of the Ordinance.
 
2.   The Applicant acknowledges and agrees that the Village will not be, in any
way, liable for any damages or injuries that may be sustained as a result of
the Village’s review and approval of any plans for the Property, or the
issuance of any permits for the use and development of the Property, and that
the Village’s review and approval of any such plans and issuance of any such
permits does not, and will not, in any way, be deemed to insure the Applicant
against any damage or injury of any kind and at any time.
 
3.   The Applicant acknowledges that the public notices and hearings have been
properly given and held with respect to the adoption of the Ordinance, has
considered the possibility of the revocation provided for in the Ordinance, and
agrees not to challenge any such revocation on the grounds of any procedural
infirmity or any denial of any procedural right, provided that the notice to
the Applicant required by Section 5 of the Ordinance is given.
 
4.   The Applicant agrees to and does hereby hold harmless and indemnify the
Village, the Village’s corporate authorities, and all Village elected and
appointed officials, officers, employees, agents, representatives, volunteers,
and attorneys, from any and all claims that may, at any time, be asserted
against any of such parties in connection with (a) the Village’s review and
approval of any plans and issuance of any permits, (b) the procedures followed
in connection with the adoption of the Ordinance, (c) the development,
construction, maintenance, and use of the Property, and (d) the performance of
the Applicant of their obligations under this Unconditional Agreement and
Consent.
 
5.   The Applicant hereby agrees to pay all expenses incurred by the Village in
defending itself with regard to any and all claims, demands, investigations,
and suits related to, associated with, or arising from the Property, the Zoning
Relief, the Ordinance, or this Unconditional Agreement and Consent. These
expenses will include all out of pocket expenses, such as attorneys’ and
experts’ fees, and will also include the reasonable value of any services
rendered by any employee of the Village.
 
6.   The restrictions imposed by this Unconditional Agreement and Consent shall
be restrictions running with the land and shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Applicant and its heirs, successors, assigns, agents,
licensees, lessees, invitees, and representatives, including, without
limitation, all subsequent owners of the Property, or any portion thereof, and
all persons claiming under them to the extent provided in this Unconditional
Agreement and Consent. If any of the privileges or rights created by this
Unconditional Agreement and Consent would otherwise be unlawful or void for
violation of (1) the rule against perpetuities or some analogous statutory
provision, (2) the rule restricting restraints on alienation, or (3) any other
statutory or common law rules imposing time limits, then the affected privilege
or right shall continue only until 21 years after the death of the last
survivor of the now living lawful descendants of the current President of the
United States, or for any shorter period that may be required to sustain the
validity of the affected privilege or right.
 
7.    This Unconditional Agreement and Consent may not be amended, modified,
released or annulled except upon the express, prior written approval of the
Village of Worth.
 
8.   The parties comprising the Applicant are jointly and severally liable for
all obligations and duties imposed upon the Applicant by this Unconditional
Agreement and Consent.

Village of Worth Real Estate Development Board
Findings for a Special Use Permit for
a Truck Dispatch Office Located at
6657 W. 111th Street, Worth, Illinois
 
On Monday, September 8, 2025, the Village of Worth Real Estate Development
Board (“ REDB ”) conducted a public hearing to consider a request for a special
use permit to establish a truck dispatch office on the property located at 6657
W. 111th Street, Worth, Illinois (“ Property ”). The Property is located in the
B1 Restricted Retail Business Zoning District. Notice of the public hearing was
published in the Daily Southtown on August 10, 2025. The special use was
proposed by Mahmoud Alrahahleh with the consent of the Property’s owner, AJMK
Property Management, LLC (collectively, the “ Applicant ”).
 
At the public hearing, the Applicant explained that he proposes to open and
operate a truck dispatch office in vacant tenant space containing 300 square
feet of floor area. The tenant space is currently vacant and has been vacant
for some time. Three employees will work at the office, and the office will be
open daily between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The Applicant does not anticipate
receiving meaningful customer traffic; the office will provide dispatch
services for trucks.
 
REDB members heard testimony concerning the proposed special use and questioned
the Applicant about his plans. The REDB considered all evidence presented and
all other relevant information before closing the public hearing and discussing
the proposed special use.
 
I.    Findings
 
Based on the evidence presented at the public hearing, the REDB’s discussion,
and all other relevant information, the REDB makes the following findings
concerning the proposed special use in accordance with Section 5-2-10 of the
Worth Village Code:
 
   a.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
or general welfare.
 
The Applicant proposes to occupy a vacant tenant space with a business office.
The tenant space is currently vacant and providing no discernable benefit to
the Village or the property owner. Introducing a new tenant into a space that
was previously occupied by a service use will help support the economic climate
on 111th Street, the Village’s primary east-west commercial corridor. The
proposed use is consistent with and complimentary to other service uses located
along 111th Street and will provide valuable services to Worth residents and
those in nearby communities.
 
   b.   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor
substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
 
The proposed use will occupy a single tenant space in a multi-tenant building.
The proposed office use is low intensity; no more than 3 employees will work at
the Property. The proposed office is not expected to have any noticeable impact
on the residential neighborhood to the south. Establishing a viable business
office on the Property will likely attract potential customers to other
businesses located in the 111th Street corridor. The Applicant proposes to
simply occupy an existing tenant space; the Applicant does not propose to
expand the existing structure in any way.
 
   c.   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
 
The proposed office will occupy a vacant tenant space in a multi-tenant
structure. The neighboring properties are occupied by service uses that are
complimentary to the proposed service use. Introducing another service use to
the 111th Street corridor will enhance the business climate by creating another
customer destination in the Village.
 
   d.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities
have been or are being provided.
 
The Property’s existing facilities are sufficient to serve the proposed use.
The Property is improved with a multi-tenant structure and a parking lot.
Vehicles can access the Property from 111th Street and the alley behind the
Property. The Applicant does not propose any substantive changes to the
Property’s exterior.
 
   e.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
 
The Property has frontage on 111th Street. Vehicles seeking to access the
Property will rely primarily on 111th Street or the alley located behind the
Property. The proposed office use is comparable in intensity to other low
intensity offices occupying comparable tenant spaces within the 111th Street
corridor and is not expected to generate extraordinary (or even above average)
traffic congestion.
 
   f.   The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations
may, in each instance, be modified by the president and village board pursuant
to the recommendations of the real estate development board, or as allowed for
planned developments.
 
The Applicant proposes to comply with all Village requirements applicable to
the Property and the proposed use.
 
II.   Recommendation
 
Based on the foregoing findings and all evidence entered into the record at the
September 8, 2025 public hearing, the Real Estate Development Board considered
a motion to recommend approval of the special use permit to establish and
operate a truck dispatch office on the Property. The motion carried 5 – 0.

1-4-4: ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION SYSTEM:
   A.   Purpose: The stated purpose of this chapter is to provide for fair and
efficient enforcement of Village ordinances as may be allowed by law and
directed by ordinance, through an administrative adjudication of violations of
such Village ordinances by an Administrative Hearing Officer and establishing a
schedule of fines, penalties, costs, authority, and procedures for collection
of unpaid fines, penalties, and costs.
   B.   Definitions: For the purposes of this chapter, the following words
shall have the following meanings:
   ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICER. A person appointed or identified by the
Mayor to adjudicate Administrative Hearings, as set forth in this Chapter.
   CODE. Any municipal ordinance, law, rule, regulation or code set forth in
Chapters 1 through 12 of the Village of Worth Code of Ordinances, inclusive,
except:
      a.   Such ordinances for which the potential penalty described therein
includes a period of incarceration; and
      b.   Any offense under the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar offense
that is a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles; and
      c.   Any reportable offense under Section 6-204 of the Illinois Vehicle
Code.
   OWNER.
      a.   the purposes of violation related to real property, "owner" includes
a person to whom the County Collector sent the last ascertainable tax bill;
      b.   For the purposes of a violation related to motor vehicles, the
person to whom the motor vehicle is registered, as provided by the records of
the Secretary of State of Illinois; or
      c.   Any person so described herein may present clear and convincing
evidence to overcome the presumption that such person is the owner of the
property and/or motor vehicle for which the person received a notice of
violation.
   C.   Creation of an Administrative Adjudication System:
      1.   Pursuant to Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/1-2.1-1, et seq.,
which authorizes non-home rule municipalities to implement a system of
administrative adjudication, there is hereby created a system of administrative
adjudication of violations of the Village of Worth Code of Ordinances. The
system will authorize a hearing officer to conduct adjudicatory hearings of
cases instituted by Village representatives.
      2.   The Village adopts sections of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS
5/1-2.1-1, et seq., as it may be amended from time to time. In the event a
conflict between said statutes and this chapter exists, this chapter shall
prevail.
      3.   The creation and operation of a system of administrative
adjudication does not preclude the Village from using other lawful methods to
enforce the provisions of the Village of Worth Code of Ordinances. Furthermore,
the election to enforce any citation through this system of administrative
adjudication will not represent an election with respect to any other citation,
even if it is for a violation for the same section of the Village of Worth Code
of Ordinances.

by this chapter include violations of the Village of Worth Code of Ordinances

be responsible for maintaining the records of the system, developing forms,
preparing notices, scheduling hearings, recording hearings, providing hearing
dispositions to participants, preparing liens, enforcing judgments, and any
other necessary duties to ensure the efficient operation of administrative
hearings. The Mayor may also appoint such other persons to assist the Hearing
Administrator.
   F.   Powers and Duties of the Administrative Hearing Officer: The
Administrative Hearing Officer shall preside over all adjudicatory hearings and

         d.   In no event shall the Administrative Hearing Officer have
authority to impose a fine in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) per

proper lawsuit against the Village of Worth.
   K.   Failure to appear at Hearing or Violation of Orders.
      1.   In cases where the respondent fails to request an administrative
hearing or pay the fines and penalty by the due date set forth in the notice of

violation in question; and
         b.   Excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a
hearing.

showing of just cause, the respondent shall be provided with an immediate
hearing on the merits for that violation.
      4.   Failure to take action within twenty-one (21) days will result in a
default final determination of liability for the cited violation in the amount
of the fine or penalty indicated. Upon the occurrence of a final determination
of liability and the exhaustion of, or failure to exhaust available
administrative or judicial procedures for review, any unpaid fines or penalty
will constitute a debt due and owing the Village and may be collected by any
means authorized as provided in Subsection M of this Section
1-4-4 .
      5.   Any person, having received notice and an opportunity for a hearing
as provided in this Section
1-4-4 , who knowingly fails to comply with an order issued by the
Administrative Hearing Officer under this subsection, including the issuance of
subpoena, shall, if the order is not stayed by a court of competent
jurisdiction prior to its effective date, be guilty of contempt. Contempt shall

      1.   Any person cited for a violation which qualifies for administrative
adjudication will be provided an opportunity to either:
         a.   Submit payment to the Village in the amount listed on the notice
of violation or,
         b.   Request an appearance at an administrative adjudication hearing
to contest the violation.
      2.   Payment to the Village will serve as proof of satisfaction or
resolution of the violation. All fines and other monies to be paid to the
Village in accordance with this Chapter shall be remitted to the Village and
deposited in the appropriate account as designated by the Mayor.
      3.   In the event a fine or penalty is assessed pursuant to any provision
of this Code, a default in the payment of a fine or penalty or any installment
of a fine or penalty may be collected by means authorized for the collection of
monetary judgments, as noted in Subsection M of this Section
1-4-4 . The Village and its attorney, the finance director, or their designees
may retain attorneys and private collection agents for the purpose of
collecting any default in payment of any fine or penalty imposed by this Code,
or any installment of a fine or penalty. Any fees or costs incurred by the
Village with respect to attorneys or private collection agents retained by the
Village under this action shall be charged to the offender.
      4.   To ensure that code violations are remedied in a timely manner, the
Administrative Hearing Officer, upon issuing a determination of liability that
includes an order of compliance, may order the respondent to obtain a bond to
ensure respondent's timely compliance with the Village of Worth's Code of
Ordinances provision(s) found to have been violated.
         a.   Any bond ordered pursuant to this subsection shall name the
Village as beneficiary and shall be in the amount specified by the
Administrative Hearing Officer, provided that the amount of the bond shall be
reasonably related to the cost of compliance. Any bond issued as a result of
the Administrative Hearing Officer's order is subject to review and
modification by the Village Attorney as to form and amount.
         b.   If the respondent fails to remedy in a timely manner of the code
violation(s) for which a bond has been ordered and issued to the Village
undertakes remediation or otherwise expends funds related to the code violation
(s) for which a bond has been ordered and issued, the Administrative Hearing
Officer, after giving the parties notice and opportunity to be heard, may issue
an order permitting the Village to draw against the bond in an appropriate
amount. The Administrative Hearing Officer shall order the bond amount, less
the reasonable costs incurred by the Village, returned to the respondent upon
proof of compliance with the code provision(s) found to have been violated.
         c.   In the event a respondent ordered to secure a bond seeks judicial
review of the portion of the Administrative Hearing Officer's order requiring a
bond and prevails on that issue, the Village shall release the bond, and if the
Village has drawn against the bond, the Village shall refund to the respondent
the total amount drawn against the bond no later than thirty (30) days of
receive a copy of the reviewing court's mandate.
   M.   Enforcement of Judgement:

without written protest at the time of payment in the event that a locally
imposed and administered tax is declared invalidly enacted or unconstitutional

   E.   It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make available
its books and records for inspection by the village. If the taxpayer fails to

administrator's determination of the best estimate of the taxpayer's tax
liability.
   F.   If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a locally

amount of overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer within sixty (60) days of
the village's determination of the amount of overpayment.
   G.   In the event a tax payment was submitted to the incorrect local

shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted shall not
exceed fourteen (14) days.
   C.   At the hearing the local tax administrator shall preside and shall hear
testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit or
assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings
shall not apply.
   D.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the local tax administrator shall
make a written determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the
hearing. The taxpayer shall be provided with a copy of the written decision.
(Ord. 00-30, 12-19-2000)
1-19-11: INTEREST AND PENALTIES:
In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing, through
audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the time
frame otherwise indicated.
   A.   Interest: The village hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be five
percent (5%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days
and the number of days elapsed.
   B.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 00-30,
12-19-2000)
1-19-12: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing. (Ord. 00-30, 12-19-2000)
1-19-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 00-30, 12-19-2000)
1-19-14: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns
in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and
owing. The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after receiving notice of
the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.
   A.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 00-30, 12-19-2000)
1-19-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 00-30, 12-19-
2000)
1-19-16: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 00-30, 12-19-2000)
1-19-17: LIENS:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord. 00-
30, 12-19-2000)
1-19-18: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be
controlling. (Ord. 00-30, 12-19-2000)

CHAPTER 21
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY
SECTION:
1-21-1: Policy
1-21-2: Definitions And Examples
1-21-3: Reporting Sexual Harassment
1-21-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations
1-21-5: Consequences Of A Violation Of The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-21-1: POLICY:
It is the policy of the Village to prohibit harassment of any person by any
municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or
office on the basis of sex or gender. Sexual harassment is contrary to the
standards of the Village and is unacceptable misconduct which affects
individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. All municipal officials,
municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are
prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment
relationship or lack thereof.
Sexual harassment violates the Village's long-standing policy against
discrimination on the basis of sex. Sexual harassment is also illegal and is
prohibited in the employment context by both Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights
Act of 1964, as amended in 1991, and by the Illinois Human Rights Act. The
Village strives to maintain a work environment free of sexual harassment for
employees because sexual harassment is a very serious matter having far-
reaching effects on the lives and careers of individuals. A claim under this
policy may be brought by the Village or by an employee or member of the
community based on the conduct of any Village employee. Sexual harassment
constitutes misconduct subject to discipline up to and including termination of
employment. (Ord. 2017-41, 12-5-2017; amd. Ord. 2020-17, 6-2-2020)
1-21-2: DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES:
   A.   Definition of Sexual Harassment: For the purposes of determining
whether a particular course of conduct constitutes sexual harassment, and
consistent with both Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended
in 1991, and by the Illinois Human Rights Act, sexual harassment is defined as
follows:
      Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment;
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment. "Working environment" is not limited to a
physical location where an employee is assigned to perform his or her duties,
and can include remote work locations, business trips, professional
conferences, business meetings, and business-related social events.
   B.   Examples of Sexual Harassment: Some examples of conduct that may
constitute sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:
      1.   Unwanted sexual statements - sexual or "dirty" jokes, comments on
physical attributes, spreading rumors about or rating others as to sexual
activity or performance, talking about one's sexual activity in front of
others, and displaying or distributing sexually explicit drawings, pictures
and/or written material. Unwanted sexual statements can be made in person, in
writing, electronically (email, instant messaging, blogs, web pages, etc.), and
otherwise.
      2.   Unwanted personal attention - letters, telephone calls, visits,
pressure for sexual favors, pressure for unnecessary personal interaction,
pressure for dates where a sexual/romantic intent appears evident but remains
unwanted, and stalking.
      3.   Unwanted physical or sexual advances - touching, hugging, kissing,
fondling, touching oneself sexually for others to view, sexual assault,
intercourse, or other sexual activity.
      4.   Textual/Electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
      5.   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      Conduct alleged to be sexual harassment will be evaluated by considering
the totality of the particular circumstances, including the nature, frequency,
intensity, location, context, and duration of the questioned behavior. Although
repeated incidents generally create a stronger claim of sexual harassment, a
serious incident, even if isolated, can be sufficient.
   C.   Definition of Retaliation: For the purposes of determining whether a
particular course of conduct constitutes sexual harassment, and consistent with
both Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991, and by
the Illinois Human Rights Act, Retaliation is defined as follows:
      1.   When an employer takes a materially adverse action because an
individual has engaged, or may engage, in activity in furtherance of state,
federal, or laws.
      2.   The reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion
or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any Village
employee that is taken in retaliation for a Village employee's involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this Policy.
   D.   Examples of Retaliation: Some examples of conduct that may constitute
retaliation include, but are not limited to:
      1.   Reprimand the employee or give a performance evaluation that is
lower than it should be;
      2.   Transfer the employee to a less desirable position;
      3.   Engage in verbal or physical abuse;
      4.   Threaten to make, or actually make reports to authorities (such as
reporting immigration status or contacting the police);
      5.   Increase scrutiny;
      6.   Spread false rumors, treat a family member negatively (for example,
cancel a contract with the person's spouse); or
      7.   Make the person's work more difficult (for example, punishing an
employee for an EEO complaint by purposefully changing his work schedule to
conflict with family responsibilities). (Ord. 2017-41, 12-5-2017; amd. Ord.
2020-17, 6-2-2020)
1-21-3: REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
An employee or individual who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment may complain to the
Village.
   A.   Reporting of Incident: All employees, officers or other persons are
urged to report any suspected sexual harassment by another employee, officer,
volunteer, or other person conducting business with the Village to the
Department Head and the Village Clerk, except where the person is the
individual accused of the harassment. In that case the complaint should be
reported to the Village Clerk's designated alternate. Upon the adoption of this
policy, the name of the designated person shall be posted on all official
bulletin boards of the Village. The report may be made initially either orally
or in writing, but reports made orally must be reduced to writing. For
incidents where a victim feels that an investigation or a complaint will be
reviewed with prejudice by the Village Clerk or his/her designee, the victim
shall report the matter to a detective in the Village of Worth Police
Department, who shall issue a report of his findings to the Village Attorney.
   In addition to the methods of reporting included above, any elected
official, employee, non-employee, or patron may file a sexual harassment
complaint with the attorney for the Village of Worth. This complaint will be
promptly reviewed and investigated privately. A written report will then be
submitted to the Village Board including findings of fact and a determination
of whether the complaint is founded. If the complaint is founded the Village
Board shall determine the appropriate remedy. Pursuant to the protections set
forth in this policy and Illinois law, no retaliation may be taken against any
person who files a complaint. Complaints may also be filed with the Illinois
Human Rights Department, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the United States Department of Justice, and other federal or state
agencies.
   B.   Investigation of Complaint: When a complaint has been reduced to
writing, the Village Clerk or the individual informed above will initiate an
investigation of the suspected sexual harassment within five (5) working days
of the notification. If necessary, the Village representative receiving the
complaint may designate another supervisory or management employee to assist
him/her in the investigation. The investigation will include an interview with
the person(s) who made the initial report, the person(s) towards whom the
suspected harassment was directed, and the individual(s) accused of the
harassment may also be interviewed.
   C.   Report: The person responsible for investigating the complaint shall
prepare a written report within ten (10) working days of his/her notification
of the suspected harassment unless extenuating circumstances prevent him/her
from doing so. The report shall include a finding that sexual harassment
occurred, sexual harassment did not occur, or there is inconclusive evidence as
to whether sexual harassment occurred. A copy of the report will be given to
the person(s) who made the initial report, the person(s) to whom the suspected
harassment was directed, and the individual(s) accused of the harassment.
   D.   Confidentiality of Records: Persons who report incidents of sexual
harassment are encouraged to keep written notes in order to accurately record
the offensive conduct. Every effort shall be made to keep all matters related
to the investigation and various reports confidential. In the event of a
lawsuit, however, the Village advises that records it maintains and the
complainant maintains may be not considered privileged from disclosure.
   E.   Timeframe for Reporting Complaint: The Village encourages a prompt
reporting of complaints so that rapid response and appropriate action may be
takes. However, due to the sensitivity of these problems and because of the
emotional toll such misconduct may have on an individual; no limited timeframe
will be instituted for reporting sexual harassments complaints. Delayed
reporting of complaints will not, in and of itself, preclude the Village from
taking remedial action.
   F.   Appeals: If either party directly involved in a sexual harassment
investigation is dissatisfied with the outcome or resolution, that individual
has the right to appeal the decision. The dissatisfied party should submit his/
her written comments in a timely manner to the Village President.
   G.   External Complaints: Any employee who believes they have been the
subject of harassment or retaliation for complaining about harassment also has
the right to file a charge of civil rights violations with the Illinois
Department of Human Rights and, if substantial evidence to support the charge
is found to exist, to have such an opportunity as provided by law and
applicable regulations to engage in conciliation with the Village and/or to
have the charge heard in a public hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of
the Illinois Human Rights Commission or in a court of law, as provided by
statute. For further information, you may call or write to the Illinois
Department Human Rights, 100 W. Randolph Street, Room 10-100, Chicago, Illinois
60631, (312)814-6269. (Ord. 2017-41, 12-5-2017; amd. Ord. 2020-17, 6-2-2020)
1-21-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No Retaliation: No Village official, employee, or agent shall take any
retaliatory action against a Village employee due to a Village employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report
made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be
protected from retaliation.
   B.   Whistleblower Protection: Similar to the prohibition against
retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5
ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such
as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or
transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the
following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee; or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may
not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   C.   Protection Under The Illinois Human Rights Act: According to the
Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation
for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a
person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good
faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a
charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
   D.   External Complaints of Retaliation to the IDHR or EEOC: An employee who
is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion
after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge - due
within one hundred eighty (180) days (IDHR) or three hundred (300) days (EEOC)
of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. 2017-41, 12-5-2017; amd. Ord. 2020-17, 6-2-
2020)
1-21-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   Discipline: Disciplinary action will be taken against any employee
found to have engaged in sexual harassment of any other person. The extent of
sanctions may depend in part upon the length and conditions of employment of
the particular employee and the nature of the offense. The Village has the
right to apply any sanction or combination of sanctions, up to and including
termination, to deal with unreasonable conduct or discrimination. Where a
hostile work environment has been found to exist, the Village will take all
reasonable steps to eliminate the conduct creating such environment. If an
investigation results in a finding that the complainant falsely accused another
of sexual harassment knowingly or in a malicious manner, the complainant will
be subject to appropriate sanctions, including the possibility of termination.
   B.   Statutory Penalties: In addition to any and all other discipline that
may be applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements,
procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any
person who violates this policy or the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment
contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand
dollars ($5,000) per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the
municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to
local ordinance, State law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a
separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate
and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or
penalties imposed by a court of law or a State or Federal agency.
   C.   For Penalties for Knowingly Making A False Report:
      1.   False Reports: A false report is a report of sexual harassment made
by an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other
than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment.
A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given
the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous
report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any
person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any
provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant
to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee
handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements.
      2.   Statutory Penalties: In addition, any person who intentionally makes
a false report alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and
Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State
Police, a State's Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement
official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) against any person
who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 2017-
41, 12-5-2017; amd. Ord. 2020-17, 6-2-2020)

CHAPTER 4
ADULT USES
SECTION:
3-4-1: Adult Uses
3-4-1: ADULT USES:
   A.   Findings: The president and board of trustees make the following
findings:
      1.   It is uncontested that the village may regulate, through its zoning
power, the location of sexually explicit businesses;
      2.   Zoning, when used to preserve the character of the residential and
commercial areas of the village, is perhaps the most essential function
performed by the village;
      3.   M1 Limited Manufacturing Districts and M2 General Manufacturing
Districts, wherein adult uses would be permitted uses under these regulations,
comprise approximately thirty five percent (35%) of the total land area of the
village zoned for commercial or business uses;
      4.   The village is predominately a single-family residential community
with approximately eighty six percent (86%) of the total land area of the
village zoned and used for residential, school, park, library and governmental
purposes;
      5.   The plan commission held a public hearing, reviewed the experiences
of other municipalities, counties and units of local government relative to
adult uses;
      6.   The proposed regulation of adult uses serves a substantial
governmental interest, while allowing for reasonable alternative avenues of
communication;
      7.   The Illinois Supreme Court has judicially confirmed that the
regulation of adult uses serves a valid governmental interest;
      8.   The proposed regulations are not aimed at the content of adult
entertainment, but at the secondary effects associated with it including, but
not limited to:
         a.   An increase in crime rates, particularly those that are sex-
related;
         b.   A negative impact on the real estate market where adult
entertainment is offered; and
         c.   Urban blight as a result of the decrease in property values.
In attempting to curb these secondary effects, the regulations serve the
village's substantial interest in the health, safety and welfare of the people
of the village; and
      9.   The detailed findings summarized in the U.S. Supreme Court opinion
in City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925
(1986), the Illinois Supreme Court opinion in County of Cook v. Renaissance
Arcade and Bookstore, 122 Ill.2d 123 (1988), and the United States District
Court, Eastern Division of Michigan opinion in S&G News, Inc. v. City of
Southgate, 638 F. Supp. 1060 (E.D. Mich. 1986) aff'd 819 F.2d 1142 (6th Cir.
1987), were before the plan commission when it recommended the adoption of
these regulations.
   B.   Purpose Of Regulations: These regulations are aimed at the secondary
effects of adult uses, and not at the content of the activities performed at
such uses. In addition, these regulations are based on the village's
substantial interest in preventing crime, protecting retail trade, maintaining
property values, and generally to protect and preserve the quality of the
village's neighborhoods, commercial districts, and the quality of urban life.
Furthermore, it is not the purpose of these regulations to deny anyone a
reasonable opportunity to open and operate adult uses within the village. The
predominate purpose of these regulations is the amelioration of socially
adverse secondary effects of adult uses. Finally, the Illinois Supreme Court
has judicially confirmed that the purpose of these regulations as hereinafter
provided serves a valid governmental interest.
   C.   Definitions:

as a temporary measure so as not to be an attractive nuisance to youngsters.
Upon failure of the owner to so close up the premises within the time specified
in the order, the building commissioner may cause the premises to be so closed
through any available public agency or by contract or arrangement by private
persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against the real estate upon

(Ord. 2015-42, 10-6-2015)
   E.   Intent Of Application Fees: The application fees established by this
section are intended to cover the expenses that may be incurred due to initial
staff time required to process such application, and other expenses such as
printing and publication of notices, postage, and other administrative costs.
The applicable application fee is payable at the time of filing of an
application. (Ord. 05-63, 11-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2014-07, 2-4-2014)
   F.   Additional Fees: In addition to the applicable application fee, an
applicant shall also pay the village's consulting and other costs associated in
processing an application. Such costs shall consist of at least the following
items:
      1.   Court reporter;
      2.   Document preparation and review;
      3.   Copy reproduction;
      4.   Document recordation;
      5.   Inspection fees;
      6.   Professional and technical consultant services; and
      7.   Legal review, consultation, and advice.
The village clerk shall invoice the applicant an amount estimated to be
sufficient to cover the village's consulting fees and costs incurred while
processing the application. The applicant shall pay the invoiced amount prior
to the village processing the application. If the village's actual cost of
processing the application exceeds the invoiced amount, the applicant shall
reimburse the village for such excess. If the village discovers while
processing the application that the invoiced amount is insufficient to cover
the village's costs and fees, the village may submit a supplemental invoice to
the applicant and require the applicant to submit a deposit equaling the
invoiced amount before the application is processed further. If the village's
actual cost of processing the application is less than the invoiced amount, the
village will reimburse the applicant the difference. (Ord. 2015-42, 10-6-2015)
   G.   Invoices: The village shall invoice the applicant for expenses in
excess of the application fee already paid at the time of the initial
application. The applicant shall not be invoiced more than once a month. The
village shall notify an applicant when the costs incurred in processing an
application surpass five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), and shall thereafter
notify such applicant when such costs surpass each five hundred dollar
($500.00) increment greater than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). The
village's failure to notify any such applicant shall not relieve such applicant
of the duty to pay all such costs and shall not prevent the village from
assessing and collecting all such costs.
   H.   Personal Service Cost Computation: Payment to all consultants retained
by the village in any capacity connected with the application shall be based on
fixed hourly rate contracts formally authorized by the village board. The
computation of the village's staff time shall be based on salaries of the
village personnel involved plus fifty percent (50%) to cover overhead and
administration.
   I.   Applicant's Payments To Village: At no time shall there be any transfer
of funds from any applicant directly to any consultant or village staff
personnel. All payments to consultants shall be executed only under the
conditions specified in this section, and the applicant shall be invoiced
directly and solely by the village.
   J.   Court Reporter Fee: Prior to any hearing, an applicant must pay a
minimum fee of one hundred twenty five dollars ($125.00) payable to the village
clerk by certified check to secure the services and appearance of a court
reporter. The village clerk shall then procure the services of a court reporter
for the hearing. An applicant shall pay any additional appearance fee required
of the court reporter that is based upon the length of the hearing. An
applicant shall also be responsible for costs of transcribing the hearing if a
transcript is so desired and shall pay the court reporter directly for such
costs.
   K.   Liability For Fees: The owner of the property that is the subject of an
application and the applicant, if different, shall be jointly and severally
liable for the payment of any fees required by this section. By signing an
application, the owner shall be deemed to have agreed to pay such fees and to
consent to the filing and foreclosure of a lien on the subject property to
ensure collection of any such fees, plus the costs of collection, in the event
such fees have not been properly paid as required. Any lien filed pursuant to
this subsection may be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for
mortgages or mechanics' liens.
   L.   Condition Of All Applications, Approvals, And Permits; Time Periods: No
application filed pursuant to this code shall be considered complete unless and
until all fees due pursuant to this section are paid. Every approval granted
and every permit issued pursuant to this code, whether or not expressly so
conditioned, shall be deemed to be conditioned upon payment of the fees
required by this section.
   M.   Nonpayment Of Fees: The failure to fully pay any such fee when due
shall be grounds for refusing to process an application and for denying or
revoking any permit or approval sought or issued with respect to the land or
development to which the unpaid fee relates. When this code provides that the
passage of time without decision or action shall be deemed an approval or a
recommendation for approval, all time periods shall be tolled during any period
of nonpayment, but shall otherwise continue to run.
   N.   Waiver For Specified Public Bodies: The provisions of this section may
be waived by the board of trustees for fees applicable to any application filed
by any public body, or any agency deriving the majority of its revenues from
taxes levied within the village or any charitable organization.
   O.   Special Data Requests: In addition to the data and information required
pursuant to this section, every applicant shall submit such other and
additional data, information, or documentation any village official, officials,
body, or bodies before which its application is pending may deem necessary or
appropriate to a full and proper consideration and disposition of the
particular application.
   P.   Concurrent Applications: When a proposed use or development requires
more than one approval pursuant to this code, applications for all such
approvals may be filed concurrently notwithstanding the fact that approval of
one application may be a precondition to approval of other applications. Such
applications may, in the discretion of the official, officials, body, or bodies
charged with review of such applications be processed together; provided,
however, that no application shall be approved unless all applications that are
a precondition to its approval have first been approved.
   Q.   Withdrawal Of Application: An applicant may withdraw an application at
any time prior to a final decision having been rendered with respect thereto,
provided that the applicant shall have paid all applicable fees pursuant to
this section. Such withdrawal shall be without prejudice to the applicant's
right to refile such application, but any such refiling shall be treated as an
entirely new filing and shall be subject to the procedures and fees of this
code in the same manner as any other new application.
   R.   Copy Of The Village Zoning Map: An applicant requesting a zoning map
shall pay a fee of five dollars ($5.00) for black and white, ten dollars
($10.00) for color. (Ord. 05-63, 11-15-2005; amd. Ord. 2014-07, 2-4-2014)

administrative determinations and shall be subject to judicial review in
accordance with applicable statutes of the state of Illinois. (Ord. 2014-07, 2-
4-2014)

   A.   Authority: The real estate development board shall hear and decide
specific variations as set forth herein to be heard and decided by the real
estate development board and shall hear and submit a report of its findings and

instances where there are practical difficulties or particular hardship in the
way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this title.

development board, of which there shall be a notice of time and place of the
hearing published at least once, not more than thirty (30) nor less than
fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in one or more newspapers with a general
circulation within the village, and other requirements as prescribed by
Illinois statutes.
      3.   Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing, the
applicant, at the applicant's cost, shall cause to be posted upon the real

following words:
THIS PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO A REQUEST WHICH REQUIRES A PUBLIC HEARING. FOR
FURTHER INFORMATION CALL THE VILLAGE CLERK AT (708) 448-1181, OR VISIT
WWW.VILLAGEOFWORTH.COM. THIS NOTICE IS POSTED PURSUANT TO VILLAGE ORDINANCE.
         a.   The sign shall be placed in a location calculated to be seen by
the largest number of persons possible. The building commissioner shall have
sole discretion with regard to such location, and the fact that such notice was
not seen by any particular individual shall not be the basis for reversing any
decision of the real estate development board with regard to any action taken
at the public hearing.
         b.   The sign shall be of such a size and color and with letters of
sufficient size as to be clearly legible from adjacent public rights of way.
   D.   Decisions:
      1.   All final administrative decisions and findings of the real estate
development board on variations to be decided by the real estate development
board arrived at after the hearings shall be final and subject to judicial
review only in accordance with applicable statutes of the state of Illinois.
      2.   The president and board of trustees may decide in accordance with
applicable statutes of the state of Illinois other variations of the provisions
of this title in harmony with its general purpose and intent but shall vary
them only in specific instances where the real estate development board shall
find and report such findings and recommendations based upon standards set
forth herein and that there are practical difficulties or particular hardship
in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of this title
resulting in unreasonable confiscation of property, provided that a land use
variation shall not be granted.
   E.   Standards:
      1.   The real estate development board shall not decide or recommend
variations in the provisions of this title, unless it shall have made findings
based upon the evidence presented to it in the following cases:
         a.   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located; and that the variation, if
granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality; or
         b.   That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and
that the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the
locality.
      2.   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the real
estate development board, in making its decision or recommendations whenever
there are practical difficulties or particular hardship, shall also take into
consideration the extent to which the following facts favorable to the
applicant, have been established by the evidence that:
         a.   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship
upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter
of the regulations were to be carried out;
         b.   The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification;
         c.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         d.   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property;
         e.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; or
         f.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
      3.   The real estate development board may require or recommend such
conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may
be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this chapter to reduce
or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the
neighborhood, and to implement the general purpose and intent of this title.
(Ord. 2014-07, 2-4-2014)
   F.   Variations Granted By Real Estate Development Board: Variations from
the regulations of this title may be granted by the real estate development
board only in accordance with the standards set forth in this chapter, and only
in the following instances and no others:
      1.   To permit a yard less than the yard required by the applicable
regulations;
      2.   To permit the use of a lot not of record on the effective date of
this title for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient
area of the lot, but in no event shall the area of the lot be less than seventy
five percent (75%) of the required lot area;
      3.   To permit parking lots to be illuminated later than thirty (30)
minutes after close of business;
      4.   To permit the same off street parking spaces to qualify as required
spaces for two (2) or more uses, provided that the maximum use of such facility
by each user does not take place during the same hours or on the same days of
the week; and
      5.   To allow any permitted nonresidential use in a residence district to
exceed the floor area ratio imposed by the applicable regulations.
An application that seeks approval of a variance set forth in this subsection F
and any variance(s) not set forth in this subsection F shall only be decided by
the president and board of trustees. The real estate development board shall
hear and submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the president
and board of trustees in accordance with this section before the president and
board of trustees decide any such variance requests. (Ord. 2015-20, 5-19-2015)
   G.   Variations Granted By Building Commissioner: The building commissioner
is authorized to administratively grant variations from the residential lot
size requirements of this code, without notice or hearing, if the variation
would result in a residential lot size of at least ninety percent (90%) of the
size required by ordinance. The building commissioner may only grant such a
variation under the conditions specified in subsection E of this section.
Denial by the building commissioner does not preclude an applicant from
subsequently filing for a variance to be heard by the real estate development
board and/or the village board. (Ord. 2014-07, 2-4-2014)
5-2-9: AMENDMENTS:
   A.   Authority: For the purpose of promoting the public health, safety,
morals, comfort, and general welfare, conserving the value of property

districts created by this title, provided that in all amendatory ordinances
adopted under the authority of this chapter, due allowance shall be made for

building development to the best advantages of the entire village, and the uses
to which property is devoted at the time of the adoption of such amendatory
ordinance.
   B.   Initiation Of Amendment: Amendments may be proposed by the president
and village board, real estate development board, any property owner, or
interested person or organization.
   C.   Processing:

the real estate development board shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time
in conformance with Illinois statutes.
      3.   Notice Of Hearing: Notice of time and place of such hearing shall be

FURTHER INFORMATION CALL THE VILLAGE CLERK AT (708) 448-1181, OR VISIT
WWW.VILLAGEOFWORTH.COM. THIS NOTICE IS POSTED PURSUANT TO VILLAGE ORDINANCE.
 
         b.   The sign shall be placed in a location calculated to be seen by
the largest number of persons possible. The building commissioner shall have
sole discretion with regard to such location, and the fact that such notice was
not seen by any particular individual shall not be the basis for reversing any
decision of the real estate development board with regard to any action taken
at the public hearing.
         c.   The sign shall be of such a size and color and with letters of
sufficient size as to be clearly legible from adjacent public rights of way.
      4.   Findings Of Fact And Recommendation Of The Real Estate Development
Board: Within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing on a proposed
amendment, the real estate development board shall make written findings of
fact and shall submit same together with its recommendations to the president
and village board. Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to
change the zoning classification of particular property, the real estate
development board shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case with respect to the following matters:
         a.   Existing uses of property within the general area of the property
in question.
         b.   The zoning classification of property within the general area of
the property in question.
         c.   The suitability of the property in question to the uses permitted
under the existing zoning classification and that the property for which an
amendment is requested has at least fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet of
area and not less than one hundred (100) linear feet of frontage on a street.
         d.   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question, including changes, if any, which have taken place since
the day the property in question was placed in its present zoning
classification.
   D.   Decisions:
      1.   Action By The Real Estate Development Board:
         a.   The real estate development board shall not recommend the
adoption of a proposed amendment until after it finds that the adoption of such
amendment is in the public interest and is not solely for the interest of the
applicant. The real estate development board may recommend the adoption of an
amendment changing the zoning classification of the property in question to any
higher classification than that requested by the applicant. For the purposes of
this subsection, the R1 single-family residence district shall be considered
the highest classification and the M2 general manufacturing district shall be
considered the lowest classification.
         b.   A concurring vote of a majority of all members of the real estate
development board shall be required to recommend the granting or denying a
request for an amendment.
      2.   Action By The President And Village Board:

finally by the president and village board within six (6) months of the date
upon which such application is received by the president and village board, it
shall be deemed to have been denied.
         c.   In case a written protest against any proposed amendment, signed
and acknowledged by owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to
be altered, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage
immediately adjoining or across the alley therefrom, or by the owners of twenty
percent (20%) of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be altered, is
filed with the village clerk, the amendment cannot be passed except on the
favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all members of the village board. (Ord.
2014-07, 2-4-2014)
5-2-10: SPECIAL USES:
   A.   Purpose: The development and execution of this title is based upon the
division of the village into districts, within which districts the use of land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation
to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there
are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be
properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need for the particular use of the particular location. Such
special uses fall into two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   B.   Initiation: Any person having a freehold interest in land, or a
possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest, and
which is specifically enforceable, may file an application to use such land for
one or more of the special uses provided for in this title in the zoning
district in which the land is located.
   C.   Processing:
      1.   Application For Special Use: An application for a special use shall
be filed with the village clerk on a form prescribed by the president and
village board. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data
recommended by the real estate development board, and shall include a statement
in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed
special use will conform to the standards set forth herein for special uses.
Copies of such application shall be forwarded by the village clerk to the real
estate development board with the request to hold a public hearing.
      2.   Hearing On Application: Upon receipt in proper form of the
application and statement referred to above, the real estate development board
shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed special use. Notice of
time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation within the village, not more than thirty (30) days or less than
fifteen (15) days in advance of such hearing.
      3.   Notice Of Hearing: Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
public hearing, the applicant, at the applicant's cost, shall cause to be
posted upon the real estate, which will be the subject of such a hearing, a
sign bearing the following words:
THIS PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO A REQUEST WHICH REQUIRES A PUBLIC HEARING. FOR
FURTHER INFORMATION CALL THE VILLAGE CLERK AT (708) 448-1181, OR VISIT
WWW.VILLAGEOFWORTH.COM. THIS NOTICE IS POSTED PURSUANT TO VILLAGE ORDINANCE.
         a.   The sign shall be placed in a location calculated to be seen by
the largest number of persons possible. The building commissioner shall have
sole discretion with regard to such location, and the fact that such notice was
not seen by any particular individual shall not be the basis for reversing any
decision of the real estate development board with regard to any action taken
at the public hearing.
         b.   The sign shall be of such a size and color and with letters of
sufficient size as to be clearly legible from adjacent public rights of way.
   D.   Decisions:
      1.   Action By The Real Estate Development Board: No special use permit
shall be recommended by the real estate development board unless there is a
concurring vote of a majority of all members of the real estate development
board, based on findings of fact that:
         a.   The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort, or general welfare.
         b.   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
         c.   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
         d.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
         e.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
         f.   The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the president and village
board pursuant to the recommendations of the real estate development board, or
as allowed for planned developments.
         g.   A planned development also conforms with additional standards and
exceptions hereby established. All special uses permits shall be in effect from
the date of issuance until such time as the original permittee no longer
operates the enterprise which was the subject of the permit. Special use
permits are not transferable to another party. When an enterprise operating
under a special use permit is sold or otherwise transferred to another party,
the new operator must obtain all new permits, including a special use permit,
and all licenses required by ordinance.
            (1)   Use Exceptions: The real estate development board may
recommend and the president and village board may authorize that there be in
part of the area of a planned development, and for the duration of such
development, specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the
district in which said development is located, provided that the real estate
development board shall find that:
               (A)   The uses permitted by such exception are necessary or
desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the
development.
               (B)   The uses permitted by such exception are not of such a
nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding
neighborhood.
               (C)   Not more than twenty percent (20%) of the ground area or
of the gross floor area of such development shall be devoted to the uses
permitted by said exception.
               (D)   In a manufacturing planned development, such additional
uses allowed by exception shall conform with the performance standards of the
district in which the development is located, as set forth in this title.
               (E)   That the use exceptions so allowed are reflected by the
appropriate zoning district symbols and so recorded on the zoning district map.
            (2)   Bulk Regulations: The real estate development board may
recommend, and the president and village board may authorize, exceptions to the
applicable bulk regulations of this title within the boundaries of a planned
development, provided that the real estate development board shall find that:
               (A)   Such exception shall be solely for the purpose of
promoting an integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or
occupants of such development as well as the neighboring property than would be
obtained under the bulk regulations of this title for buildings developed on
separate lots.
               (B)   In part of a residential planned development devoted to
other than single-family dwelling use, the overall floor area ratio does not
exceed the maximum floor area ratio required in the districts where such uses
are permitted.
               (C)   In the part of the planned development containing
residential uses, the minimum lot area per dwelling (and when applicable,
minimum lot width) may be less than required for permitted uses in the
districts in which the planned development is located, provided that there are
permanent open spaces, exclusive of streets and thoroughfares of sufficient
area within the planned development, to at least maintain the minimum lot area
per dwelling required for permitted uses in the district, when applied to the
total area, exclusive of area devoted to streets, thoroughfares, and when
applicable, business uses, of the planned development.
               (D)   Spacing between principal buildings, where a transfer of
ownership of a part of a planned development is contemplated, shall be at least
equivalent to such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly
developed under the terms of this title on separate lots.
               (E)   Along the periphery of such planned developments yards
shall be provided as required by the regulations of the district in which said
development is located.
      2.   Action By The President And Village Board:
         a.   Prior to the granting of any special use, the president and
village board shall stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the
special use as deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and
to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in this
chapter. In all cases in which special uses are granted the president and
village board shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem
necessary as proof of the conditions stipulated in connection therewith are
being and will be complied with.
         b.   The president and village board may grant or deny any application
for a special use permit after receiving the report of findings and
recommendation of the real estate development board, including the stipulations
of additional conditions and guarantees, when they are deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest, except in case of written protest against
any application for a special use signed and acknowledged by the owners of
twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately adjoining or across the alley
from the property proposed for the special use or by owners of twenty percent
(20%) of the frontage directly opposite such property, the president and

400                0.50
 
*Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table.
Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within
the lot boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
            (1)   Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each
source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area –
thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre.
            (2)   From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in the above
item, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of
emission set forth in the table – thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in
pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission.
            (3)   Add together the individual net rates of emission derived in
the above item, to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources of
emission within the boundaries of the lot – such total shall not exceed one
pound per acre of lot area during any one hour.
      6.   In the M2 district the following additional regulations shall apply:
         a.   The emission of more than sixteen (16) smoke units per stack in
any thirty (30) minute period is prohibited, including smoke in excess of
Ringelmann No. 2. However, once during any two (2) hour period, each stack
shall be permitted up to twenty four (24) smoke units (not to exceed Ringelmann
No. 3) in thirty (30) minutes for soot blowing and fire cleaning.
         b.   The rate of particulate matter emission from all sources within
the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of eight (8) pounds per
acre during any one hour, after deducting from the gross hourly emission per
acre the correction factor set forth in the following table:
Allowance For Height Of Emission*
Height Of Emission Correction

400                8.0
 
*Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table.
Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within
the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
            (1)   Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each
source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area,
thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre.
            (2)   From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in the above
item, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of
emission set forth in the table, thereby obtaining the net rate of emission
pounds per acre per hour from each source of emission.
            (3)   Add together the individual net rate of emission derived in
the above item, to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources of
emission within the boundaries of the lot; such total shall not exceed four
pounds per acre of lot area during any one hour.
   E.   Toxic Matter: No activity or operation shall cause, at any time, the
discharge of toxic or noxious matter across lot lines in such concentrations as

CHAPTER 8
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
SECTION:
5-8-1: Purpose
5-8-2: Procedure
5-8-3: General Standards
5-8-1: PURPOSE:
Planned unit developments (PUDs) are intended to allow greater design
flexibility than is permitted by the standard district regulations for tracts
of land where the planned development would better utilize the topographic and
natural character of the site and would produce a more economical and stable
development. It is intended that these regulations will facilitate developments
which are consistent with the spirit and intent of the zoning ordinances, in
conformity with the general character of the village or immediate neighborhood
than development under strict conformity with the applicable district
regulations. Planned unit developments are of such substantially different
character from other special uses that the following standards are established
to guard against use of the planned unit development technique solely as a
means to intensify the use of land, and to provide flexibility that will
encourage sound and imaginative design. (Ord. 96-18, 8-6-1996)
5-8-2: PROCEDURE:
   A.   Application: Development of land as a PUD shall generally require a
dual application. The application shall request a map amendment to change the
underlying zoning to PUD, and request permission to develop the land according
to a particular plan of use. Application procedures and other requirements
shall follow the application procedures for a map amendment. If a governmental
body applies to develop land already zoned as PUD, the application need only
include the particular plan of use and no fees shall be required.
   B.   Improvement Guarantees/Changes In Plan: The provisions of this
subsection apply to PUDs granted to nongovernmental entities. The village may
require that the entity enter into a contract with the village to guarantee the
implementation of the development according to the terms and conditions
established as part of the development plan. Any subsequent change or addition
to an approved plan shall first be submitted for approval to the real estate
development board, and if the real estate development board finds that the
change or addition is not substantial, it may recommend its approval to the
president and board of trustees without a new public hearing. If the real
estate development board finds that the change or addition is substantial, it
shall order a public hearing to be held according to the usual notice and
publication requirements.
   C.   Changes In Plans/Governmental PUDs: Applications for changes or
additions to governmental PUDs shall be made to the president and board of
trustees. Changes or additions to a governmental PUD shall not require action
by the real estate development board or public hearings, unless the president
and board of trustees find that the change or addition dramatically alters the
essential character of the PUD as originally granted. In such cases, the
procedures in subsection B of this section shall apply.
   D.   Zoning Map: Approved PUDs shall be delineated and designated by number
on the village zoning map. (Ord. 96-18, 8-6-1996)
5-8-3: GENERAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Conformity With Comprehensive Plan: All plans, designs, or proposals
for a PUD should be in general conformity with any comprehensive plan approved
by the village.
   B.   Use Exceptions: Uses permitted by exception shall be necessary or
desirable and appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the
development, and not of such a nature, or so located, as to be detrimental to
the surrounding neighborhood.
   C.   Bulk Exceptions: Exceptions in the bulk regulations of the prevailing
district shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an integrated site plan
no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of the development and
surrounding neighborhood, than the bulk regulations that would be otherwise
applicable.
   D.   Development Plan And Specifications: The design features and standards
of PUDs shall conform to a development plan approved by ordinance. The
development plan shall include details and specifications as may be required by
the village. These details and specifications shall generally include the
following:
      1.   An accurate topographic and boundary line map of the project area
and a location map showing its relationship to other properties.
      2.   The pattern of public and private roads, driveways, and parking
facilities, and intended design standards.
      3.   The size, arrangement, and location of lots or proposed building
groups.
      4.   Location, type and size of proposed landscaping.
      5.   The use, type, size, and location of structures.
      6.   The location of sewer and water facilities.
      7.   Architectural drawings and sketches illustrating the design and
character of the proposed structures.
      8.   The location of recreational and open space areas reserved or
dedicated for public uses such as park and school sites or for other uses.
      9.   Existing topography and storm drainage pattern and proposed storm
drainage system showing basic topographic changes.
      10.   Statistical data on total size of project area, density
computation, proposed number of residential units by type, and any other
similar data pertinent to a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed
development.
      11.   A copy of the intended organizational structure related to any
property owners' association, protective covenants and provision of services.
      12.   Aspects of the maintenance of any common open space areas and the
future use of the property shall be set forth in these documents.
Each development is unique and may require submission of additional
information, and not require submission of certain information. If the
president and board of trustees do not require any of the above details or
specifications with respect to a particular project before enacting the
ordinance granting the PUD and establishing a development plan, that
requirement shall be deemed waived.
   E.   Size: Planned unit developments shall be at least one acre in size.

5-9-1: SCOPE OF REGULATIONS:
The off-street parking and off-street loading provisions of this title shall
apply as follows:
   A.   Accessory off-street parking and off-street loading facilities shall be
provided as required by the regulations of this chapter for all buildings and
structures erected and all uses of land established in each district after the
effective date of this title. However, where a building permit has been issued
prior to the effective date of this title, as amended, and provided that
construction is begun within six (6) months of such effective date and
diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities in the
amounts required for the issuance of said building permit may be provided in
lieu of any different amounts required by this title.
   B.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises shall
be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, sales,
patron service, or customer service floor area, seating capacity, or other
units of measurement in the amount specified herein requiring parking or
loading facilities, such additional parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided.
   C.   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be
changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use. However, if the building or structure was erected
prior to the effective date of this title, additional parking or loading
facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the
new use would exceed those for the existing use. (Ord. 2019-21, 4-16-2019)
5-9-2: EXISTING PARKING FACILITIES:
Accessory off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of
this title and located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not
hereafter be reduced below, or if already less than shall not be further
reduced below the requirements for a similar new building or use under the
provisions of this title. (Ord., 12-15-1964 as amended)
5-9-3: PERMISSIVE PARKING AND LOADING FACILITIES:
Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of
off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or
buildings, provided that all regulations herein governing the location, design,
and operation of such facilities are adhered to, provided said parking spaces
are in the same zoning district as said use or a less restricted zoning
district. (Ord., 12-15-1964 as amended)
5-9-4: RESERVED:
(Ord. 2019-21, 4-16-2019)
5-9-5: CONTROL OF OFF-SITE PARKING FACILITIES:
In cases where parking facilities are permitted on land other than the lot on
which the building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the
same possession as the lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking
facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or long-term
lease, the term of such lease to be determined by the Village Board. The owner
of the land on which the parking facilities are to be located shall be bound by
covenants, filed on record in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Cook
County, requiring such owner, his or her heirs and assigns, to maintain the
required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served or of
the said lease, whichever shall terminate sooner. (Ord., 12-15-1964 as amended)
5-9-6: OFF-STREET PARKING:

enclosed off-street parking spaces for each bus to be parked on the premises
shall be provided in accordance with regulations herein for access, in yards,
design and maintenance and area applicable to accommodating such buses.)
   B.   Exemption: When the application of the off-street parking regulations
specified hereinafter results in a requirement of not more than three (3)
spaces on a single lot in any Business District, such parking spaces need not
be provided. However, where two (2) or more uses are located on a single lot,
only one of these uses shall be eligible for the above exemption. This
exemption shall not apply to dwelling units.
   C.   Computation: When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by this title results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of one-half (1/2) or less may be disregarded while a fraction in
excess of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one parking space. (Ord., 12-15-
1964 as amended)
   D.   Collective Provisions: Off street parking facilities for individual
uses may be provided collectively if: 1) the total number of parking spaces
provided in the off street parking facility is at least equal to the number of
parking spaces required for each individual use; and 2) all regulations
governing location of accessory parking spaces, in relation to the use served,
are adhered to. Further, no parking spaces or portion thereof shall serve as a
required space for more than one use unless otherwise authorized by the Village

   F.   Access: Each required off street parking space shall open directly upon
an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient
means of vehicular access to such parking space, as approved by the Building
Commissioner. All off street parking facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movement. No driveway across public property
at the right-of-way line shall exceed a width of twenty five feet (25').
   G.   In Yards: Off street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be located in
any yard in any zoning district, except front yards and side yards adjoining a
street in the R1, R2, R3, T1, M1, and M2 Zoning Districts. Enclosed buildings
and carports containing off street parking spaces shall be subject to
applicable yard requirements. (Ord. 2019-21, 4-16-2019)

shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on such
property line by a wall, fence, or densely planted compact hedge, not less than
five feet (5') nor more than eight feet (8') in height. There shall be
installed a substantial barrier on or adjacent to the lot line along all open
off street parking spaces and such barrier shall be so located that no portion

preliminary layout is in proper form and shall not receive or consider the
application as filed until all documents are in accordance with the
requirements set forth herein. (1970 Code §35.12)
   B.   Consideration: The real estate development board will study the
preliminary layout in connection with the official plan, including the major
street plan, the zoning ordinance and the topography of the area, and will take
into consideration the general requirements of the community, the particular
requirements of the neighborhood, and the best use of the land to be
subdivided. Particular attention will be given to specific requirements for
parks, playgrounds, school sites, major streets, the adequacy of street
connections and the suitability of the land for development. The preliminary
layout will also be subject to check by the village engineer. This subsection
shall not apply to small subdivisions if the developer has already proceeded
directly with the submission of the final plat, as provided for pursuant to

final agreement as to improvement specifications or costs. It is to be
considered only as approval of general layout design. (1970 Code §35.15)
   E.   Effective Period Of Conditional Approval: Conditional approval of the
preliminary layout shall be effective for a maximum period of twelve (12)
months except that submission within this period of a final plat applying to a

effective period of conditional approval to a maximum of twenty four (24)
months from the date of submission of the preliminary layout. If a final plat
has not been submitted to the real estate development board within these

in the location and of the width indicated on the major street plan. (1970 Code
§35.29)
   B.   When Secondary Streets Required: Secondary streets shall be included
when it is apparent that sufficient traffic will flow from the minor streets
within the subdivision and that such traffic will need to be channeled in
control of the number of access points to the major street. (1970 Code §35.30)
   C.   Street Layout Generally: The street layout shall be devised for the
most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood area. Where necessary
to the neighborhood pattern, existing principal streets in adjoining
subdivisions shall be continued and shall be at least as wide as such existing
streets and in alignment with them. The street layout shall provide for the
future projection of the principal streets into unsubdivided adjoining lands.
(1970 Code §35.31)
   D.   Minor Street Layout: Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use
by through traffic will be discouraged. (1970 Code §35.32)
   E.   Number Of Minor And Major Street Intersections: There shall be a
minimum number of intersections of minor streets with major streets. (1970 Code
§35.33)
   F.   Marginal Access Streets: Where a subdivision has frontage on a major
street, as shown on the major street plan, or on a super highway or other high
volume trafficway and where it is not feasible to have the lots back to such
high volume streets, provision shall be made for marginal access streets. These
marginal access streets shall be approximately parallel to and on each side of
the major street right of way and separated from such right of way by a strip
of land at least ten feet (10') wide. Separation strips may be provided with
screen planting, but such planting shall be so placed that it does not obstruct
vision at intersections. (1970 Code §35.34)
   G.   Street Authorized Adjacent To Railroads, Waterways, Major Streets:
Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way, waterway or
major street, the real estate development board may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right of way or major
street, at a distance suitable for appropriate use of the intervening land.
Such distance shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separations. (1970 Code §35.35)
   H.   Streets At Business Centers: In front of areas zoned or designed for
commercial use, the street width and the roadway width shall be increased on
the side or sides on which the property for commercial use is located by a
merging lane at least fifteen feet (15') wide. This is to ensure the free flow
of traffic without interference by vehicles entering or leaving parking areas.
This is not a parking space requirement and shall in no way affect or diminish
requirements by the zoning ordinance or otherwise for off street parking
facilities; nor shall fulfillment of this requirement and its acceptance by the
real estate development board be deemed approval or endorsement of any change
in zoning necessary for such commercial use. (1970 Code §35.36)

circumstances. (1970 Code §35.38)
   K.   Grades: Street grades shall conform in general to the terrain and shall
be not less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) nor more than five percent
(5%). Street grades shall be such as to provide natural surface drainage of
storm water regardless of the presence or absence of storm sewers. The intent
is to avoid depressions or inverts that will flood in flash storms for which
storm sewers are inadequate. (1970 Code §35.39)
   L.   Cul-De-Sacs: Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed four hundred feet (400') in
length and shall have a turnaround not less than one hundred twenty feet (120')

secondary streets there shall be a tangent at least one hundred feet (100')
long. (1970 Code §35.44)
   Q.   Angle Of Intersections: Street intersections shall be at right angles
or nearly so. Where, because of topographic or other reasons, an intersection
cannot be at right angles, such intersection shall be so designed as to ensure
safety. (1970 Code §35.45)
   R.   Curb Radii: Curb radii shall not be less than twenty feet (20'). Where
an angle of intersection less than sixty degrees (60°) is permitted, curb radii
shall be increased as necessary for safety. (1970 Code §35.46)
   S.   Improvement Of Roadways: The subdivider shall, at his own expense,
improve all streets with a minimum of nine inches (9") base and a bituminous
concrete wearing surface of no less than two inches (2") in thickness;
provided, however, that the president and board of trustees may impose more
stringent specifications for through streets within or adjoining a subdivision
as a condition precedent to accepting any subdivision plat. (1970 Code §35.47;
amd. 1995 Code)
6-4-9: STREETLIGHTS:
The subdivider shall have streetlights installed by the Public Service Company
Division of Commonwealth Edison Company in accordance with their standards for

streets be so arranged that the long dimension of the block be parallel to the
major street and that lots do not front on or have access to the major street.
Where this arrangement is not feasible, marginal access streets may be
required. (1970 Code §35.50)
6-4-11: LOTS:
   A.   Minimum Lot Width And Area: Lots for residential use shall meet
applicable lot width and lot area requirements as set forth in Title 5, Zoning

have a minimum sideage setback of twenty percent (20%) of the width of the lot.
(1970 Code §35.55)
6-4-13: GRADING FOR DRAINAGE:
Lots and blocks shall be so graded as to eliminate depressions that would
accumulate storm water. Grades at building sites shall bear such relationships
to roadway and curb grades as to prevent flooding of basement windows or of
entryways either to basements or to first floor levels in the absence of
basements. Where deemed necessary, the real estate development board may
require the subdivider to submit working drawings showing contours to which the
property is to be graded to provide for the requirements of this section. The
real estate development board shall transmit a copy of the approved drawing to
the building commissioner. In such cases, building permits shall not be issued
unless the lot plan indicates site and building grades consistent with the
grading drawing. (1970 Code §35.60)
6-4-14: NATURAL AND CULTURAL FEATURES:
Outstanding natural and cultural features, such as scenic spots and
watercourses, shall be preserved insofar as possible. (1970 Code §35.61)

a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, an appropriate easement shall be
provided for the watercourse in either an open cut or in an underground
conduit, depending upon the density of development. Where water mains, sanitary
sewers, storm sewers, gas mains, telephone lines, power lines or other
utilities are located on or adjacent to property lines, adequate easements
together with a right of ingress or egress thereto and therefrom shall be
provided and platted. Said easement shall provide that no structure, building
or pavement, except a division fence, shall be placed on said easement and the
plat of subdivision shall so state. Easements shall not be less than ten feet
(10') in width and shall be centered upon the centerline of the utility. Where
more than one utility is to occupy the easement, the easement shall be of such
width as to extend five feet (5') at each side beyond the centerline of the
outermost utilities. Additional width shall be provided where necessary to
accommodate utility pole bracing. The real estate development board may require
evidence of approval by the public utility company of easement width. Where
side lot easements occur adjacent to a driveway, there shall not be less than
ten feet (10') clearance between the easement line and the extreme projection
of the building structure. (1970 Code §35.62)

done in the village. (1970 Code §35.69)
6-5-6: INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Authority: All improvements shall be subject to inspection by duly
authorized and qualified village inspectors both during the course of
construction and after construction is complete. The inspector shall have
authority over materials of construction, methods of construction and
workmanship to ensure compliance with working drawings and specifications. The
contractor shall provide for reasonable tests and proof of quality of materials
as requested by the inspector. Upon due cause, the inspector may require that
work be suspended and due cause shall include weather conditions, questionable
materials of construction, methods of construction, workmanship or nonadherence
to specifications and drawings. (1970 Code §35.70)
   B.   Inspection Reports: The inspector shall prepare and submit to the
village engineer each day a report stating progress of work and giving his
findings as to quality and quantity of materials used and quality and methods
and workmanship. He shall, in particular, call attention to any circumstances
that entail departures from working drawings and specifications such as
unforeseen difficulties of drainage, ground water, poor subsoil, unstable fill
material, unconventional or faulty practices of contractors or other
circumstances. Whenever, in his opinion, such departures are likely to cause
either a lower ultimate standard of performance or a higher construction cost
than could reasonably be anticipated, he shall immediately notify the village
engineer. When an improvement has been completed, he shall prepare a summary
report. (1970 Code §35.71)
   C.   Responsibility Of Subdivider: Approval by the inspector or absence of
inspection shall in no way relieve the subdivider of full responsibility for
adherence by his contractors to specifications and working drawings nor for
high standards of materials, methods and workmanship. (1970 Code §35.72)
   D.   Approval Not Acceptance: Approval by the inspector shall not be deemed
acceptance of the improvement by the village. Acceptance shall be only by
action of the board of trustees and acceptance shall be contingent upon a
favorable inspection report signed by the village engineer. (1970 Code §35.73)
6-5-7: NOTICE REQUIRED WHEN WORK STARTED:
It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or his contractor to notify
the village engineer when work is to be started and to request assignment of an
inspector. The initial notification that a particular improvement is to be
started shall be in writing and shall reach the village engineer in advance of
the date that inspection is to begin. The notice shall be accompanied by an
inspection bond in accordance with section
6-5-11 of this chapter. (1970 Code §35.74)
6-5-8: SUBDIVIDER'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE:
As further assurance of serviceable construction and to provide for repair of
damage resulting from subsequent construction operations of the subdivider or
his contractors, the subdivider shall be responsible for all maintenance of an
improvement for a period of not less than fifteen (15) months following
completion of construction of that improvement; provided, in addition, that the
subdivider shall be responsible for all maintenance of roadways, curb and
gutter, sidewalk, parkway strips and extension boxes and hydrants or water
facilities until all construction work has been completed upon other
improvements, dwellings, buildings, fill and landscaping adjacent to the
improvement under consideration. The guarantee of completion and maintenance
shall recognize the possibility of maintenance costs, and the terms of
guarantee shall provide for reimbursement to the village for any maintenance
expenses incurred by the village in performing maintenance work after failure
of the subdivider to perform such work upon due notice. An improvement shall
not be accepted by the village sooner than fifteen (15) months after completion
of construction nor before all construction work has been completed upon
adjacent improvements, dwellings, buildings, fill and landscaping nor until all
maintenance work is complete. (1970 Code §35.75)
6-5-9: GUARANTEE OF COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   The real estate development board shall not consider approval of the
final plat unless and until the subdivider has guaranteed the completion of all
required improvements within a reasonable period and in compliance with working
drawings and specifications and has guaranteed to maintain said improvements
until they are accepted by the village.
   B.   This guarantee shall be by one or a combination of one or more of three
(3) methods. Only one method shall be applied to one specific improvement.
      1.   The subdivider may post a performance bond prepared in a form
approved by the village attorney and underwritten by a surety company listed as
approved by the board of trustees. The amount of the bond shall be not less
than one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the final estimate of cost of
the improvement as estimated by the village engineer under section
6-5-11 of this chapter. There shall be no reduction in the amount of that
portion of the bond applying to a particular improvement unless and until that
improvement is complete and accepted or approved by the board of trustees. The
subgrade, base course and surface course of a street, alley or parking area
shall be considered as a single improvement from the standpoint of acceptance.
      2.   The subdivider may deposit a cash bond with the village in
accordance with a specific escrow agreement approved by the village attorney
and village engineer and in an amount not less than one hundred twenty five
percent (125%) of the final estimate under section
6-5-11 of this chapter. The deposit shall be held in a special account by the
village and the agreement may provide for partial payouts as work progresses in
amount recommended by the village engineer and approved by the village attorney
as corresponding to the original estimate of unit costs. Partial payouts shall
be contingent upon favorable inspection reports, and the sum of partial payouts
for a single improvement shall not exceed eighty five percent (85%) of the
original deposit for the improvement until and unless the improvement is
complete and accepted or approved by the board of trustees. The subgrade, base
course and surface course of a street, alley or parking area shall be
considered a single improvement from the standpoint of acceptance.
      3.   Upon specific permission of the board of trustees, as recommended by
the real estate development board, the subdivider may elect to complete one or
more improvements prior to approval of the final plat. Where the subdivider
elects to guarantee completion of an improvement by this method, approval of
the final plat shall be contingent upon certification by the village engineer
that the improvement has been completed in accordance with drawings and
specifications; that the inspection reports are favorable, and that guarantee
has been provided to cover cost of maintenance of the improvement in accordance
with section
6-5-11 of this chapter. (1970 Code §35.76)
6-5-10: ACCEPTANCE:
Acceptance of an improvement for the village shall be only by resolution of the
board of trustees upon recommendation of the village engineer. Recommendation
shall be contingent upon:
   A.   Fulfillment of the requirements of section
6-5-8 of this chapter.
   B.   An opinion by the village attorney that satisfactory and proper
conveyances and dedications have been made by the subdivider to the village.
   C.   Improvements being complete and in good repair in accordance with
village standards for improvements.
   D.   Inspection reports indicating compliance with working drawings and
specifications.
   E.   A single improvement shall not be accepted in part; it shall be
complete throughout the subdivision as indicated in the final plat and working
drawings. The subgrade, base course and surface course of a street, alley or
parking area shall be considered as a single improvement.
   F.   Acceptance of an improvement shall constitute release of the applicable
portion of the performance bond or of the applicable portion of the balance of
cash deposit. (1970 Code §35.77)
6-5-11: FEES:
To defray the engineering and inspection expenses incurred by the village in
preparation of checking of preliminary and final cost estimates, working
drawings, specifications, in checking the final plat (prepared by others), and
in executing inspection responsibilities, the subdivider shall be required to
reimburse the village as follows. These are separate and distinct charges from
the fee paid at the time of submission of the preliminary layout 1 :
   A.   If the subdivider elects to have working drawings and specifications
prepared by the village, he shall make a request for preparation of a
preliminary estimate of construction costs for improvements. This request shall
be in writing to the village clerk and shall be accompanied by a certified
check in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to be receipted for by the
village collector. This bond is to guarantee the expenses of preparation of the
preliminary estimate by the village engineer.
   B.   When notified of the amount of the preliminary estimate of construction
costs, the subdivider shall make a further written request to the village clerk
for preparation by the village engineer of a final estimate of construction
costs, working drawings and specifications to be employed in the construction
and inspection of the improvements. In making this request, the subdivider
shall pay over to the village collector an engineering fee equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the engineer's quoted charge to the village as based upon the
practices recommended in the Manual of Professional Practice for Civil
Engineers published by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
   C.   Upon payment of the engineering fee, the one hundred dollar ($100.00)
bond shall be refunded. The one hundred dollar ($100.00) bond shall be
forfeited if the engineering fee is not paid within twelve (12) months after
notification of the amount of the preliminary estimate of construction costs
and a new bond shall be posted with a new request for preliminary estimate.
There shall be no refund of the engineering fee if the project is abandoned or
if approval of the final plat is denied. Any revision of working drawings, for
whatever reason, shall be subject to an additional engineering fee, paid in
advance, in an amount quoted by the engineer.
   D.   If the subdivider elects to have working drawings, specifications and
cost estimates for improvements prepared by an engineer retained by himself, he
shall apply in writing to the village engineer making a request that such
drawings, specifications and estimates be checked by the village engineer. The
application shall be accompanied by two (2) sets of construction prints,
specifications and estimates. The village engineer shall inform the subdivider
of the amount of the charge for this service and the charge shall be based upon
practices recommended by the Manual of Professional Practice for Civil
Engineers. Checking shall proceed after the subdivider has paid over this fee
to the village collector. Additional fees shall be paid for rechecking of
drawings, specifications and estimates arising from revisions made by or
required of the subdivider. There shall be no refund of engineering fees if the
project is abandoned for any reason whatsoever.
   E.   The engineering fee is intended to include preparation or checking of
preliminary and final cost estimates, working drawings, specifications and
staking but it is not intended to include inspection.
   F.   Before grading or construction of improvements is started, the
subdivider or his contractor shall post with the village collector a cash
inspection bond in an amount agreed upon between the village engineer and the
subdivider or contractor as being sufficient to provide for inspection charges
at the current per diem rates. From this bond shall be deducted each day the
inspection expense incurred by the village at the rates set forth below. Any
excess of the bond over total inspection charges will be refunded to the
depositor and any overdraft on the bond shall be provided for immediately by
the contractor to insure continuity of inspection.
   G.   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or contractor to
notify the village engineer in advance as to the dates that construction work
will commence and complete for purposes of determining the number of days of
inspection charge. In the event of dispute, only notification in writing shall
be considered as proof of notice.
   H.   Per diem inspection rates shall be equal to one hundred percent (100%)
of the engineer's quoted charge to the village. If inspection is performed by
an inspector on the village payroll, the charge shall be one hundred twenty
five percent (125%) of the regular salary paid to the inspector computed to an
hourly basis. There shall be not less than a four (4) hour charge for time
spent in any one day. For time spent outside of the regular working hours of
the inspector, the hourly charge shall be two hundred fifty percent (250%) of
the regular salary paid to the inspector computed to an hourly basis. (1970
Code §35.78)

6-5-12: PROTECTION, REPAIR OF EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS:
The subdivider, his contractors and suppliers shall be responsible that
existing improvements and the property of the village are not damaged or
rendered less useful or unsightly by the operations of the subdivider, his
contractors or suppliers. This provision is intended to include damage or
nuisance with respect to the land improvements or landscaping of the village;
damage to existing streets, sidewalks, curb and gutter, parkways by passage
thereover of equipment or trucks or by excavation for any purpose; the spillage
or tracking of earth, sand or rock onto existing streets, sidewalks, curb and
gutter or parkways; the washing by storm water of earth or sand onto streets,
sidewalks, curb and gutter or parkways or into catch basins; damage to water
mains, sanitary sewers, culverts or storm sewers. To reduce or localize the
possibility of damage to streets by heavy trucking, the village engineer shall
instruct the subdivider as to the streets to be used for access to the
subdivision by equipment and trucks, and the subdivider shall be responsible
for enforcement of this instruction upon his contractors and their suppliers.
The subdivider shall make provisions to prevent washing of earth or sand onto
sidewalks, streets, curb and gutter and into catch basins by storm water. Where
deemed advisable, the village engineer shall have the power to require, either
prior to commencement of construction or after construction is in process, that
the subdivider post a surety to guarantee repair of damages or abatement of
nuisance. If the need for surety becomes apparent after construction is in
process, the village engineer shall have the power to order construction
discontinued until surety has been posted. Expenses incurred by the village in
repairing damages, cleaning streets, catch basins and sewers shall be deducted
from the surety. (1970 Code §35.79)

flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except, that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the village
and MWRD and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
   E.   Preliminary Treatment: Where preliminary treatment or flow- equalizing
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactorily and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   F.   Control Manhole: Each industry shall be required to install a control
manhole and, when required by the village and/or MWRD, the owner of any
property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install
a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the village and MWRD. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his
expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
   G.   Measurement, Tests And Analyses:
      1.   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village and/or MWRD.
      2.   The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be
performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the village and/or MWRD, but
not less than once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the
constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the
federal, state and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the
results of measurements and laboratory analyses to the village and MWRD at such
times and in such manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the
expense of all measurements, analyses and reporting required by the village
and/or MWRD. At such times as deemed necessary, the village and/or MWRD reserve
the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside
laboratory service.
      3.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24 hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)
   H.   Special Agreements: No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
village, MWRD and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the village for transmission and MWRD
for treatment, subject to payment, therefor, in accordance with section
7-4-2 of this title, by the industrial concern, provided such payments are in
accordance with federal and state guidelines for user charge system. (Ord. 83-
20, 9-27-1983)

7-5-9: TRAINS BLOCKING STREETS:
   A.   Findings:
      1.   The obstruction of railroad-highway crossings is a matter which is
intimately related to the affairs of the village and is intimately related to
the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the community; and
      2.   The general assembly of the state passed public act 84-796 1  which
excepts trains under certain circumstances from the provisions regulating the
obstruction of traffic at railroad- highway crossings; and
      3.   The corporate authorities of the village believe that the public
health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the village and those
who enter the territorial jurisdiction of the village are not adequately served
by public act 84-796 passed by the general assembly of the state; and
      4.   The state legislature has not preempted the power of the village to
take such concurrent action. (Ord. 88-7, 4-19-1988; amd. 1995 Code)
   B.   Cars Not To Remain On Crossings: No railroad company, railroad
engineer, train conductor or other person shall cause or allow any locomotive
engine, car or cars to stop in or remain upon or cause a blockage of any street
and railroad crossing by way of utilization of the railroad crossing gates,
including malfunction thereof, for a longer period than ten (10) minutes at any
one time; provided, however, that in case a collision shall have taken place,
to remove any obstruction that may be caused thereby. Any railroad company,
railroad engineer, train conductor or other person who violates this subsection
shall be fined pursuant to the Village Fine Schedule, Appendix A, for each
occasion that this subsection is violated. Each occasion shall constitute a
separate offense upon which a penalty shall be enforced.
   C.   Cars To Be Uncoupled: Should any street or railroad crossing in the
village be and remain occupied and obstructed in whole or in part by any train
or railroad cars for and during a period of ten (10) minutes, each and every
railroad company upon whose line of road such obstruction may occur, their
agents or employees, on or before the expiration of ten (10) minutes when, free
from any cause, the entire train cannot be propelled or removed to any side of
any street occupied and obstructed as aforesaid, shall cause such cars as may
be on or near the crossing to be uncoupled and a division of the train removed
from the street and railroad crossing in such manner as to leave the street
entirely free and unobstructed. The train, when again coupled, shall be removed
forthwith from any such crossing as aforesaid. (Ord. 88-7, 4-19-1988; amd. 1995
Code; Ord. 2014-16, 3-4-2014; Ord. 2025-10, 3-18-2025)

7-5-11: HONORARY STREET DESIGNATION PROGRAM:
   A.   Purpose: The village of Worth honorary street designation program (the
"program") provides an opportunity for the community to permanently recognize a
selected individual, group of persons, organization, institution or historic
event (the "honoree"). The program establishes an honorary street designation,
on all or a portion of a public roadway, that is intended to call attention to
the honoree. The street designation does not in any manner alter current
addressing for postal, emergency response or similar services provided by the
village or any outside entity.
   B.   Eligibility And Application: The program is intended to recognize
individuals, groups of persons, organizations, institutions and historic events
that have had a profound positive impact on the village of Worth (the
"village"). Criteria which shall be considered include, but are not limited to,
the following: the honoree should be associated with the geographic location in
which the designation is sought, have a close association with the village, a
distinguished career in which high service has been rendered to or distinction
brought to the village, a reasonable relationship between the importance of the
street being named and the distinction of the person whose name it will bear
and the cultural, historic, humanitarian efforts of the honoree.
Persons interested in pursuing such designation should fully complete the
application form provided by the village. Failure to fully complete the
application may result in its denial or may lead to significant delays in the
approval process.
   C.   Fee: The nonrefundable fee for an honorary street designation is three
hundred dollars ($300.00). This fee shall accompany the application when
submitted to the village clerk's office.
   D.   Review Procedure: The completed application should be submitted to the
village clerk's office at the village hall. After ensuring that the application
has been fully completed, it will be presented to the village president for
review and consideration. If the application is found to be acceptable, the
village president will then present a related resolution to the board for
consideration.
   E.   Legislative Action: The decision to designate an honorary street name
is purely legislative in nature. The village president has sole discretion to
place the matter on the village board agenda. The board has sole authority to
grant or deny the designation.
   F.   Designation Signage: The name printed on the honorary signage must not
in any way conflict with or be confused with another official street name in
the community. The honorary street sign shall be placed directly below or
adjacent to the official street name sign. The honorary sign must be the brown
color that is included in the federal "Manual Of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices".
The applicant will pay for all honorary signage unless such costs are
specifically waived by the board. Upon passing of the honorary street
resolution, the public works department will order the necessary signage and
inform the applicant of the cost and anticipated installation date.
   G.   Removal Of Signage: Once granted, the honorary street designation will
remain for one year and is intended to be permanent displays of public
recognition for that year. However, the village reserves the right to remove
such designations and related signage without notice or cost reimbursement to
the honoree or applicant.
   H.   Questions: Any questions or comments regarding the program should be
directed to the village clerk's office at (708) 448-1181. (Ord. 09-12, 6-16-
2009)

      1.   One course sidewalks shall be constructed as follows: a subgrade
shall be prepared by cutting down or filling up the surface of the ground to an
elevation which, after being thoroughly compacted, shall be five inches (5")
below the sidewalk grade. Wherever filling is necessary, it shall be done with
earth, or other material equally as good for filling purposes, free from animal
or vegetable matter, thoroughly compacted, and placed in layers not more than
twelve inches (12") in thickness.
      2.   Upon said subgrade shall be placed a layer of Portland cement
concrete five inches (5") in thickness; said concrete shall consist of one part
portland cement, two (2) parts torpedo sand and three (3) parts crushed stone
or gravel measuring not less than one-fourth of an inch (1/4") nor more than
one and one-half inches (11/2") in any dimension, all of which shall be free
from dust, loam and dirt, or other foreign substance. Said materials shall be

the village in conjunction with the levying of the municipal telecommunications
infrastructure maintenance fee are exempt from this obligation. (Ord. 02-17,
10-1-2002)
7-12-3: TAX IMPOSED:
   A.   The rate of the village simplified municipal telecommunications tax
imposed under the provisions of sections 5-25 and 5-30 of the simplified
municipal telecommunications tax act, PA 92-526 is 5.0 percent of all gross
charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to service addresses within
the village for telecommunications originating or received in the village.
   B.   Upon the effective date of the simplified municipal telecommunications
tax authorized in this chapter, the simplified municipal telecommunications tax
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights of way within the village by telecommunications retailers.
Imposition of the simplified municipal telecommunications tax provided under

customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the simplified municipal
telecommunications tax attributable to that customer's service address.
   B.   The simplified municipal telecommunications tax shall be remitted by
the telecommunications retailer to the Illinois department of revenue not later
than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in which a bill is
issued to the customer, provided, however, that the telecommunications retailer
may retain an amount not to exceed one percent (1%), payable to the Illinois
department of revenue, of the village simplified municipal telecommunications
tax collected by it to reimburse itself for expenses incurred in accounting for
and remitting the fee.
   C.   Any simplified municipal telecommunications tax required to be
collected pursuant to this chapter and any such simplified municipal
telecommunications tax collected by such telecommunications retailer shall
constitute a debt owed by the telecommunications retailer to the state. The
charge imposed under subsection A of this section by the telecommunications
retailer pursuant to this chapter shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to
the telecommunications retailer who provides such services until paid and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such services.
   D.   If it shall appear that an amount of simplified municipal
telecommunications tax has been paid that was not due under the provisions of
this chapter, whether as a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then
such amount shall be credited against any simplified municipal
telecommunications tax due, or to become due, under this chapter, from the
telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous payment; provided, however,
the village collector may request, and telecommunications retailer shall
provide, written substantiation for such credit. However, no claim for such
credit may be made more than three (3) years after the date of the erroneous
payment unless: 1) the credit is used only to offset a claim of underpayment
made by the village within the applicable statutory period of limitations, and
2) the credit derives from an overpayment made by the same telecommunications
retailer during the applicable statutory period of limitations.
   E.   Amounts paid under this chapter by telecommunications retailers shall
not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts as described
immediately below:
      1.   "Gross charges" for purposes of the telecommunications excise tax
act;
      2.   "Gross receipts" for purposes of the municipal utility tax as
prescribed in section

or structures not located on, over, or within the right of way. (Ord. 97-32,

preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the Village
rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.
   B.   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the Village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the Village and, in particular, the use of

      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the Village's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to facilities locations.
   C.   Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully established

facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.

inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.

parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.

judgment when administering this chapter and may exercise the power described
in section
7-14-21 of this chapter to vary the standards, conditions, and requirements
expressed in this chapter when the Village so determines. Nothing herein shall

sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required under subsection A of this section,
such as evidence that the wireless provider or utility is a "private self-
insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act.
   F.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Wireless Provider Or
Utility's Liability: The legal liability of the wireless provider or utility to
the Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the
insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be
limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any
amounts thereunder.
   G.   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be affected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
(Ord. 2018-08, 6-19-2018)
7-14-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a wireless
provider or utility shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the
Village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to
arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts,
omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the wireless provider or utility or
its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in
the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the wireless
provider's or utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out
of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this by the
Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. (Ord.
2018-08, 6-19-2018)
7-14-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Superintendent of Public Works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Superintendent
of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee
to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of
the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 2018-08, 6-
19-2018)
7-14-11: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:

      1.   Immediately provide the Village with evidence that no cause exists
for the revocation or suspension;
      2.   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the Village within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
      3.   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof of such removal to
the Village within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this subsection.
   D.   Stop Work Order: In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection A of
this section.
   E.   Failure Or Refusal Of The Permittee To Comply: If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection C of this section, the Village or
its designee may, at the option of the Village: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2)
upon not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days'
notice to the permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them
abandoned and property of the Village. The permittee shall be liable in all
events to the Village for all costs of removal. (Ord. 2018-08, 6-19-2018)
7-14-12: CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS:
   A.   Notification Of Change: A utility shall notify the Village no less than
thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   B.   Amended Permit: A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village's right-
of- way.
   C.   Insurance And Bonding: All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer. (Ord. 2018-08,
6-19-2018)
7-14-13: GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
   A.   Standards And Principles: All construction in the right-of-way shall be
consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations, and
commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction principles,
sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles and standards
set forth in the following IDOT publications, as amended from time to time:
      1.   "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction";
      2.   "Supplemental Specifications and Recurring Special Provisions";
      3.   "Highway Design Manual";
      4.   "Highway Standards Manual";
      5.   "Standard Specifications for Traffic Control Items";
      6.   "Illinois Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices" (92 Ill. Adm.
Code section 545);

      8.   "Work Site Protection Manual for Daylight Maintenance Operations".
   B.   Interpretation Of Municipal Standards And Principles: If a discrepancy
exists between or among differing principles and standards required by this
chapter, the Superintendent of Public Works shall determine, in the exercise of
sound engineering judgment, which principles apply and such decision shall be
final. If requested, the Superintendent of Public Works shall state which
standard or principle will apply to the construction, maintenance, or operation
of a facility in the future. (Ord. 2018-08, 6-19-2018)
7-14-14: PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC CONTROL:
   A.   Public Safety: The placement of any antenna, wireless facility or small
wireless facilities located in the Village right-of-way may not interfere with
the frequencies used by public safety agencies for public safety
communications. Unacceptable interference will be determined in accordance with
industry standards and the Federal Communications Commission's regulations
addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum. If an antenna,
wireless facility or small wireless facility causes such interference, the
owner must take all steps necessary to correct and eliminate the interference
at its own costs. The Village may terminate a permit for any antenna, wireless
facility or small wireless facility based on such interference if the
interference is not corrected.
The Village may reserve space on its utility pole for future public safety
uses. This reservation of space may preclude the collocation of a small
wireless facility where the Village determines that the utility pole cannot
accommodate both uses.
   B.   Minimum Requirements: The Village's minimum requirements for traffic
protection are contained in the "Illinois Manual On Uniform Traffic Control
Devices" and this Code.
   C.   Warning Signs, Protective Devices, And Flaggers: The wireless provider
or utility is responsible for providing and installing warning signs,
protective devices and flaggers, when necessary, meeting applicable Federal,
State, and local requirements for protection of the public and the utility's
workers when performing any work on the rights-of-way.
   D.   Interference With Traffic: All work shall be phased so that there is
minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   E.   Notice When Access Is Blocked: At least forty eight (48) hours prior to
beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any residence,
business or institution, the wireless provider or utility shall notify the
resident, business or institution of the approximate beginning time and
duration of such work; provided, however, that in cases involving emergency
repairs pursuant to section
7-14-20 of this chapter, the wireless provider or utility shall provide such
notice as is practicable under the circumstances.
   F.   Compliance: The wireless provider or utility shall take immediate
action to correct any deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are
brought to its attention by the Village. (Ord. 2018-08, 6-19-2018)
7-14-15: LOCATION OF FACILITIES:
   A.   General Requirements: In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of facilities, all facilities, regardless of type, shall be
subject to the general location requirements of this subsection.
      1.   No Interference With Village Facilities: No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the Superintendent of Public Works determines that
the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
Village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the Village's utility facilities.
      2.   Minimum Interference And Impact: The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      3.   No Interference With Travel: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      4.   No Limitations On Visibility: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      5.   Size Of Utility Facilities: The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
      6.   Installation And Maintenance Of Utility Poles: The Village is not
required to install or maintain any specific utility pole or to continue to
install or maintain utility poles in any location if it makes a non-
discriminatory decision to eliminate above- ground utility poles of a
particular type. For Village utility poles with collocated small wireless
facilities in place when the Village makes a decision to eliminate above-ground
utility poles, the Village will, at its discretion, either maintain the utility
pole or install and maintain an alternative utility pole for the collocation of
the small wireless facility, or offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless
provider.
   B.   Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways:
      1.   Overhead Parallel Facilities: An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         a.   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way line
and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole alignment
will permit;
         b.   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from
the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (2') (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         c.   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (4') (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         d.   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         e.   Any ground mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (1')
(0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way
line.
      2.   Underground Parallel Facilities: An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         a.   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (8') (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         b.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above
grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the
right-of-way line or as near as practicable.
   C.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts, Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.
      4.   Overhead Power Or Communication Facility: An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         a.   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC's
rules entitled, "Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines" (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
         b.   Poles are located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right- of-
way line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         c.   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      5.   Underground Power Or Communication Facility: An underground power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         a.   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance free service life; and
         b.   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      6.   Markers: The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations (49 CFR section 192.707
(1989)).
   D.   Facilities To Be Located Within Particular Rights-Of-Way: The Village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   E.   Freestanding Facilities:
      1.   Small Wireless Facilities:
         a.   The Village may not require the placement of a small wireless
facility on a specific utility pole or category of poles. However, should the
application necessitate the installation of a new utility pole, the Village may
propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility
pole or existing support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the
proposed collocation. Should the applicant reject the proposed relocated
collocation, it must provide a written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternative location will
not satisfy the wireless provider's needs. The Village may require any
monopole, utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-
of-way to be screened from view in compliance with the appearance standards
described below.
         b.   If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground
facilities are located on one side of the right-of-way, all new monopoles,
utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same
side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist
above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be
located on the side where the above ground facilities most closely match the
scale of the new freestanding facility.
      2.   Other Facilities:
         a.   The Village may restrict the location and size of any monopole,
utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way. No
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way may be constructed or
modified so that the height of the free standing facility is higher by more
than ten feet (10') or more than ten percent (10%), whichever is greater, than
any other existing, freestanding facility located within the right- of-way
within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed facility, measured along the
center line of the respective right-of-way. Where there are no other
freestanding facilities located within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed facility, the maximum height of the freestanding facility shall be
forty five feet (45').
         b.   The Village may require any monopole, utility pole or other
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be screened from view.
         c.   If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground
facilities are located on one side of the right-of-way, all new monopoles,
utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same
side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist
above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be
located on the side where the above ground facilities most closely match the
scale of the new freestanding facility.
   F.   Height Restrictions For Small Wireless Facilities: Small wireless
facilities are limited to a maximum height of ten feet (10') above the utility
pole or wireless structure on which it is collocated. The height limit of a new
or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure on which small
wireless facilities are collocated is limited to the higher of: 1) ten feet
(10') higher than the tallest existing utility pole within three hundred feet
(300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
that is in the same right-of-way; or 2) forty five feet (45') above ground
level. The Village shall designate which intersecting right-of-way within three
hundred feet (300') of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structure
shall control the height limitation.
   G.   Facilities Installed Aboveground: Aboveground facilities may be
installed only if:
      1.   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      2.   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      3.   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and Municipally-owned infrastructure shall be
used wherever practicable; the installation of additional utility poles or
monopoles is strongly discouraged.
   H.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         d.   The proposed method of attachment;
         e.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         f.   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         g.   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         h.   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   I.   Appearance Standards:
      1.   The Village may prohibit the installation of utility facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   A utility facility may be constructed only if its construction does
not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features
visible to the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners,
and if it does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
(Ord. 2018-08, 6-19-2018)
7-14-15-5: DESIGN AND APPEARANCE STANDARDS FOR SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES:
   A.   Residential Design Standards:
      1.   Purpose: Ensure visually acceptable facility design and to provide
discretion on required and preferred design of small wireless facilities.
      2.   Applicability: These design standards shall apply to each facility
located in a district zoned for residential uses:
         a.   Applicants must use architectural treatments and stealth
techniques to reduce potential visual impacts from all small wireless
facilities.
         b.   All new utility poles installed for the purpose of mounting a
facility must be stealth or camouflaged to blend into the surrounding
environment. Examples of stealth or camouflage designs are presented in figure
1 of this section.
         c.   Small wireless facilities and all ancillary equipment associated
with the facility must not emit sound.
         d.   Cables must be routed directly from the ground through the pole
and equipment enclosures must completely enclose or hide cabling. No exposed
cable is allowed.
         e.   No flashing lights or unnecessary, non-essential stickers are
allowed to be placed on any facility. Stickers must be designed in the same
color as the pole to which they are attached.
         f.   In no case shall equipment block the sidewalk or pedestrian
pathway. All installations must maintain accessibility requirements and
standards.
         g.   All newly installed equipment must be painted with graffiti-
resistant paint to match pole color and surroundings.
         h.   Colors and materials for small wireless facilities shall be
chosen to minimize the visibility of the facility.
         i.   Antennas attached to existing poles or Municipally-owned
infrastructure shall be painted and textured to match the existing structure.
         j.   Any ground-mounted facility shall be painted with non- reflective
matte finish paint using color shades that are comparable or blend with
surrounding natural elements such as soil, trees, or grasslands. Any ground-
mounted facility shall be screened from the yard of the property in front of
which it is located using year-round landscaping materials. The owner of the
ground-mounted facility shall guarantee the landscaping materials for a period
of one year from planting.
         k.   All disturbed pavement and landscaping shall be replaced and
areas of bare or disturbed soils must be re-vegetated. If replacement landscape
is determined to be infeasible the Village may accept mitigation funds to use
elsewhere. The owner of the ground-mounted facility shall guarantee the
restoration work or reseeding for a period of one year.
         l.   No facility may display any signage or advertisements unless
expressly allowed by the Village in a written approval, recommended under FCC
regulations or required by law or permit condition. Every facility shall at all
times display signage that accurately identifies the facility owner and
provides the facility owner's unique site number, and also provides a local or
toll-free telephone number to contact the facility owner's operations center.
All required or permitted signage must face toward the street or otherwise
placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures.

      2.   Applicability: These design standards shall apply to: a) each area,
district, neighborhood or zone expressly designated in the Village's
Comprehensive Plan as having special aesthetic or economic impacts on the
welfare of the community; and b) each redevelopment area designed under the Tax
Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act or the Business District Development and
Redevelopment Act:
         a.   Siting of small wireless facilities in special aesthetic/economic
purpose zones must respect the existing character or design ordinance of
established zone.
         b.   Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment measures
in their applications.
         c.   Effective camouflage so as to disguise the facility so that it
appears to be something other than a facility and is at the same time
compatible with its surroundings (for example, designed to look like a tree).
         d.   Small wireless facilities must be designed so that the facilities
silhouette, mass and color are masked in such a way as to be virtually
indistinguishable from their background.
         e.   Examples of stealth or camouflage designs are presented in figure
1 of this section.
   C.   Design Standards In Historic Districts:
      1.   Purpose: To promote the educational, cultural, economic and general
welfare of the Village by identifying, preserving, protecting, enhancing and
encouraging the continued utilization and the rehabilitation of such areas,
properties, structures, sites and objects having a special historical interest
or value to the Village and its citizens.
      2.   Applicability: These design standards apply in any historic district
or on any historic landmark:
         a.   Districts, sites, buildings, structures or objects, significant
in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering or culture, that are
listed, or are eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic
Places are to be avoided, to the greatest extent possible. Local landmarked
buildings, properties, sites, or historic districts that are so recognized by
an ordinance that meets the requirements of the certified Local Government
Program of the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office are also to be
avoided, to the greatest extent possible.
         b.   Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment measures
in their applications.
         c.   Applicant must implement said Village-approved design concepts,
and the use of camouflage or stealth materials as necessary in order to achieve
compliance with historic preservation review.
         d.   Prior to submitting an application, where the applicant submits
an application to site facilities in a historic district, the applicant must
meet with the Village to discuss any potential design modifications appropriate
for the installation.
         e.   When siting a facility in a historic district, wireless provider
must avoid removing, obscuring or altering any historic material or significant
architectural features. Rehabilitation and make-ready work must not destroy the
distinguishing character of the property or its environment.
         f.   Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather
than replaced, wherever possible by means such as rust removal, caulking,
limited paint removal and reapplication of paint.
   D.   General Design Standards:
      1.   Applicability: These design standards apply to all small wireless
facilities:
         a.   All small wireless facilities not governed by the preceding
design standards must be placed so as to minimize visibility. The small
wireless facility, including all ancillary equipment and appurtenances, must be
a color that blends with the surroundings of the utility pole or Municipally-
owned infrastructure on which it is mounted and use non-reflective materials
which blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and
structures. Any wiring must be concealed within the freestanding facility or
covered with an appropriate cover.
         b.   The Village may discourage the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
         c.   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners.
         d.   A facility may not be installed in a manner which defeats any
existing concealment elements of the utility pole or Municipally- owned
infrastructure to which it is attached.
         e.   Facilities under common ownership or operated on the same radio
frequency shall be separated as far as practicable. (Ord. 2018-08, 6-19-2018)

CHAPTER 4
GRAFFITI
SECTION:
8-4-1: Legislative Findings And Declaration
8-4-2: Definitions
8-4-3: Graffiti A Nuisance
8-4-4: Prohibited Acts
8-4-5: Removal Of Graffiti Required
8-4-6: Graffiti Related Offenses
8-4-1: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION:
   A.   The president and board of trustees hereby find and declare that it is
the right of every person, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national
origin, sex, age, or disability, to be secure and protected from fear,
intimidation, and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and
individuals. It is not the intent of this chapter to interfere with the
exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and
association. The president and board of trustees hereby recognize the
constitutional right of every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any
lawful subject whatsoever, to lawfully associate with others who share similar
beliefs, to petition lawfully constituted authority for a redress of perceived
grievances, and to participate in the electoral process.
   B.   The president and board of trustees find, however, that urban,
suburban, and rural communities, neighborhoods and schools throughout the state
are being terrorized and plundered by street gangs. The president and board of
trustees find that there are now several hundred street gangs operating in
Illinois, and that while their terrorism is most widespread in urban areas,
street gangs are spreading into suburban areas of Illinois.
   C.   The president and board of trustees further find that street gangs are
often controlled by criminally sophisticated adults who take advantage of our
youth by intimidating and coercing them into membership by employing them as
drug couriers and runners, and by using them to commit brutal crimes against
persons and property to further the financial benefit to and dominance of the
street gang.
   D.   These street gangs' activities present a clear and present danger to
public order and safety and are not constitutionally protected. No society is
or should be required to endure such activities without redress. Accordingly,
it is the intent of the president and board of trustees in enacting this
chapter to control street gang related graffiti that focuses upon patterns of
criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs, which
together have been the chief source of their success.
   E.   The presence of graffiti on property within the village offends the
aesthetic sensibilities of its residents, decreases property values, is often
an incitement to crime and is an act destructive to property.
   F.   Graffiti is not only placed on property within the village by
individuals but also by individuals formed into gangs which endorse the act of
placing graffiti on property as a requirement of membership and/or an act
pertaining to membership in said gang.
   G.   Such placement of graffiti by an individual who is a gang member
perpetuates and increases the incidence of graffiti making it more difficult to
make property in the village secure against such destructive acts.
   H.   The definitions in this chapter as they relate to gangs are taken from
the Illinois streetgang terrorism omnibus prevention act, 740 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 147/5 et seq., and should be interpreted in consonance with that
statute. (Ord. 94-16, 5-17-1994)

meanings:

knowingly performs, aids, or abets any such activity; or a candidate for gang
membership.

at the direction, order, solicitation, or request of any conspirator who is a
leader, officer, director, organizer, or other governing or policy making
person or authority in the conspiracy, or by any agent, representative, or
deputy of any such person or authority engages in a course or pattern of
criminal activity; or
      2.   That, through its membership or through the agency of any member
engages in a course or pattern of criminal activity.
   B.   For purposes of this chapter, it shall not be necessary to show that a
particular conspiracy, combination, or conjoining of persons possesses,
acknowledges, or is known by any common name, insignia, flag, means of
recognition, secret signal or code, creed, belief, structure, leadership or
command structure, method of operation or criminal enterprise, concentration or
specialty, membership, age, or other qualifications, initiation rites,
geographical or territorial situs or boundary or location, or other unifying
mark, manner, protocol or method of expressing or indicating membership when
the conspiracy's existence, in law or in fact, can be demonstrated by a
preponderance of other competent evidence. However, any evidence reasonably
tending to show or demonstrate, in law or in fact, the existence of or

herein, or probative of the existence of or membership in any such association,
shall be admissible in any action or proceeding brought under this chapter.

   K.   Heating Systems: Heating systems in service stations that have rooms or
stalls for greasing or servicing motor vehicles shall be of a type that will
preclude the likelihood of gasoline gas reaching the heaters. The following
types are acceptable:
      1.   Steam, hot water or warm air furnaces, cut off from the balance of
the building by eight inch (8") masonry walls are acceptable. The ceiling shall
be of two (2) coats of cement plaster over metal lath or equivalent fire-
resistive construction. The door to a heater room shall open from the outside
of the building. No opening shall be permitted on the inside walls except those
necessary for passage of heat ducts. If warm air heat is used, no cold air
return shall be taken closer than thirty inches (30") from the level of the
grease room floor.
In the heater room, the door may open from the office room, where the heater
room door is sufficiently distant from the grease room door to prohibit the
travel of gasoline gas to the heater room. The floor of the office must be
higher than the floor of the grease room, or a six inch (6") concrete ledge
must be placed across the door opening at the floor in the grease room door or
furnace room door, or both, as gasoline gas is heavier than air and these
features will tend to block its flow.
      2.   The following types of heat are acceptable without enclosure:
         a.   Suspended, approved type, oil or gas fired, warm-air furnaces.
These shall be suspended from the ceiling joists and shall be approximately
eight feet (8') above the level of the grease room floor. Cold air returns
shall be not less than thirty inches (30") from the level of the grease room
floor.

above the level of the grease room floor.
         c.   Electric heating units and equipment located within the possible
path of vapor travel shall be designed and installed so as not to create an
ignition hazard and shall conform with the 1956 edition of the National
Electrical Code, NFPA Pamphlet No. 70, as published by the National Fire
Protection Association.
         d.   In single stall stations, a stove may be used, if mounted
eighteen inches (18") above the floor. Oil heat is required for such stove.
         e.   Stoves may be used in the office section if they are cut off by
partitions from the grease room and the stoves are mounted above the floor
level. (1970 Code §19.33)
   L.   Greasing Pits: Every greasing pit installed in a building or enclosed
by three (3) or more walls, shall be ventilated by a vent duct not less than
six inches (6") in diameter or equivalent cross-sectional area of a noncircular
duct if used. The duct shall start within four inches (4") of the floor and
shall extend on an upward diagonal or by an easy bend over to the sidewall,
thence straight up through the roof to a height sufficient to draw off gasoline
vapors which may accumulate at the bottom of the pit. The floor or pit should
slope slightly toward a corner where a duct is located to facilitate the flow
of gases to said duct.
      1.   Gasoline or naphtha shall never be used to clean out any pit,
whether the pit is located within a building or enclosure, or outside in the
open.
      2.   No sewer connection shall be permitted from any greasing pit, unless
protected with an approved grease trap which will effectively intercept greases
and oils and prevent their entry into the sewer. The trap shall be kept cleaned
out.
      3.   If electrically lighted, globes shall be of vapor-proof construction
and wiring shall be in conduit. (1970 Code §19.34)
   M.   Washing And Greasing Rooms: If sewer connection is made, an adequate
grease trap shall be provided to intercept grease and oils. The trap shall be
cleaned out at least every thirty (30) days. (1970 Code §19.35)

other legally entitled persons and contacting the registered owner, lienholder
or other legally entitled persons by the U.S. mail, public service or in person
for a determination of disposition, and an examination of the state police
stolen vehicle files for theft and wanted information. At the expiration of the
ten (10) day period, without the benefit of disposition information being
received from the registered owner, lienholder, or other legally entitled
persons, the police department will authorize the disposal of the vehicle as
junk or salvage. Provided, however, if a vehicle is classified as antique,

Compiled Statutes 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8 and 5/11-31-2. The
purpose of this chapter is to maintain the village's eligibility in the
national flood insurance program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic
flooding, including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare;
and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic
and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related
land resources. This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following
specific purposes:
   A.   To meet the requirements of 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/18g,
rivers, lakes and streams act;
   B.   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   C.   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood
damage;
   D.   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   E.   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
   F.   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the village by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance
program;
   G.   To comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood
insurance program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended;
   H.   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources; and
   I.   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development. (Ord. 08-06, 3-18-2008)
12-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A nonhabitable structure which is on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
   ACT: An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams
of the state of Illinois, 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes, 5/5 et seq.
   APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
   APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible
and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed
are as specified in subsection
12-1-7B of this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in section
12-1-5 of this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
   BASEMENT: That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING: A walled and roofed structure, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally aboveground, including manufactured homes and
prefabricated buildings. The term also includes recreational vehicles and
travel trailers installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days
per year.
   CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash, or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this chapter, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as built plans.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that
FEMA will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood
boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or
flood insurance rate map, once the as built plans are submitted and approved.
   CONTROL STRUCTURE: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that
passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water
surface elevation.
   CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare
of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood
protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material
(chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances) storage facilities.
Examples of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include:
sewage treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
   DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
   DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on stream lakes, and that
portion of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally
depicted on the FEMA FIRM, which is needed to store and convey the existing
base flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to the
loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%)
increase in velocities.
   A.   The floodways are designated on the countywide FIRMs of Cook County

into the village are designated on the countywide FIRMs prepared of Cook County
panel numbers 17031C0608J, 17031C0609J, and 17031C0616J prepared by FEMA and
dated August 19, 2008, and panel 17031C0617K prepared by FEMA and dated
November 1, 2019.
   C.   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated
floodway boundary should be scaled off the FIRM and located on a site plan,
using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to
determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR
should be contacted for the interpretation.
   DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate including:
   A.   Construction, reconstruction, repair, or placement of a building or any
addition to a building.
   B.   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a

national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 (NGVD).
   NATURAL: When used in reference to channels means those channels formed by
the existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A
natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its floodplain is not
constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or
cultivated; the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the
area with no substantial alteration of the course or cross section of the

12-1-3: REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF CHAPTER PROVISIONS:
The building commissioner shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties
listed in section
12-1-4 of this chapter.
   A.   To fulfill those duties, the building commissioner should first use the
criteria listed in section
12-1-5, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain.
      1.   Once it has been determined that a site is located within a
floodplain, the building commissioner must determine whether the development
site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within an SFHA or
floodplain for which no floodway has been identified.
         a.   If the site is within a flood fringe, the building commissioner
shall require that the minimum requirements of section
12-1-6 of this chapter be met.
         b.   If the site is within a floodway, the building commissioner shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
12-1-7 of this chapter be met.
         c.   If the site is located within an SFHA or floodplain for which no
detailed study has been completed and approved, the building commissioner shall
require that the minimum requirements of section
12-1-8 of this chapter be met.
   B.   In addition, the general requirements of section
12-1-9 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of section
12-1-6,
12-1-7 or
12-1-8 of this chapter.
   C.   The building commissioner shall assure that all subdivision proposals
shall meet the requirements of section
12-1-10 of this chapter.
   D.   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the building
commissioner shall review the requirements of section
 12-1-11 of this chapter to make sure they are met. In addition, the building
commissioner shall complete all notification requirements.
   E.   In order to ensure that property owners obtain permits as required in
this chapter, the building commissioner may take any and all actions as
outlined in section
12-1-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 08-06, 3-18-2008)
12-1-4: DUTIES OF THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER:
   A.   Determining The Floodplain Designation:
      1.   Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a
special flood hazard area (SFHA).
      2.   If they are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway,
flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile.
      3.   Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA
(with a drainage area less than 1 square mile), indicating that the development
would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which
would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain
and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this chapter.
   B.   Professional Engineer Review:
      1.   If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one
square mile, the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer
(PE) under the employ or contract of the village for review to ensure that the
development meets section
12-1-7 or
12-1-8 of this chapter.
      2.   In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in writing
that the development meets the requirements of section
12-1-7 of this chapter.
   C.   Dam Safety Requirements:
      1.   Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage
potential in the event of failure.
      2.   The construction or major modification of all class I (high hazard)
and class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit.
      3.   Some class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety
permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and
the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off channel detention basins that
have an embankment are nonjurisdictional class III dams. It is not required
that IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all nonjurisdictional class III dams.
      4.   A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a
hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is
required.
      5.   A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the
construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams.
      6.   Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or
impoundment structures.
   D.   Other Permit Requirements: Ensure any and all required federal, state
and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
   E.   Plan Review And Permit Issuance:
      1.   Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the
jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of this chapter; and
      2.   Issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when the
development meets the conditions of this chapter.
   F.   Inspection Review:
      1.   Inspect all development projects before, during and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and
      2.   Schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and
document the results of the inspection.
   G.   Damage Determinations: Make damage determinations of all damaged
buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged
structures which must comply with subsection
12-1-9C3 of this chapter.
   H.   Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain permit files
including:
      1.   An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building subject
to section
12-1-9 of this chapter; and/or
      2.   The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been
floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to
section
12-1-9 of this chapter.
   I.   Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies
of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional
letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as
built" elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all
buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
   J.   State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to sections
12-1-7 and
12-1-8 of this chapter, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to
the village. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the
village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      1.   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per the
Illinois Compiled Statutes;
      2.   IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in
section
12-1-2 of this chapter and all other state, federal or local unit of government
projects, including projects of the village and county, except for those
projects meeting the requirements of subsection
12-1-7B1 of this chapter;
      3.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per subsection
12-1-7B3e of this chapter;
      4.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to subsection
12-1-7B3d of this chapter;
      5.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage as indicated in subsections
12-1-7B3a, B3b and B3h of this chapter;
      6.   Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly
navigable rivers, lakes and streams;
      7.   Any changes in the mapped floodway or published flood profiles.
   K.   Cooperation With Other Agencies:
      1.   Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to
improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve
the administration of this chapter;
      2.   Submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a
regulatory map within six (6) months whenever a modification of the floodplain
may change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain
map;
      3.   Submit reports as required for the national flood insurance program;
and
      4.   Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this chapter.
   L.   Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary
to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject however to
the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any chapter changes.
   M.   Substantial Damage and Substantial Improvement Determinations:
Establish procedures for administering and documenting determinations, as
outlined below, of substantial improvement and substantial damage made pursuant
to Section
 12-1-9.
      Determine the market value or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building before the start of construction of the proposed work. In the case
of repair, the market value of the building shall be the market value before
the damage occurred and before any repairs are made.
      1.   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building.
      2.   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or substantial damage.
      3.   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance
with the flood resistant construction requirements of the village and this
chapter is required.
   N.   Variances: If a variance is to be granted, review the requirements of
Section
12-1-11 to make sure they are met. In addition, complete all notifications
requirements.
   O.   Enforcement: In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as
required in this chapter, take any and all actions as outlined in Section
12-1-13. (Ord. 08-06, 3-18-2008; Ord. 2019-51, 10-15-2019)
12-1-5: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for
the village.
   A.   If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not
available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other
sources.
   B.   When a party disagrees with the best available data, he/she shall
submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better
data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to
any development of the site.
   C.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
any river, creek or stream shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood
profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook County prepared by FEMA dated
November 1, 2019, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared
from time to time.
   D.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study prepared
by FEMA and dated November 1, 2019, and such amendments or revisions to such
study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   E.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an "AH zone" or "AO zone" shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County panel
numbers 17031C0608J, 17031C0609J, and 17031C0616J prepared by FEMA and dated
August 19, 2008, and panel 17031C0617K prepared by FEMA and dated November 1,
2019.
   F.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A zone" on the countywide FIRMs of Cook
County shall be according to the best existing data available from federal,
state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must
be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations.
      1.   When no base flood elevation exists, the base flood elevation shall
be determined from an accepted hydraulic model, based on current industry
standards.
      2.   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
an accepted hydrologic model, based on current industry standards, or by
techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States
Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. (Ord. 08-06, 3-18-2008;
Ord. 2019-51, 10-15-2019)
12-1-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of
this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of
section
12-1-9 of this chapter.
   A.   Development Permit:
      1.   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by
law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
development permit from the building commissioner.
      2.   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the building commissioner.
         a.   The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site,
drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the
property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor;
existing grade elevations, using the North American vertical datum of 1988, and
all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings.
         b.   For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans, and the development will be subject to the requirements of section
12-1-9 of this chapter.
      3.   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the building
commissioner shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation.
         a.   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher
than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which
has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
         b.   The building commissioner shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance
rate map identification.
      4.   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall
be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
      5.   The building commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals
or waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The building
commissioner shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and
local permits have been obtained.
   B.   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
      1.   Elevate Using Fill: If fill is being used to elevate the site above
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall
submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for
the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
      2.   Compensatory Storage:
         a.   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
         b.   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
         c.   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be
made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
         d.   All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All
floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
         e.   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
   C.   Construction Of The Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE):
A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a
site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate
the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the village to construct
the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe.
The building commissioner shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant
has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsections:
      1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection B2 of this
section.
      2.   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.,
window wells, accessways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation
(FPE).
      3.   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the
FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet (10') beyond the outside face of the
structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
met, the building commissioner may waive the ten foot (10') minimum setback if
an Illinois licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method
to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met.
The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural
design analysis, which shall be submitted to the building commissioner for
review. The building commissioner may require such additional documentation as
necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the
structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than
four feet (4').
      4.   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of twenty feet (20') from the structure, shall be above the BFE.
However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained,
the building commissioner may waive the twenty foot (20') minimum setback
distance if an Illinois licensed professional engineer certifies that an
alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic
pressures has been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving
that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from
flooding, shall be submitted to the village for review. In no case shall the
setback distance be less than four feet (4').
      5.   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet (5') thick under
the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F,
if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification
and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according
to ASTM standard D-2487, classification of soils for engineering purposes.
      6.   The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the
soil must be all of one material, and the engineering properties must be in the
same direction.
      7.   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by an Illinois licensed professional engineer, as warranted by the
site conditions.
      8.   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five feet (5') below the BFE.
      9.   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and
minimum of one-fourth (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4)
times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away
from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the
floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
      10.   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
      11.   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
      12.   If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set
forth in the preceding subsections, the building commissioner may allow the
construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates
that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set
forth in FEMA technical bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding.
In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from
flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the
proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be
completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA technical bulletin 10-
01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois licensed
professional engineer.
      13.   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in
no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously existing natural
grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation,
if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to
drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted. (Ord. 08-06, 3-18-
2008)
12-1-7: OCCUPATION AND USE OF DESIGNATED FLOODWAYS:
This section applies to proposed development, redevelopment, site modification
or building modification within a designated floodway. The designated floodway
for all rivers or streams with identified floodway shall be as delineated on
the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County and referenced in
section
12-1-2 of this chapter. Only those uses and structures will be permitted which
meet the criteria in this section. All floodway modifications shall be the
minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the project. The development
shall also meet the requirements of section
12-1-9 of this chapter.
   A.   Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body
not exempted by state law shall commence any development in a floodway without
first obtaining a development permit from the building commissioner and IDNR/
OWR.
      1.   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the building commissioner. The application shall include the
following information:

   B.   Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses:
      1.   Appropriate Uses: The only development in a floodway which will be
allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood
elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or
aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate
mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses
listed in 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 will be allowed. The
approved appropriate uses are as follows:
         a.   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.
         b.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses.
         c.   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls.
         d.   Underground and overhead utilities.
         e.   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any
one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including
open air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block
flood flows nor reduce floodway storage.
         f.   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage.
         g.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto.
         h.   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
            (1)   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event
will not exceed 1.0 foot; or
            (2)   The applicant of a short term recreational use facility
parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events
and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all
overbank flooding events.
         i.   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a watercourse.
         j.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure.
         k.   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection
elevation.
         l.   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including, but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building is improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before
the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will
be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
      2.   Exclusions: Appropriate uses do not include the construction or
placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts,
excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise
nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically
defined above as an appropriate use.
      3.   Engineering And Mitigation Criteria: Within the designated floodway,
the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided
that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation
criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and
data by a licensed professional engineer and provided that any structure meets
the protection requirements of section
12-1-9 of this chapter:
         a.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance So As Not To Increase Flood
Stages Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            (1)   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where
"n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, "Open Channel Hydraulics" (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1959).)
            (2)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing
and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover.
            (3)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in
calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following
expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer
can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more
abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
               (A)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
               (B)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length.
               (C)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet
(10') of stream length shall be used.
               (D)   Transition sections shall be provided between cross
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
               (E)   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.
         b.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream
Flooding:
            (1)   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
            (2)   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to
at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
            (3)   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
            (4)   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such
excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
            (5)   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the
location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall
demonstrate through a determination of flood discharges and water surface
elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
            (6)   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a
result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at existing structure.
         c.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream
Erosion Or Flood Heights:
            (1)   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
            (2)   In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood
flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
         d.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches:
            (1)   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or
within recorded flood easements.
            (2)   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
               (A)   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section
12-1-5 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any
commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models.
               (B)   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per
subsection B3b of this section.
               (C)   Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection B3c of
this section.
               (D)   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is
used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be
received.
               (E)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the
bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this
subsection B.
               (F)   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall
be designed per subsection B3h of this section.
         e.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts And
Approach Roads:
            (1)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
            (2)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
            (3)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 (floodway
construction in northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and
concurrence before a permit is issued.
         f.   On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water:
            (1)   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 feet,
when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel
banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as
within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within
recorded flood easements.
            (2)   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must
be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
            (3)   All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section
12-1-2 of this chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Illinois
administrative code part 3702 (construction and maintenance of dams). If the
proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
               (A)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest
by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional storm water
detention;
               (B)   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;
               (C)   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation
basin;
               (D)   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
               (E)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of
this section.
         g.   Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures:
            (1)   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of
the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building.
            (2)   Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be
required for floodproofing activities.
         h.   Excavation In The Floodway:
            (1)   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and
culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
            (2)   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used,
unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
               (A)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length;
and
               (B)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length; and
               (C)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet
(10') of stream length shall be used; and
               (D)   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
         i.   Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
            (1)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment
of a stream side buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable
if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat;
            (2)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
            (3)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
               (A)   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
               (B)   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at
both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they
will prevent erosion.
               (C)   One sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
               (D)   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to
that which is essential for construction of the channel.
               (E)   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable.
Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or riprap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete,
gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
               (F)   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall
be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
               (G)   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such
features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and
flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established,
where appropriate.
               (H)   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end
of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
               (I)   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and
all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
               (J)   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
               (K)   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
            (4)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
         j.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
         k.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in
the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
            (1)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days
prior to the initiation of improvements.
            (2)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be
applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization
shall be provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any
portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may
not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60)
days.
            (3)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
            (4)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25')
in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along
existing channels (see subsection B3p of this section). Construction vehicle
use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be
constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or
along channels shall be restabilized immediately.
            (5)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures And Standards For Urban
Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" (1988) also known as the
"green book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
         l.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         m.   General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
            (1)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in section
12-1-5 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If
the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR
shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base
conditions data to use.
            (2)   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of
the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
               (A)   The requirements of this section for the 100-year
frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
               (B)   Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.
            (3)   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or
a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         n.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision:
            (1)   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
            (2)   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging,
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
            (3)   In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
            (4)   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
            (5)   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
         o.   Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional
engineer.
         p.   Buffer Strips: For all activities in the floodway involving
construction within twenty five feet (25') of the channel, the following
criteria shall be met:
            (1)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within
at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
            (2)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during
the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
         q.   Construction: After receipt of conditional approval of the
designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of
map revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may
proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an
appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is
changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway
map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the
"as built" plans.
      4.   Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State
Review: For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the
following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and
concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or

President and Trustees according to Section
12-1-11(B), the notifications required by Section
12-1-11(C), and a record of hearings and evidence considered as justification
for the issuance of all variances from this ordinance shall be maintained by
the village in perpetuity in accordance with applicable law. (Ord. 08-06, 3-18-
2008; Ord. 2019-51, 10-15-2019)
12-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
   A.   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study.
   B.   Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes.
   C.   This chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside
of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage.
   D.   This chapter does not create liability on the part of the village or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord.
08-06, 3-18-2008)
12-1-13: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FLOOD CONTROL REGULATIONS:
Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance
resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due
investigation, the building commissioner may determine that a violation of the
minimum standards of this chapter exists. The building commissioner shall
notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined the amount set forth in the Village Fine Schedule for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   B.   The building commissioner shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and, therefore,
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      1.   The building commissioner is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in
writing, shall indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work
order. The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      2.   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked
until a hearing is held by the mayor and board of trustees. Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state: a) the grounds
for complaint or reasons for suspension or revocation; and b) the time and
place of the hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to present evidence on his/her behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the mayor and board of trustees shall determine whether the permit
shall be suspended or revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 08-06, 3-18-2008; amd. Ord.
2014-16, 3-4-2014; Ord. 2025-11, 3-18-2025)
12-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
   B.   Where this chapter and other ordinances, easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
   C.   This chapter is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution
which was adopted to meet the national flood insurance program regulations, but
is not intended to repeal the resolution which the village passed in order to
establish the initial eligibility for the program. (Ord. 08-06, 3-18-2008)
