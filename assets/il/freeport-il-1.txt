EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with
the best accepted practice for codification. Each section is self-identifying
as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02 indicates that the
code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code
2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter numbers appear left of
the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal.
The section number appears to the right of the decimal. As another example,
408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 408 (or the
8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For
example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063 follow 660.06 and precede
660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
EDITOR'S NOTE: The 1993 Codified Ordinances of Freeport comprises ordinances
and resolutions enacted by Council or new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. Sections and subsections of the 1993 Codified Ordinances without a
history or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are new
matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance, i.e. the ordinance that approves,
adopts and enacts these Codified Ordinances. In the following table the
disposition of all source material in the 1993 Codified Ordinances of Freeport
is indicated.

(Ord. 94-50. Passed 7-18-94; Ord. 2004-31. Passed 6-7-04.)
   (b)   Except as may be otherwise provided in Chapter 720, Sections 5/8-2 and

attempts to commit, conspires to commit or aids or abets in the commission of
any act declared in any provision of these Codified Ordinances, or in any other
ordinance of the City, to be an offense, whether individually or in connection
with another person, or as principal, agent or accessory, shall be guilty of
such offense. Every person who falsely, fraudulently, forcibly or willfully
induces, causes, coerces, requires, permits or directs another to violate any
provision of these Codified Ordinances, or any other ordinance of the City,
shall likewise be guilty of such offense.
   (c)   In addition to the fine as provided for in this section, a violation
of any provision of these Codified Ordinances, or any other ordinance or
resolution of the City, may be subject to a disposition of court supervision. A
disposition of court supervision may be imposed upon a plea of guilty or a
stipulation by the person violating a provision of these Codified Ordinances,
or any other ordinance or resolution of the City, of the facts supporting the
charge or a finding of guilt, and further proceedings may be deferred and an
order for supervision of the defendant entered, if, having regard to the
circumstances of the offense and the history, character and condition of the
person violating a provision of these Codified Ordinances, or any other
ordinance or resolution of the City, it is determined that:
      (1)   The offender is not likely to commit further crimes;
      (2)   The offender and the public would be best served if the offender
were not to receive a criminal or traffic record; and
      (3)   In the best interest of justice, an order of supervision is more
appropriate than a sentence otherwise permitted.
   If an order for supervision is entered, it shall specify the period of such
supervision and shall defer further proceedings in the case until the
conclusion of the period. Judgment on the violation of a provision of these
Codified Ordinances or any other ordinance or resolution of the City, shall be
deferred until the conclusion of the supervision.
   At the conclusion of the period of supervision, if it is determined that the
defendant has successfully complied with all the conditions of supervision, the
court shall discharge the defendant and enter a judgment dismissing the
charges.
   (d)   Schedule of fines. This Section shall provide fines for certain City
ordinance violations and shall comply with Section
299.11 Schedule of Fines/Penalties. Unless there are aggravating circumstances,
a minimum fine may be paid by a defendant or a person charged with a violation
of these Codified Ordinances upon entering a plea of guilty if the charge is
filed with the Circuit Court, or liable if the charge is filed with the
Administrative Adjudication System of the City. Should the charge be contested,
or should aggravating circumstances be shown, the Judge or Administrative
Hearing Officer has the authority to levy a fine, at his or her discretion,
within the minimum and maximum amounts as set herein by the City Council, if a
finding of guilty or liable is ultimately rendered. For this purpose, multiple
violations within a twelve month period will be considered a subsequent
violation. Aggravating circumstances shall be determined solely at the
discretion of the citing officer or official and shall be constituted by such
things as similar prior offenses or specific circumstances surrounding the
offense which could lead to a heightened fine being imposed at a hearing. In
such cases, a mandatory appearance will be indicated on the citing instrument.

possible opportunity to be present at the discussion of public issues by the
public bodies of the City. If any provision of this section contradicts a

control.
(Ord. 93-14. Passed 4-5-93.)
216.02 COMPLIANCE WITH ILLINOIS OPEN MEETINGS ACT.
   All committees, boards or commissions of Council or of the City, whether
created by State statute or by Council action (hereinafter referred to as "City
public bodies"), shall strictly comply with all of the applicable provisions of
the Illinois Open Meetings Act, as now or hereafter amended. Persons
constituting a majority of a quorum of a City public body shall not discuss any
matter or issue pending before that City public body of which they are members
without first complying with the notice provisions of Section
216.03. This rule shall apply regardless of whether the discussion occurs at a
planned event or at an informal and unplanned social occasion. No City public
body shall discuss any matter or issue at a special meeting if that matter or
issue was not listed on the agenda portion of the notice of special meeting for
that meeting.
(Ord. 93-14. Passed 4-5-93.)
216.03 NOTICES.
   All City public bodies shall obey all of the provisions of the Illinois Open
Meetings Act, including, but not limited to, the following:
   (a)   Prior to January 1 of each year, each City public body shall publish
and post on the public bulletin board within the City Hall Building located at
314 West Stephenson Street in the City of Freeport, County of Stephenson and
State of Illinois a written notice of the date, time and place of all of the
regular meetings of such City public body for that calendar year.
   (b)   At least forty-eight hours prior to any meeting post on the same
public bulletin board as described in subsection (a) hereof, and at the
building where the meeting shall occur, a written notice of the meeting,
including the date, time, place, agenda (including a list of the description of
every matter to be discussed if a special meeting or of every matter on which
final action shall be taken if a regular meeting), date of posting, and whether
an executive session is expected to occur during the meeting (failing to
include in the notice of regular meeting that an executive session may be held
shall not prevent the City public body from conducting an executive session
during said regular meeting).
   (c)   Each of the notices provided in subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall
be provided to any news medium or any member of the public who has filed an
annual request for such notices. Every member of the general public shall have
the right to attend any meeting of the City public body which is not held in
executive session as allowed under the Illinois Open Meetings Act.
   (d)   The City Clerk shall maintain a file available for public inspection
with all of the removed notices provided in subsections (a) and (b) hereof for
the last two years.
   (e)   It shall be the obligation of the Chair of each City public body to
ensure that all notices of special meetings or of regular meetings of his or
her City public body are transmitted in writing to the Office of the City Clerk
to comply with the posting requirements of the Illinois Open Meetings Act.
(Ord. 93-14. Passed 4-5-93; Ord. 2017-17. Passed 2-21-17.)
216.04 EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
   Executive sessions are those meetings or portions of meetings of City public
bodies from which the general public is excluded. Each City public body shall
comply with the following provisions:
   (a)   Prior to going into executive session, the member making the motion
shall clearly state the reason for the executive session, and if the session is
to be held to discuss pending litigation, the moving member shall identify the
litigation by name, court file number and the name of the court where the
litigation is pending.
   (b)   Litigation shall not be considered "imminent" for the purposes of
holding a valid executive session unless the opposing party or his or her
counsel shall have stated to a City official that the litigation will be the
probable course of action unless his or her demands are met.
   (c)   Before an executive session shall be held, a roll call vote shall be
conducted and the motion, the reason for the executive session and the vote for
executive session shall be recorded in the minutes of the open portion of the
meeting.
   (d)   In the motion for executive session, the moving member shall specify
which persons who are not members of the City public body may be present in the
room during the executive session. If the City public body going into executive
session is a subordinate body to another City public body, then all members of
the superior City public body shall be entitled to be present during the
executive session regardless of whether they are also members of the inferior
City public body, e.g. Council members are allowed to be present at all
meetings of Council committees regardless of whether the Council member is also
a member of that committee.
   (e)   The City public body shall not discuss any matter in executive session
which is not directly related to the stated reason for the executive session.
   (f)   When acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, a City public body shall not
conduct deliberations in executive session.
   (g)   A City public body shall not conduct an executive session for the
purpose of discussing a matter with its attorney or discussing a pending or
possible agreement with an independent contractor, unless such discussion is
directly related to one of the reasons for an executive session specified in
the Illinois Open Meetings Act.
   (h)   No final action may be taken in executive session, but the City public
body may vote in executive session so long as the motion, and the second, shall
be repeated verbatim once the City public body returns to open session and a
public vote is then taken on the motion during the open session.
   (i)   Before returning to open session, the City public body shall conduct a
roll call vote to end the executive session, which motion and vote shall be
repeated during the open session and be recorded in the minutes of the open
session.
(Ord. 93-14. Passed 4-5-93.)
216.05 MINUTES.
   (a)   If not already designated by State statute or by Council action, the
chair of each City public body shall, by January 1 of each year, designate a
member of the public body or a City employee to keep written minutes of the
regular and of the special meetings of the City public body during that
calendar year. These minutes shall include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   The date, time and place that the meeting was convened;
      (2)   The time when and the place where the meeting was adjourned or
recessed;
      (3)   Whether the meeting was adjourned or recessed;

including a copy of the call for the special meeting, if such document exists;
      (7)   For the text of each motion, the movant, the seconder, the vote
thereon and the adoption or rejection of the motion; and
      (8)   A brief synopsis of each matter discussed during the meeting.
   (b)   Copies of the minutes for each meeting shall be transmitted to the
City Clerk within seven days after their approval by the City public body, or
within thirty days after the termination of the meeting, whichever occurs
first.
   (c)   The City Clerk shall keep the minutes of the open sessions of the
meetings of each City public body available for public inspection for a period
of three years after the date of such meeting. The City Clerk shall keep
minutes of the executive sessions of the meetings of each City public body
sealed until the City Clerk is directed by the City public body to open such
minutes for public inspection.
   (d)   In January and July of each year, each City public body shall review

City, Committee or Advisory Board of the City, respectively, via electronic
means (such as by telephone, video, or internet connection) provided that such
attendance is in compliance with this section and with any applicable laws.
   (a)   A member wishing to attend a meeting electronically should notify the
City Clerk at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, unless impractical, so that
necessary communications equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the
necessary technical arrangements will result in a denial of a request for
electronic attendance. Upon receiving the electronic attendance request, the
City Clerk shall inform the City Manager of the request.
   (b)   A member may only attend a meeting electronically if that member is
unable to physically attend because of: (1) personal illness or disability; (2)
employment purposes or City business; or (3) a family or other emergency.
   (c)   In order for a member to attend a meeting electronically a quorum of
the Council, Committee or Advisory Board, as the case may be, must be
physically present throughout the meeting and a motion authorizing the member's
electronic presence is made, seconded, and approved by two-thirds of the
members physically present at the meeting. If said motion achieves the required
vote by the members physically present at the meeting, then the request by the
member to attend the meeting electronically shall be approved, and the City
Clerk shall announce the member present electronically at the time the result
of the vote is announced. If said motion fails to achieve the required vote by
the members physically present at the meeting, then the request by the member
to attend the meeting electronically shall be denied, and the City Clerk shall
declare the requesting member absent.
   (d)   The member participating electronically must be able to communicate
effectively with all other participants in the meeting, and members of the
audience must be able to hear all communications at the meeting site.
   (e)   Any member attending electronically shall be considered an off-site
attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting. The meeting
minutes shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member is
physically present or present by electronic means.
   (f)   In any meeting in which a member is attending electronically, all
votes taken at such meeting shall be in the form of a roll call vote.
   (g)   A member permitted to attend electronically will be able to express
his or her comments during the meeting and participate in the same capacity as
those members physically present, subject to all general meeting guidelines and
procedures previously adopted and adhered to. The member attending
electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as to any vote taken.
Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically shall be called
during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the City
Clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member
attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any
member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his or her
leaving and returning.

Manager, or impose a fine upon the violator, or both. The particular findings
in the case, any recommendation for discipline, and any fine imposed shall be a
matter of public information.
      (6)   If the hearing was closed to the public, the respondent may file a
written demand for a public hearing on the complaint within seven business days
after the issuance of the recommendation for discipline or imposition of a
fine, or both. The filing of the demand shall stay the enforcement of the
recommendation or fine. Within fourteen days after receiving the demand, the
Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the complaint upon at least forty-
eight hours' public notice of the hearing and allow both parties the
opportunity to present testimony and evidence. Within seven days thereafter,
the Commission shall publicly issue a final recommendation to the alleged
violator and to the City Manager or impose a fine upon the violator, or both.

any election at which the respondent is a candidate, the Commission shall
render its decision as required under subsection (e) hereof within seven days
after the complaint is filed, and during the seven days preceding that
election, the Commission shall render such decision before the date of that

272.02 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE FOR ACCESSIBILITY CLAIMS.
   There is hereby adopted the following grievance procedure for persons who
claim the City is violating the facility and program accessibility requirements
of the regulations issued by the United States Department of Justice pursuant
to the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA):
   (a)   A complainant shall submit any complaint regarding access or alleged
discrimination, in writing, to the City's ADA Compliance Officer for
investigation and resolution. The ADA Compliance Officer shall maintain files
containing all complaints and of all action taken. The ADA Compliance Officer
shall render his or her written decision within fifteen working days after
receipt of the complaint.
   (b)   If the complaint is not resolved to the satisfaction of the
complainant by the ADA Compliance Officer, then the complainant may appeal the
ADA Compliance Officer's decision by sending a request, in writing, to the ADA
Compliance Officer. The complaint shall then be referred to the City's ADA
Compliance Commission.
   (c)   The Commission shall establish ground rules or procedures for hearing
complaints, requests or suggestions from disabled persons regarding access to
and participation in public facilities, services, activities and functions in
the community. Further, the Commission shall conduct hearings on all such
complaints only in strict compliance with the Illinois Open Meetings Act and in
an objective, unbiased manner. The Commission shall issue a written decision
within thirty days of receipt of the request for referral. All hearings
conducted by the Commission shall be recorded by a court reporter or by
electronic means. Transcripts shall be prepared only upon request and payment
of the applicable cost by the requestor, unless such fee is waived by the
Commission for good cause shown as being in the public interest. The Commission
shall maintain its files and tapes for no less than three years after it
concludes its work on such complaint.
   (d)   The complainant may appeal the decision of the Commission to the City
Manager, by sending a written notice of such appeal to the office of the City
Clerk within fifteen working days of the complainant's receipt of the decision
of the Commission. In such notice, the complainant shall state why the decision
of the Commission is in error and shall state the complainant's requested
action by the City to remedy the violations alleged in the complaint. The City
Manager shall conduct a hearing and shall issue his or her written decision
within thirty days of the closing of the hearing. The decision of the City
Manager shall be final.
   (e)   A record of action taken on each request or complaint shall be
maintained as part of the records or minutes at each level of the grievance
process.
   (f)   The complainant's right to a prompt or equitable resolution of the
complaint shall not be impaired by his or her pursuit of other remedies, such
as the filing of a complaint with the United States Department of Justice or
any other appropriate Federal agency. Furthermore, since the filing of a
lawsuit in State or Federal court can occur at any time, the use of this
grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies.

except those listed in subsection (d) hereof, shall be grouped into classes,

preclude the assignment of other duties by the department heads concerned. A
class specification shall be considered in its entirety and in relation to
other class specifications in determining the class to which a position would
be allocated. The duties described in the job specifications are general and
are necessarily brief. The listed duties shall not be considered all-inclusive
or a limitation in any way. The City retains the right to add to, subtract from
or modify duties at any time to keep the classifications up to date.

code and a class grade for each class, as set forth in subsection (d) hereof,

290.03 SPECIAL SALARY PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Plus Rates for Higher Skills. In any case where an employee is
qualified for, and is temporarily required to serve regularly in and accept the
responsibility for, work in a higher class of positions, such employee shall
receive the entrance rate of that class or one step rate above his or her
present rate, whichever is higher, while so assigned, subject to the approval
of the City Manager. To qualify for a higher rate of pay, such temporary
assignment to a higher class of position shall be regular and continuous in
character for at least one full week. An employee may be temporarily assigned
to the work of any position of the same or lower class grade without change in
pay.
(Ord. 96-40. Passed 6-17-96.)
   (b)   Compensation for Supervisors. All Supervisors shall be paid at a
higher rate than their subordinates. In the event that, because of difference
in length of service, a supervisor is paid a rate of pay equal to or lower than
one or more of his or her duly assigned subordinates, the supervisor shall be
advanced to a step in his or her salary range which will provide him or her
with a rate of pay one increment higher than any subordinate, regardless of the
supervisor's length of service. For the purposes of this subsection, a City
employee holding a current and valid professional license from the State of
Illinois in law, architecture, engineering or accounting and performing such
professional duties as part of his/her City employment shall not be considered
a “subordinate.”
   (c)   Compensation of Temporary and Seasonal Employees. Temporary or
seasonal employees occupying classified positions shall be employed initially
at the hourly rate equivalent to the entrance rate in the range for the class
in which employed. All employees working less than the full work year may be
advanced in pay, based upon satisfactory service, to the higher rates in the
grade for the class, except that only actual hours of work shall be considered
in the computation of service requirements for such advancement. When the
hourly equivalent of required periods of service has been attained, advancement
to the higher step rates may be effected in accordance with Section
290.05. The accumulation of service toward advancement within a range shall
continue unless interrupted by a period of absence from the City service of
more than one year.
   (d)   Partial Compensation Received From Other Sources. In any case in which
part of the compensation for services of any employee, exclusive of pay for
overtime service, is paid by any outside agency or from private sources for
work performed during normal duty hours, any such payments shall be deducted
from the compensation prescribed for the position in this chapter to the end
that the total cash compensation paid to any employee for regular full-time
services from all sources combined for any period shall equal the amount
prescribed in this chapter.
(1977 Code §23-103; Ord. 90-27. Passed 3-19-90; Ord. 2006-10. Passed 3-6-06;
Ord. 2017-56. Passed 7-17-17; Ord. 2019-18. Passed 4-1-19.)
290.04 ENTRANCE SALARY RATES.
   (a)   Starting Rate. An original appointment to any position or the
placement of an employee under the Compensation Plan shall be made at the
entrance rate, and advancement from the entrance rate to the maximum rate
within a pay range shall be by successive steps. Upon recommendation of the
department head, the City Manager may approve compensation at a rate higher
than the minimum rate in the pay range for the class when the needs of the
service so require, provided that any such exception is based on the
outstanding and unusual character of the employee's experience and ability over
and above the qualification requirements specified for the class, when an
employee is unfairly affected by changes from one pay plan to another or when a
critical shortage of applicants exists. In the latter case, any incumbents in
the same class and grade receiving a lower rate shall have their rates
increased to the rate established for entrance of new employees. Should an
employee start at a higher rate due to one of the enumerated reasons, such
employee shall receive future step increases as if they had equivalent prior
service credit at the step in which they are placed.
   (b)   Starting Rate on Return to Duty. When an employee returns to duty in
the same class of position after a separation from the City service of not more
than one year, which separation was not due to discreditable circumstances,
such employee shall receive the rate in the pay range at the step corresponding
to the step of the rate received at the time of separation and shall
subsequently serve thereat for at least such period as is normally required for
advancement to the next higher rate.
   (c)   Starting Rate on Return From Military Service. Any employee who leaves
or has left the City service to enter the active service of the Armed Forces of
the United States, and who subsequently is reinstated to a position previously
held by him or her, shall be entitled to receive the rate of compensation at
the step to which he or she would have been entitled had his or her service
with the City not been interrupted by service in the Armed Forces.
   (d)   Starting Rate in a New Position. Whenever an employee is assigned to
duty in a position not previously held by him or her, and such change is not in
the nature of a promotion, he or she shall receive the entrance rate in the
range established for such position or such other rate within the applicable
range as he or she may be entitled to by reason of crediting him or her in his
or her new position with such prior service that is found to meet the following
conditions:
      (1)   The character and nature of the duties of the position to which the
employee was assigned are similar to those of the new position; and
      (2)   The service in the former position provided experience valuable to
the performance of the new position.
   (e)   Rate of Pay on Promotion. In any case where an employee is promoted to
a class with a higher base maximum rate, the entrance rate shall be at the
lowest step in the higher range that will provide an increase of about ten
percent over the rate received immediately prior to such promotion, provided
that in cases where the maximum rate of the position to which the employee is
promoted is only five percent above the maximum rate of the former position,
the increase on promotion shall be about five percent. Advancement to the
maximum rates subsequent to promotion will be on the same basis as described in
Section
290.05(b).
   (f)   Starting Rate on Demotion. When an employee is demoted to a position
for which he or she is qualified, he or she shall receive the rate in the lower
pay range which provides the smallest possible decrease in pay if the action
was not for cause, or, if the action was for cause, any lower step in the range
deemed appropriate by the department head involved and approved by the City
Manager.
(1977 Code §23-104; Ord. 90-34B. Passed 6-18-90; Ord. 2008-29. Passed 5-5-08;
Ord. 2017-56. Passed 7-17-17.)
290.05 PROBATION; ADVANCEMENTS WITHIN A PAY RANGE.
   (a)   After initial appointment or promotion to a position covered by this
chapter, the first six months of service in the position to which an employee
is appointed or promoted shall be considered the period of probation, except
for uniform police and fire personnel, who shall serve a one-year probationary
period. In the event the employee does not satisfactorily complete his or her
probationary period, he or she shall be separated from the service, except
that, in the case of promotion from a lower position, he or she shall revert to
such lower position with the rate of pay to which he or she would have been
entitled had he or she continued to serve in such lower position without
promotion.
   (b)   An employee whose entrance is at the minimum of the base range shall
be advanced one step in the appropriate range effective following the
successful completion of the probationary period. Subsequently, all employees
shall be advanced to the higher rates based upon length of service. Such
advancement shall be made according to the lengths of service specified in the
salary schedule until the employee has reached the maximum base rate of the
class grade for his or her position. An employee shall receive his or her
longevity raise effective on the employee's anniversary date.
(1977 Code § 23-104; Ord. 90-34B. Passed 6-18-90; Ord. 2004-66. Passed 11-15-
04.)
290.06 REQUIREMENTS AS TO CONTINUITY OF SERVICE.
   Service requirements for advancement within pay ranges and for other
purposes as specified in this chapter shall have the implication of continuous
service, which means employment in the City service without break or
interruption. All leaves of absence with pay and leaves without pay of ten or
fewer days shall not interrupt continuous service nor be deducted therefrom.
Absences on leave without pay in excess of ten days, except for extended
service with the Armed Forces of the United States, shall be deducted in
computing total service but shall not serve to interrupt continuous service.
All absences without leave in excess of three consecutive work days shall be
deducted from and shall interrupt continuity of service.
(1977 Code § 23-104; Ord. 90-34B. Passed 6-18-90.)
290.07 WORK PERIOD.

290.11 LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
   (a)   Vacation Leaves.
      (1)   All non-bargaining employees who, as of their anniversary date
every year, attain the years of continuous service with the City as set forth
below, shall earn vacation hours with pay as follows:
            From the date of entry to the last day of year seven - 80 hours
yearly at 3.08 hours per pay period.
            From the first day of year eight to the last day of year thirteen -
120 hours yearly at 4.62 hours per pay period.
            From the first day of year fourteen to the last day of year
nineteen - 160 hours yearly at 6.15 hours per pay period.
            From the first day of year twenty forward - 200 hours per year at
7.69 hours per pay period.
            An employee hired in 2015 shall continue to earn eight paid
vacation hours per each complete month of work for the City, until such time as
he or she has earned a total of eighty paid vacation hours. He or she shall
then cease to accrue any additional paid vacation hours until his or her one
year anniversary date in calendar year 2016, at which time he or she shall
begin the accrual method for paid vacation hours as stated above.
            Part-time permanent employees shall earn vacation and holiday pay
on a pro-rated basis to that of a full-time employee.
            *On the effective date of this change, each employee shall be
credited with the amount of vacation on a pro-rata basis since their last
anniversary date.
      (2)   Absence on account of sickness, injury or disability in excess of
that hereinafter authorized for such purpose may, at the request of the
employee and within the discretion of the department head, be charged against
vacation leave allowance. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
override or be in conflict with the City’s FMLA policy.
      (3)   Each department or office head shall keep records of vacation leave
allowances and shall schedule vacation leaves with particular regard to the
seniority of employees, to accord with operating requirements and, insofar as
possible, with the request of the employee.
      (4)   During the vacation herein provided for, the employee shall be
entitled to full pay for such period at the regular rate of compensation,
provided, however, that hourly employees shall be compensated on the basis of
straight time for eight hours per day, forty hours per week, and no vacation
benefits shall be paid on the basis of time and one-half.
      (5)   In the event that a paid legal holiday as prescribed in this
chapter falls during the vacation period herein provided for, the vacation
period shall be extended one working day.
      (6)   Employees covered under this chapter shall cease accruing vacation
hours once they reach five weeks (200 hours) unused vacation and the employee
shall not accrue or earn any additional paid vacation hours until said
employee's total of unused paid vacation hours is less than the said five weeks
(200 hours) limitation with the following exceptions:
         A.   The Fire Department sworn personnel covered by a collective
bargaining agreement shall refer to the agreement regarding applicable vacation
hours and maximum accrual of vacation hours. Any Fire Department employee who,
by reason of promotion to a non-bargaining position, the rank of Deputy Chief
or higher, has accumulated an amount of vacation in excess of 200 hours, will
be allowed 12 months from the date of promotion to reduce the vacation
accumulation to 200 hours. All vacation hours remaining above 200 hours at the
conclusion of the 12 month period will then be paid out at the employee's
regular hourly rate of pay. Any Fire Department employee, previously promoted
to a non-bargaining position, the rank of Deputy Chief or higher, with a
vacation accumulation exceeding 200 hours, shall in the calendar year 2020,
reduce the vacation accumulation to 200 hours. All vacation hours remaining
above 200 hours at the conclusion of the calendar year will then be paid to the
employee at the employee's regular hourly rate of rate. Thereafter, the
employee shall cease accruing vacation hours upon reaching five weeks (200
hours) unused vacation.
         B.   The Police Department sworn personnel covered by a collective
bargaining agreement shall refer to the agreement regarding applicable vacation
hours and maximum accrual of vacation hours. Any Police Department employee
who, by reason of promotion to a non-bargaining position, the rank of
Lieutenant or higher, has accumulated an amount of vacation in excess of 200
hours, will be allowed 12 months from the date of promotion to reduce the
vacation accumulation to 200 hours. All vacation hours remaining above 200
hours at the conclusion of the 12 month period will then be paid out at the
employee's regular hourly rate of pay. Any Police Department employee,
previously promoted to a non-bargaining position, the rank of Lieutenant or
higher, with a vacation accumulation exceeding 200 hours, shall in the calendar
year 2020, reduce the vacation accumulation to 200 hours. All vacation hours
remaining above 200 hours at the conclusion of the calendar year will then be
paid to the employee at the employee's regular hourly rate of rate. Thereafter,
the employee shall cease accruing vacation hours upon reaching five weeks (200
hours) unused vacation.
   (b)   Sick Leave.
      (1)   All employees covered by this chapter, except temporary and
seasonal employees, shall be entitled to sick leave with pay. Sick leave credit
shall accrue for full-time employees at the rate of one work day with pay for
each completed month. Sick leave credit shall accrue for permanent part-time
employees on a pro-rated basis to that of a full-time employee.
      (2)   Unused sick leave credit may be accumulated up to a maximum of
1,300 hours. For present employees who have accumulated more than 1,300 hours
of sick leave credit, no sick leave credit shall accrue until such employee's
sick leave credit shall have been reduced by the use of authorized sick leave.
      (3)   Employees absent from work because of legal holidays, sick leave,
vacations, disability arising from injuries sustained in the course of their
employment, authorized leaves of absence with pay, and authorized leaves
without pay for not more than ten days in any one calendar year, shall continue
to accumulate sick leave at the regularly prescribed rate during such absence
as though they were on duty, subject to the maximum limitation provided herein.
      (4)   An employee eligible for sick leave with pay may use such sick
leave, upon approval of his or her department or office head, for the
employee’s own personal medical needs, and also for the illness, injury or
medical appointments for members of the employee’s immediate family. An
employee on sick leave shall inform his or her immediate supervisor of the fact
and the reason therefor as soon as possible, and failure to do so within a
reasonable time may be cause for denial of pay for the period of absence. The
department head may require a doctor's certificate before approving sick leave
with pay, and he or she shall require a doctor's certificate if the absence
from work exceeds five working days. The illness or injury, as the terms are
used in this paragraph, which will make an employee eligible for sick leave
shall be construed to mean any physical or mental impairment which makes an
employee unable to perform the duties of any position which might reasonably be
assigned to him or her by the department head. The term "immediate family," as
used in this paragraph, shall mean the spouse, domestic partner, child, mother,
father, stepmother, stepfather, sister, brother, mother-in-law, father-in-law,
grandchild, and grandparent of the employee. Use of sick leave with pay for
absence due to illness in the employee's immediate family shall be limited to
an amount not less than the personal sick leave that would be accrued during
six months at the employee’s then current rate of entitlement and the
department head shall have the authority to adopt rules and regulations to
implement this provision to guard against abuse of the use of sick leave for
this purpose. This sick leave policy shall be enforced in such a way as to not
interfere with or contradict the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 or any
of its amendments.
      (5)   Absences for a fraction or part of a day that are chargeable to
sick leave in accordance with this subsection shall be charged proportionately
in an amount not smaller than one hour.
      (6)   Fire Department personnel on the platoon system schedule shall
accumulate sick leave on the basis of one day for each month of service,
provided that sick leave shall be charged at the rate of two days for each
twenty-four hour shift missed. If only part of a twenty-four hour shift is
missed, the employee shall be charged in proportion to the time missed in
amounts not smaller than one-half day of sick leave.
      (7)   Upon the retirement of an employee with twenty or more years of
employment with the City, reimbursement to said employee shall be paid at fifty
percent of the unused sick time accumulated during the employee's tenure of
service with the City. Reimbursement shall be at a rate of twelve dollars
($12.00) per eight hours of sick leave benefit remaining.
      (8)   Whenever an employee in the City service is injured or contracts an
occupational disease while acting in the course of his or her employment,
resulting in time lost from work, that portion of the time so lost which is
compensable under the Illinois Worker's Compensation Act or the Illinois
Occupational Disease Act shall not be charged against any sick leave to which
he or she is entitled under the terms of this subsection.
   (c)   Special Leaves; Jury Duty and Court Appearances. In addition to leaves
authorized in this section, the City Manager may authorize special leaves of
absences with or without pay for personal, educational or other reasons. An
employee must make prior written request, and, if the leave is granted, the
authorization for leave shall be in writing and shall specify the beginning and
ending days. The City Manager may grant paid leave of absence and unpaid leave.
An employee may be absent for jury service and attending court as a witness,
and the City shall pay such employee the difference between his or her regular
City pay and the payment he or she receives for jury service or attending court
as a witness.
   (d)   Absence Without Leave. Any employee who is absent from duty shall
report the reason therefor to his or her supervisor prior to the start of his
or her shift. All unauthorized and unreported absences shall be considered
absence without leave, and deduction of pay shall be made for the period of
absence. Such absence may be made the grounds for disciplinary action.
   (e)   Bereavement Leave. In the event of death in an employee's immediate
family, the employee shall receive three days leave with pay following the date
of death, but not beyond a day after the funeral, provided that the employee
attends the funeral. Pay shall be eight hours at the employee's straight-time
for each day of leave. Immediate family is defined as the employee's spouse,
child, parent, brother, sister, stepchildren and current mother- in-law or
father-in-law. (For additional child bereavement leave, refer to subsection (f)
below.) The City may require a substantiation of death and the employee's
attendance at the funeral, if so requested. An employee shall receive two days
leave with pay under the terms of this subsection in the event of the death of
the employee's grandparent, spouse's grandparent, grandchildren, stepfather,
stepmother, brother-in-law or sister-in-law.
   (f)   Child Bereavement Leave. Pursuant to Public Act 099-0703, a City
employee is entitled to a maximum of two work weeks (ten work days) of unpaid
bereavement time following the death of a child. A City employee shall be
entitled to a maximum of six weeks of bereavement time in the event of the
death of more than one child during a twelve-month period.
   A City employee shall utilize this child bereavement leave only to attend
the funeral or alternative to a funeral of the child, to make arrangements
necessitated by the death of the child, or to grieve the death of the child.
The child bereavement leave shall be completed within sixty days after the date
that the City employee receives notice of the death of the child. The City
shall be entitled to forty-eight hours of notice before the commencement of the
child bereavement leave, unless such notice is not practicable. The City may
require documentation from the City employee to verify the necessity of the
bereavement leave.
   A City employee is eligible for the child bereavement leave after 1,250
hours of service with the City during the prior twelve month period. Child
bereavement leave shall not be taken in addition to unpaid leave permitted
under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.("FMLA"), and
shall not exceed unpaid leave time allowed under that law (FMLA).
   (g)   Executive Leave. All of the department head employees and many
management and professional employees are routinely required to attend meetings
or work on projects outside of the normal working hours of the City. In
recognition of the significant hours spent in the evenings and weekends, all
department head employees and those management employees designated by the City
Manager shall receive five days of executive leave each calendar year. This
time must be used on an annual basis or shall be forfeited. Any department head
hired after the start of the year shall have his or her executive leave
prorated in accordance with the hire date for the first year of employment.
Requests to use executive leave shall be submitted to the City Manager for
approval prior to use.

(1977 Code § 23-108)
290.13 MAINTENANCE OF THE CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PLANS.
   (a)   Responsibilities of the City Manager. The City Manager shall be

different classes of positions which are prescribed in this chapter shall be
changed only upon recommendation of the City Manager and amendment of this
chapter by Council. Such changes as required shall be made annually to become

Plan shall be made in a manner to maintain proper percentage relationships
among classes of positions, consistent with the availability of financial
resources and decisions made by the City concerning the allocation of its
financial resources.
   (c)   Employee Requests for Classification and Pay Adjustments. Any employee
shall have the right to the consideration of any request he or she may have
with respect to the application of the Classification and Compensation Plans to
his or her position. The employee shall initially make his or her request to
the department or office head, who shall promptly seek to arrive at a solution
which is consistent with the Plans and acceptable to the employee. Where the
department or office head is unable to resolve such a request in a manner that
the employee is willing to accept in writing, the matter shall then be
submitted to the City Manager for a solution which is consistent with the Plans
and acceptable to the employee. The decision of the City Manager shall be
final.

290.14 EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.
   (a)   It is the City's policy to encourage employees in self-development
activities which will increase their worth and contribution to the City. The
Educational Assistance Program is intended as a means of accomplishing such
objectives. All courses and total programs that are submitted for approval
should be judged by the above criteria.
   (b)   The City may pay less than 100 percent of tuition, laboratory fees and
textbook charges for a specific course, based upon the City's evaluation of the
course, available funds allocated to the educational systems program and the
City's allocation of its resources, provided that:
      (1)   The course is directly related to the employee's present work or
can reasonably be expected to contribute to the employee's future with the
City. In the case of employees participating in a registered degree program,
all courses required to complete the degree will be considered work-related.
      (2)   The employee is a permanent full-time employee with a good work
record and proven ability to perform his or her present duties.
      (3)   The course is offered by a degree-granting school, college or
university that is accredited by a recognized accreditation agency, and college
credit is given on successful completion.
      (4)   The course is offered by a school or junior college district in
preparation for obtaining a high school diploma by a G.E.D. test administered
by the district.
      (5)   Council has appropriated adequate funds in the annual budget to
provide for the proposed course under the Educational Assistance Program.
      (6)   The course expenditures have been approved in advance by the
employee's department head and the City Manager.
      (7)   The employee successfully completes the course with a "C" or better
grade.
   (c)   Specifically excluded from reimbursement under this policy are:
      (1)   The costs of supplies, activity fees, transportation, penalty fees
for late enrollment, special fees not included in the basic cost of the course
or other costs not required by the institution offering the course. (Laboratory
fees are considered as part of tuition.)
      (2)   Personnel enrolled in cooperative programs.
      (3)   Training programs of specific departments, occupations or trade or
professional organizations that consist of "short courses," seminars, on-the-
job training, etc.
      (4)   Part-time employees.
      (5)   Temporary employees.
      (6)   Terminating employees who voluntarily leave prior to completion of
the course or who involuntarily leave due to discharge for willful misconduct
or infraction of an ordinance or department rules.
      (7)   Any portion of costs connected with the course which are paid or
which are eligible for payment under any subsidy, grant or scholarship from a
governmental, educational, professional or charitable body, organization or
institution (i.e. G.I. Bill or scholarships).
   (d)   The payments provided for in this section are reimbursement payments.
The employee is expected to enroll for study on his or her own initiative and
pay the necessary costs out of his or her own personal funds. No reimbursement
is to be made until evidence of satisfactory completion of the course and
payment therefor is submitted and approved. Upon receipt of such evidence and
approval thereof, fifty percent of the total cost will be paid to the employee
immediately. The employee shall not be entitled to receive any further
reimbursement for such costs unless he or she remains in the employ of the City
for a period of one year continuously from the date of completion of the
course, at the end of which time he or she shall be paid the remaining fifty
percent.
   (e)   The City Manager or his or her designated representative shall
administer the Program and maintain the records. To obtain approval prior to
course registration:
      (1)   The employee will discuss the nature of the course and its job
relationship with his or her department head.
      (2)   If the department head and employee agree that the course is
appropriate, the employee will complete two copies of an educational assistance
request.
      (3)   The department head will forward the original and one copy of the
request bearing his or her approval to the City Manager for his or her
approval. The City Manager will forward the approved original to the Human
Resources Director and return the approved copy to the department head for his
or her files.
      (4)   The Human Resources Director will file the original according to
course completion date.
   (f)   To obtain a refund after completion of the course:

her designee will reimburse the employee his or her costs as covered by this
policy and report this action to the City Manager.

      (3)   The department head has determined that granting such time off will
not adversely affect the performance of the department.
      (4)   Employees will not be paid for such time off and must make up such
time off as scheduled by the department head.

same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (c)   In any case in which a Hearing Officer finds that a defendant has

violation, any expenses incurred by the municipality to enforce the judgment

failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time if the
petitioner establishes that the municipality did not provide proper service of
process.
   (f)   If any fine, penalty, and/or cost is owing and unpaid after a
determination of liability under this Chapter has become final and the
respondent has exhausted or failed to exhaust judicial procedures for review,
the Director of Administrative Hearings shall cause a notice of final
determination of liability to be sent to the respondent.
   (g)   If respondent fails to pay such fine or penalty within fourteen (14)
days after the notice of final determination of liability, the City of Freeport

law: Decline to issue or renew any license, permit, zoning variance, or other
permission required and applied for by respondent under the City Code, until
respondent pays such fine or penalty.
   (h)   When the Director of Administrative Hearings becomes aware that a
respondent has failed to pay such fine or penalty within the prescribed

permit, or for a renewal of such license or permit, the department that is
responsible for issuing the license or permit shall notify the respondent that

the outstanding debt. The notice shall inform the respondent that he or she may
request a description of the outstanding debt from the City Ordinance

date of notice to appeal the department's denial by requesting a hearing by the
City Manager or his designee.
   (k)   Requests for hearing shall be made in writing to the City Manager’s
Office. A request for hearing shall include: the full name, address and
telephone number of the respondent, a written statement signed by the
respondent setting forth facts, law or other information relevant to
establishing a defense to the department's denial; a copy of the notice
provided to the respondent by the license/permit issuing department under
subsection (j): and, any documentary evidence that supports the respondent's
appeal, including receipts for the payment of an alleged debt. Upon receipt of
a timely and proper request for a hearing, the City Manager, or his or her
designee shall assign a hearing date no later than fifteen (15) business days
after the date of request. The hearing shall not be continued without the
consent of the respondent. The City Manager, or his or her designee, shall
determine whether or not the respondent is ineligible for a license/permit
pursuant to this section. The hearing shall comply with the following
provisions:
      (1)   The City Manager, or his or her designee, shall abide by any prior
determination that a debt exists and the scope of review shall be limited to
whether the debt has been satisfied and whether the determination that a debt
exists was issued against the respondent. The petitioner shall not be entitled
to raise any defenses related to his or her liability for the underlying debt.
      (2)   The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in the
conduct of the hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it
is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct
of their affairs.
      (3)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the City Manager or his or her
designee shall issue a final order that the respondent is either eligible or
ineligible for issuance or renewal of the license/permit. If the respondent is
found to be ineligible, the petitioner's license/permit may not be issued or
renewed prior to the payment of the outstanding debt. The City Manager, or his
designee, shall issue a final order no more than fifteen (15) business days
after the conclusion of the hearing.
   (l)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (g) herein, the City may
issue an initial or renewal license or permit to a respondent if the Director
of the issuing department or other appropriate City department or agency
determines that:
      (1)   The respondent has entered into an agreement with a court of
competent jurisdiction, the Department of Finance, or other appropriate City
department or agency, for the payment of all debts owed and the respondent is
in compliance with the agreement; or
      (2)   The respondent is contesting liability for or the amount of the
debt in a pending administrative or judicial proceeding, or
      (3)   The respondent has filed a petition in bankruptcy and the debts
owed are dischargeable in bankruptcy.
   (m)   When the holder of a license or permit is notified in accordance with
subsection (i) that such license or permit will not be renewed unless an
outstanding judgment is paid, the license or permit shall remain in effect
during the pendency of the appeal process described in subsection (k). When a
license or permit is found to be ineligible for renewal through the appeal
process, it shall expire at such time as the license or permit holder has
exhausted or failed to exhaust the appeal procedures described in subsection
(j).

   (a)   Parking Privileges; Exemptions. A motor vehicle bearing a registration
plate, special decal or device issued by the State or any other jurisdiction
designating that the vehicle is operated by or for a disabled person or
veteran, and which is being operated by or for a disabled person or veteran,
shall be exempt from any State statute or local ordinance imposing time
limitations on parking, except limitations of one-half hour or less, on any
City street or highway and on any City-owned or leased parking lot or parking
place. Any motor vehicle bearing any such registration plate, decal or device
which is being operated by or for a disabled person or veteran may be parked,
in addition to any other lawful place, in any parking place specifically
reserved for such vehicles by the posting of a sign. Parking privileges granted
as provided in this section are strictly limited to the persons to whom the
special registration plates, special decals or devices are issued and to
qualified operators acting under the express direction and in the presence of
the disabled person or veteran. Such parking privileges granted by this
subsection are also extended to motor vehicles of not-for-profit organizations
used for the transportation of disabled persons and/or veterans when any such
motor vehicle displays any such registration plate, special decal or device and
when such motor vehicle is being used for the transportation of one or more
disabled persons and/or veterans. This subsection shall not permit the parking
of any motor vehicle in violation of the provisions of Section 480.03. This
subsection shall not permit the parking of any motor vehicle in violation of an
official sign expressly prohibiting parking at any time or during certain hours
in the area controlled by the sign. When using the parking privileges for
persons with disabilities, the parking decal or device must be displayed
properly in the vehicle where it is clearly visible to law enforcement
personnel, either hanging from the rearview mirror or placed on the dashboard
of the vehicle in clear view.
   (b)   Unauthorized Use of Reserved Parking Places. No person shall park any
motor vehicle in any parking place, including any private or public off-street
parking facility, specifically reserved, by the posting of a sign, for a
disabled person or veteran, or a motor vehicle bearing a registration plate,
decal or device designating that the vehicle is operated by or for a disabled
person and/or veteran, unless the parked motor vehicle is operated by a
disabled person or veteran or by a qualified operator acting under the express
direction, and in the presence of, a disabled person or veteran. The owner of a
privately-owned parking place in which a motor vehicle is parked in violation
of this subsection, after notifying the police, may remove it or cause it to be
removed to the nearest garage or other place of safety, and the police may
remove or cause to be removed any motor vehicle parked in any City-owned
parking place in violation of this subsection to the nearest garage or other
place of safety.
   (c)   Officers Authorized to Remove Vehicles. Whenever any police officer
finds a vehicle parked in violation of any of the provisions of this section,
such officer is hereby authorized to move such vehicle, or require the driver
or other person in charge of the vehicle to move the same, to a position off
the roadway where it may be lawfully parked. This provision shall not limit the

to a charge under this section that either the sign posted pursuant to this
section or the intended accessible parking place does not comply with the
technical requirements of this section if a reasonable person would be made
aware by the sign or notice on or near the parking place that the place is
reserved for a person with disabilities. In addition to those spaces required
pursuant to the above, parking spaces shall be designated as follows:

   (a)   A dangerous dog means any dog which approaches any person in an
apparent attitude of attack either upon public or private property, or
approaches any domesticated animal in an apparent attitude of attack off the
property of the owner or keeper of the dog. A dog is considered to be found
dangerous, and subject to the provisions of this section, under the following
circumstances:
      (1)   The circuit court has found the dog to be a dangerous dog as
defined herein and has entered an order based on that finding; or
      (2)   A duly appointed hearing officer for the City of Freeport has found
the dog to be a dangerous dog as defined herein and has entered an order based
on that finding; or
      (3)   A finding is made in accordance with the following procedure:
         A.    An Animal Control Officer, or any adult person may request,
under oath, that a dog be classified as a dangerous dog by submitting a sworn,
written complaint on a form approved by the Animal Control Officer. Upon
receipt of such complaint, the following persons can conduct an investigation:
the Stephenson County Animal Control Administrator (the "Administrator"), or
his or her duly authorized representative, a City or County Animal Control
Officer or Warden or a law enforcement officer. The owner of the dog shall be
notified that a complaint has been filed and that an investigation into the
allegations as set forth in the complaint will be conducted.

impounded and Section
612.05(b) is complied with, release the dog to the owner after the owner has
paid all fees incurred for the impoundment. If all impoundment fees have not
been paid within ten business days after a final determination that a dog is
dangerous, the official may cause the dog to be humanely destroyed.
      (4)   Notice. Within five days after declaring a dog dangerous, the
official shall notify the owner of the dog's designation as a dangerous dog,
and of the requirements and conditions for keeping the dog, as set forth
herein. The notice shall inform the dog owner that he may request, in writing,
a hearing to contest the finding and designation within five business days
after delivery of the dangerous dog designation notice. Failure of the dog
owner to request a hearing shall result in the dog being finally declared a
dangerous dog and shall subject the dog and its owner to the provisions of this
section.
      (5)   Appeal. A hearing shall be set within fifteen days after receiving
the dog owner's timely written request for such a hearing. The Animal Control
Officer shall provide notice of the date, time and location of the hearing to
the dog owner and to the complainant by regular mail. At the hearing, all
interested persons shall be given the opportunity to present evidence on the

         D.   Observable behavior of the dog;
         E.   Site and circumstances of the incident; and
         F.   Statements from interested parties.
      (6)   If the official determines that a dog is dangerous at the
conclusion of a hearing conducted hereunder, that decision shall be final
unless the dog owner appeals to a court of competent jurisdiction for any
remedies that may be available within ten days after receiving notice that the
dog has been finally declared dangerous.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which
has been found to be a dangerous dog unless the person meets the following
requirements:
      (1)   Registration of dangerous dogs. The owner shall register a
dangerous dog within ten days of the dog being declared dangerous. The dog must
be registered by April 1 of each year thereafter. The dog shall be registered

owner.

that the dog is dangerous, such dog must be spayed or neutered, if the dog is
six months of age or older, and if not, then within ten business days of dog
attaining such age.

owner when not under control by leash and muzzled or within and enclosed

(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.03 WRITTEN NOTICE; COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   Before filing a complaint under Section
620.04, the Corporation Counsel shall, by personal service or by certified
mail, provide to the owner of the place at which the nuisance is located, or
the agent of the owner, written notice of the following:
      (1)   That a nuisance, as defined in this chapter, exists at the place
specified in the notice;
      (2)   That the owner of the place or his or her agent has fourteen days
from the mailing of the notice or seven days from personal service of the
notice, to appear at the Corporation Counsel's office, at the address provided
in the notice, to arrange to take action or abate the nuisance; and
      (3)   That failure to appear at the Corporation Counsel's office within
the time indicated may result in the Corporation Counsel filing a complaint to
enjoin the use of the owner's property for a period of one year.
   (b)   If the owner of the place or his or her agent does not appear at the
Corporation Counsel's office as requested within the time periods prescribed
above, the Corporation Counsel may file a complaint under Section
620.04. If the owner or his or her agent appears before the Corporation Counsel

by the Corporation Counsel. If the owner or his or her agent does not
affirmatively agree to follow the Corporation Counsel's recommendations, the

under Section

not result in irreparable harm, loss or damage, the Corporation Counsel shall,
before filing the complaint, provide the owner of the place or his or her
agent, by personal service or by certified mail sent to the last known address
of such owner or agent, with written notification of the requested
recommendations and notice of intent to file a suit under Section

(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.04 PROCEDURES FOR FILING A COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTION.
   (a)   A complaint may be filed by the Corporation Counsel to enjoin all
persons from maintaining or permitting such nuisance, to abate the same and to
enjoin the use of any such place for a period of one year.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint which states that irreparable injury,
loss or damage will result to the people of the City of Freeport, the court
shall enter a temporary restraining order, without notice, enjoining the
maintenance of such nuisance, upon testimony under oath, an affidavit or a
verified complaint containing facts sufficient, if sustained, to justify the
court in entering a preliminary injunction upon a hearing after notice. Every
such temporary restraining order entered without notice shall be endorsed with
the date and hour of entry of the order, shall be filed of record and shall
expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed ten days, as is
fixed by the court. The temporary restraining order may be extended for good
cause or with the consent of the party against whom the order is directed. The
reason for an extension shall be shown in the order.
   (c)   In case a temporary restraining order is entered without notice, the
motion for a permanent injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest
possible time and shall take precedence over all matters except older matters
of the same character. When the motion comes on for hearing, the Corporation
Counsel shall proceed with the application for a permanent injunction. Upon two
days notice to the Corporation Counsel, the defendant may appear and move for
the dissolution or modification of the temporary restraining order. In that
event, the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as
expeditiously as the ends of justice require.
(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.05 EVIDENCE.
   The defendant shall be held to answer the allegations of the complaint as in
other civil proceedings. At all hearings upon the merits of a complaint,
evidence of the general reputation of the place, of the residents thereof and
of those resorting thereto, shall be admissible for the purpose of proving the
existence of the nuisance.
(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.06 INTERROGATORIES; REFUSAL TO ANSWER; CONTEMPT.
   The plaintiff may, with leave of the court, file interrogatories in writing
concerning matters material to the allegations of the complaint or with respect
to the ownership of the property upon which it is claimed the nuisance is
maintained. A full answer to each interrogatory under oath by the defendant
shall be filed with the Clerk within ten days after a copy of the
interrogatories has been served upon him or her. For failure to so answer
interrogatories, the court may strike the answer to the complaint from the
files and enter an order of default and final judgment. A rule to answer
interrogatories may be entered and the court may punish a defendant for
contempt of court for refusal to obey such rule. No person shall be excused
from answering interrogatories under oath on the grounds that an answer may
tend to incriminate him or her or subject him or her to a penalty or
forfeiture. The answer shall be evidence against, but not on behalf of, the
defendant. Evidence derived from the answer shall not be used against the
defendant in any criminal proceeding other than as rebuttal evidence to
testimony given by the defendant, or in a case for perjury.
(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.07 JUDGMENT.
   If the existence of a nuisance is established, the court shall enter a
judgment restraining all persons from maintaining or permitting such nuisance
and from using the place in which the same is maintained for any purpose,
except a purpose that the court designates, for a period of one year
thereafter, and restraining the defendant from maintaining any such nuisance
within the jurisdiction of the court. No injunction shall be entered against an
owner, nor shall an order be entered that any place be closed or kept closed,
if it appears that the owner or his or her agent has in good faith endeavored
to prevent the nuisance or did not have knowledge of the nuisance. An owner or
agent who has complied with the recommendations requested by the Corporation
Counsel under Section
620.04 shall be deemed to have endeavored in good faith to prevent the
nuisance. While the judgment remains in effect, such place shall be in the
custody of the court. In the event that the court orders such place be closed
or kept closed, the court shall allow a reasonable fee to be taxed as part of
the costs.
(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.08 PROSECUTION FOR VIOLATION OF INJUNCTION OR ABATEMENT ORDER.
   In case of a violation of any injunction issued under the provisions of this
chapter, the court may summarily try and punish the offender for his or her
contempt of court.
(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.09 RELEASE OF PREMISES.
   (a)   If the owner of the place has not been guilty of any contempt of court
in the proceedings, and appears and pays all costs, fees and allowances that
are a lien on the place and files a bond in the full value of the property, to
be ascertained by the court, with sureties, to be approved by the court
conditioned that he or she will immediately abate any such nuisance that may
exist at the place and prevent it from being established or kept therein within
a period of one year thereafter, the court may, if satisfied of good faith,
order the place to be delivered to the owner.
   (b)   The release of such place under the provisions of this chapter does
not release it from any judgment, lien or liability to which it may be subject.
(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.10 FINE AND COSTS TO BE LIEN AGAINST PROPERTY.
   Whenever a fine or costs are assessed under the provisions of this chapter
against the owner of any property herein declared to be a nuisance, such fine
or costs shall constitute a lien upon such property to the extent of the
interest of such owner, and an order of execution shall issue thereon.
(Ord. 95-4. Passed 9-18-95.)
620.11 LEASED PREMISES; PRESUMPTION; FORCIBLE ENTRY AND DETAINER ACTION AND
OTHER RELIEF.
   (a)   Presumption of Use or Possession. If a controlled substance is found
or used anywhere in the premises of an apartment, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the controlled substance was either used or possessed by a
lessee or occupant, or that a lessee or occupant permitted the premises to be
used for that use or possession.
   (b)   Voiding of Lease; Five-Day Notice to Vacate. If any lessee or occupant
uses a leased premises for the purpose of unlawfully possessing, serving,
storing, manufacturing, cultivating, delivering, using, selling or giving away
controlled substances, or permits such premises to be used for any such
purposes, the lease or contract for letting such premises shall, at the option
of the lessor, become void. The lessor may notify the lessee or occupant that
the lease or contract for letting such premises is void by written notice to
vacate and by posting a written notice at the premises requiring the lessee or
occupant to vacate the leased premises on or before a date five days after the
giving of the notice. The notice shall state the basis for its issuance on
forms provided by the Circuit Court Clerk of Stephenson County. The lessor may
have a like remedy to recover possession against a tenant holding over after
the expiration of his or her lease term.
   (c)   Right of Forcible Entry and Detainer.
      (1)   If an owner or lessor voids a lease or contract for letting under
the provisions of this chapter, and a tenant or occupant has not vacated the
premises within five days after receipt of a written notice to vacate such
premises, the owner or lessor may bring a forcible entry and detainer action
against the lessee and all occupants of the leased premises pursuant to Article
IX of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Illinois Forcible Entry and Detainer Act
(735 ILCS 5/9-101 et seq.).
      (2)   Notwithstanding Sections 9-112, 9-113 and 9-114 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, a judgment for costs against the plaintiff owner/lessor
seeking possession of the premises under this subsection shall not be awarded
to the defendant lessee/occupant unless the action was brought by the plaintiff
owner/lessor in bad faith. An action to possess a premises under this chapter
shall not be deemed to be in bad faith where the plaintiff owner/lessor based
his or her cause of action on information provided to him or her by a law
enforcement agency.
   (d)   Effect of Chapter on Lease or Contract. Any provision of a lease or
contract for letting which is more restrictive than this chapter, or which
provides greater remedies to the owner/lessor, shall prevail; and no provision
of this chapter shall limit an owner/lessor in enforcing said contract terms.

before furnishing cannabis or cannabis products to a person under twenty-one
years of age, adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person. This

municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not
limited to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate
issued under the Military Selective Service Act, or an identification card

County for the purpose of authorizing the County to license the sale of raffle
chances within the City limits pursuant to the County ordinance governing the
licensing of raffles. The City has entered into a written intergovernmental
agreement with the County for the foregoing purpose. Raffle chances sold within
the City shall be permitted and shall be legal when done pursuant to a license

659.03 REMEDIES; EFFECT OF DETERMINATION.
   (a)   In the event a property is determined to be a chronic nuisance
property through an administrative order entered under this chapter, the
property shall be thereafter deemed a nuisance as said term is used in all
other sections of this Code. In addition to remedies provided for nuisances

specifically available to the City after the determination a property is a
chronic nuisance pursuant to this chapter, without further action:
      (1)   The City may elect to mitigate any nuisances existing upon the
property, whether or not such conditions gave rise to the determination of a
chronic nuisance. In proceeding with mitigation, City personnel or their agents
may enter onto any portion of the property not occupied as a residence, without
notice at any time and conduct such activities as are reasonably necessary to
correct a nuisance. Such activities may include, but are not limited to,
mowing, removing trash or garbage, removing inoperable vehicles, or demolishing
accessory structures.
      (2)   In the event the property is occupied by a person other than the
owner of record of the property, the City may order the property closed and
secured against all use for a period of up to 180 days. If the City elects such
a remedy, the City shall notify all parties entitled to notice under Section
659.06, in the manner provided in that section, no less than 30 days prior to
securing the property.
      (3)   Any such other and further remedies deemed appropriate by the
Hearing Officer, within his or her discretion, as specifically reflected in the
order. Provided, that if any injunctive relief is sought or awarded, personal
service of the notice required in Section
659.05(b) shall be required, and personal service shall be made of any written
order directing any person to take a particular action or refrain from any
particular activity.
   (b)   In addition to the remedies provided in subsection (a) hereof, there
shall be imposed upon the owner of the property a civil penalty in the amount
of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day, payable to the City, for each day a
property is permitted to remain a chronic nuisance property. The fines imposed
hereby shall accrue commencing on the date of entry of an order declaring a
property a chronic nuisance property pursuant to Section
659.06 through such date as the Director determines that the conditions giving
rise to the finding of a chronic nuisance have been abated or repaired. If the
Director does not make such a finding upon request of the owner, the owner may
appeal the decision of the Director by filing a request for appeal with the
Director at any time. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Director shall set the
matter for hearing before the Hearing Officer at the next available hearing
date for the administrative court which occurs not less than seven calendar
days after the date the appeal is received.
   (c)   Any amounts expended by the City to mitigate any conditions or secure
a property under subsection (a) hereof, and all fines accrued pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof, shall be assessed against the owner as a part of the
judgment amount, and shall further constitute a lien against the property until
paid. The City may file a notice of lien against the property for any such
costs and fees, and shall provide a copy thereof to the owner within three
business days of filing any such lien.

   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 659.04 was repealed by Ordinance 2020-44, passed
September 8, 2020.)
659.05 PROCEDURE.
   When the Director receives two or more police reports or ordinance violation
reports documenting the occurrence of nuisance activity on or within a
property, the Director shall independently review such reports to determine
whether they describe acts in violation of this chapter. Upon such findings,
the Director may:
   (a)   Notify the owner, in writing, that the property is in danger of being
declared a chronic nuisance. The notice shall contain, at a minimum, the
following information:
      (1)   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
      (2)   A statement that the Director has information that the property may
be chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the nuisance
activities that have been documented. The Director shall offer the owner an
opportunity to propose a course of action that the Director agrees will abate
the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation.
      (3)   A concise list of remedies and penalties available to the City
should the property be declared a chronic nuisance property.
   (b)   After complying with the notification procedures described in
subsection (a), when the Director receives a police report or an ordinance
violation report documenting the occurrence of a subsequent nuisance activity
at or within a property during any six-month period and determines that the
property has become a chronic nuisance property, the Director shall:
      (1)   Notify the owner in writing that the property has been determined
to be a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain, at a minimum, the
following information:
         A.   The street address or legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
         B.   A statement that the Director has determined the property to be
chronic nuisance property with a concise description of the nuisance activities
leading to his or her findings.
         C.   Demand that the owner respond within ten days to the Director and
propose a course of action that the Director agrees will abate the nuisance
activities giving rise to the violation.
         D.   Service shall be made either personally or by certified mail,
postage pre-paid, return receipt requested, addressed to the owner at the
address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such
other place which is likely to give the owner notice of the determination by
the Director.
         E.   A copy of the notice shall also be served on the owner at such
address as shown on the rolls of the Stephenson County Assessor, and/or the
occupant, if known, at the address of the property, if the occupant is not the
owner, and shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage pre-
paid.
         F.   A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after
ten days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice if the owner has
not contacted the Director in accordance with subsection C. hereof.
         G.   The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may
be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
proceedings under this chapter, so long as notice has been mailed to the
persons specified and in the manner set forth in this section,
      (2)   If prior to a determination that a property is a chronic nuisance
pursuant to this chapter, the owner stipulates in writing with the Director
that the owner will pursue a course of action the parties agree will abate the
nuisance activities giving rise to the violations, the Director may agree to
delay or continue proceedings for not more than 30 days. If the agreed course
of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activity within said
30-day period, the Director shall proceed with the administrative adjudication
process.
   (c)   When an owner makes a response to the Director as required above, any
conduct or statements made in connection with the furnishing of that response
shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance activities have or are
occurring. This subsection does not require the exclusion of any evidence which
is otherwise admissible or offered for any other purpose.
(Ord. 2005-66. Passed 12-5-05; Ord. 2012-24. Passed 4-16-12; Ord. 2017-56.
Passed 7-17-17; Ord. 2020-44. Passed 9-8-20.)
659.06 COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION, BURDEN OF PROOF.
   After the City has complied with the notice and procedures in Section
659.05, if the Director believes the conditions giving rise to the violations
have not been adequately remedied, the Director may institute an action through
the administrative adjudication process set forth in
Chapter 299 of these Codified Ordinances requesting a finding that the property
constitutes a chronic nuisance property. Notice of any scheduled hearing shall
be provided to the same persons, and in the same manner, as required of the
notice required by Section
659.05 hereof.
   (a)   In an action seeking a finding that a property is a chronic nuisance
property, the City shall have the initial burden of showing by preponderance of
the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. Provided, there
shall be a rebuttable presumption that a property is a chronic nuisance
property if three or more violations of any of the provisions of State statute
or these Codified Ordinances set forth in Section
659.02 have been determined to exist on three distinct occasions through a
determination of the City’s Administrative Hearing Officer or by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   (b)   It is a defense to an action seeking a finding that a property is a
chronic nuisance property that the conditions giving rise to the violations

free access by members of the public, officers, employees, occupants or any
other persons. No person shall, by his or her presence or by his or her

the conduct of business in such stores or shops or in the offices located in

and curbings or on any such improvement which is not specifically provided for
or intended for such purpose or use in any public place, including public
plazas and shopping malls such as the Stephenson Street Shopping Mall between
State Avenue and Van Buren Avenue. A person commits a violation if he or she,
singly or with others, loiters or prowls in a place, at a time or in a manner
not usual for law abiding individuals, under circumstances that warrant alarm
for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the circumstances
which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the
fact that the actor takes flight upon appearance of a police officer, refuses
to identify himself or herself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or
herself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other circumstances make
it impracticable, a police officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense
under this section, afford the actor the opportunity to dispel any alarm which
would otherwise be warranted by requesting him or her to identify himself or
herself and explain his or her presence and conduct. No person shall be
convicted of an offense under this section if the police officer did not comply
with the preceding sentence, or if it appears that the explanation given by the
actor was true and, if believed by the police officer at the time, would have
dispelled the alarm. This section shall not be construed to prohibit innocent
public assembly or political, religious or civil demonstrations, gatherings or
activities, but rather to prohibit conduct calculated to do harm to the persons
or property of others and to the rights and freedom of others.

   (g)   Summary Action; Hearing.
      (1)   When the conduct of any licensee, agent or employee is so inimical
to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare as to constitute a
nuisance and thus give rise to an emergency, the License Officer may summarily
order the cessation of business and either close the premises or suspend or
revoke the license.
      (2)   Unless waived in writing, within three days after he or she has
acted summarily, the License Officer shall conduct a special hearing with

later than the mandated closing time for liquor establishments the morning of
the following calendar day, shall be deemed a single event for purposes of this
paragraph.
            Records of events and required documentation shall be kept by the
licensee for no less than three years, and shall be produced to the City within
seven days of any request by the Liquor Commissioner for said records.
            No sales of alcoholic beverages of any kind may be made upon any
premises licensed as a BYOB establishment, except where said sales are made
pursuant to a valid Temporary Permit issued by the Liquor Commission pursuant
to the provisions of Section 806.03A, or where said sales are made by the
holder of a validly issued Class CR license. For purposes of this Section,
"sales" shall include the provision of alcoholic beverages as part of a package
rental arrangement, and providing liquor to persons in exchange for tips or
gratuities. Provided, that under no circumstances may a BYOB licensee be
allowed to make sales of alcoholic beverages on its own premises at any time,

806.03A TEMPORARY LICENSES.
   Temporary licenses authorizing the sale of alcoholic liquors at a location,
or by a person, not otherwise authorized or licensed, may be obtained pursuant
to the provisions of this section and in accordance with the rules and

Chapter 802, the provisions of this section shall supercede those of
Chapter 802. The application required shall, at a minimum, include and/or be
supported by documents or sworn statements as follows:
         A.   The name of the applicant, address for which the license is
sought;
         B.   The dates and times the license is to be effective;

      (2)   The hours and location for which any temporary license is in effect
shall be deemed a special event as defined in
Chapter 1030 of these Codified Ordinances, shall specifically be deemed an
"assembly" for purposes of that chapter, and shall be subject to the approval
requirements of that chapter. Application shall be made for a special event at
the same time as application is made for the temporary license hereunder, and
failure to obtain the special event permit prior to the effective date of the
temporary license shall void said temporary license. The Clerk may, but need
not, establish a combined form for application which satisfies the requirements
of both this section and
Chapter 1030. Upon payment of the fee for the temporary license, the special

year.
      (5)   The licensed premises for purposes of any temporary license issued
hereunder shall be the location, or any specified portion thereof, which has
been approved by the Liquor Commission.
      (6)   A temporary license issued hereunder shall not permit any person to
serve or sell any type of alcoholic liquor unless such sales are permitted by
such licensee under its license granted pursuant to Section
806.03 hereof, or similar provision of a foreign jurisdiction which issued a
license for retail sales of alcoholic liquor (the "primary license"). Except as
provided in relation to T-4 licenses, no person shall sell any package liquor
for consumption off-premises pursuant to a temporary license unless otherwise
permitted under its primary license or an associated supplemental license.
   (b)   Types of Temporary Licenses.
      (1)   A Class T-1 Temporary License shall authorize the sale of alcoholic

twenty-one years.
            3.   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any person
bearing a wristband, who is found to be under the age of twenty-one, was issued

any location, including but not limited to on any public right-of-way.
Provided, however, that in the event that a Festival District has been declared
pursuant to Section
806.22 of these Codified Ordinances, the restriction on removal of alcoholic
liquor from a participating location shall not be prohibited so long as the
sponsor ensures that all participating locations comply with the
responsibilities of licensees under Sections
806.22(e)(2) and
806.22(e)(6).
            8.   Only alcoholic liquors purchased and distributed by the
sponsor or tasting representatives of an authorized distributor may be served

shall be collected by the sponsor and disposed of.

nature, including costs and attorneys' fees, in any way resulting from or
arising out of the tasting walk.

806.04 SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSES.
   Holders of a license issued pursuant to this chapter (herein referred to as
the "primary license") may be eligible for supplemental licenses as set forth
in this section, pursuant to approval by the Commission and payment of the
requisite fee as from time to time established.
   (a)   Application for any supplemental license shall be made to the City
Clerk, on forms provided for such purpose, and may be made at any time. The
grant of a supplemental license shall be at the discretion of the Liquor
Commission, pursuant to the same procedures as for a primary license. A
supplemental license shall renew with, and according to the same process as,
the primary license.
   (b)   The award of any supplemental license shall be indicated by an
endorsement on the face of the primary license.
   (c)   The award of any supplemental license shall not affect the types of
alcoholic liquor allowed to be sold at retail by any licensee pursuant to the
primary license.
   (d)   The following supplemental licenses shall be available to holders in
good standing of a primary license issued by the City of the following
classifications: Class A, Class K, Class R, Class LR, Class M, and Class W.
      (1)   Supplemental package sales. A supplemental license for the sale of
alcoholic liquor for consumption off of the licensed premises may be awarded to
a person who is the holder in good standing of a Class A, R, LR, M, or W
License. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section
806.04(c), the holder of an LR or W License may be issued a supplemental
package sales license for the package sale of any kind of alcoholic liquor,
provided:
         A.   A Class W licensee shall pay an additional one-time fee at the
time of initial issuance of the supplemental package sales license equal to the
difference between the current issuance fee for a Tier I and a Tier II license,
if applicable; and
         B.   Any package sales of alcoholic liquor other than wine and beer
shall be made from displays which are not accessible to the public and only
accessible to employees of the licensee.
      (2)   Supplemental video gaming. A supplemental license for the operation
of video gaming devices may be granted to a person who is the holder in good
standing of a Class R or LR License. In addition to the standard requirements
for issuance and maintenance of a license hereunder, any licensee applying for
a supplemental video gaming license shall further be required to comply at all
times with the following provisions:
         A.   A restaurant shall be operated on the licensed premises at all
hours during which video gaming is available to the public.
         B.   The licensed premises shall have a minimum seating capacity of
twenty persons, with seating available for each person at least up to said
capacity, and not including any seating offered in the area reserved for video
gaming. The portion of the licensed premises reserved for dining shall be a
clearly-defined contiguous space, exclusively reserved for food and beverage
services, and shall provide a minimum of ten square feet per seat offered to
customers.
         C.   No more than fifty percent of the gross revenue to any licensee
having a supplemental video gaming license shall be derived from gaming
revenues. The gross revenues from sales of food, and beverages (including but
not limited to alcoholic liquor) by a licensee must be greater than the
licensee's revenues derived from video gaming during the same period, as
determined by reports from the Illinois Gaming Board for at least three of the
last five years on record. If a licensee has been in business less than five
years, a showing that the licensee has met the requirements of this section in
no less than fifty percent of the years for which data is available shall
suffice for purposes hereof. Failure to meet the requirements of this section
in the first full year of operation shall be grounds for disqualification for a
supplemental video gaming license in succeeding years, unless a good faith
showing of an attempt to comply with this section can be made by the licensee.
A certification of compliance with this section, signed by the licensee's
accountant, shall accompany any renewal application by any licensee holding a
supplemental video gaming license. If the certification is provided by a
certified public accountant, it shall be deemed valid. In all other events, the
Liquor Commission reserves the right to request any such further verification
of the accounts provided as it deems necessary, including, but not limited to,
an independent evaluation conducted by a certified public accountant, at the
licensees sole expense, as a prerequisite for issuance of a supplemental video
games license for the following year.
         D.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
following establishments are exempt from the requirements set forth in
paragraphs (d)(2)A. through C. hereof, and shall need only comply with the
general licensing requirements required under this Code, regardless of their
license classification:
            1.   Holders of existing City "A-V" or "W-V" licenses as of the
date of adoption hereof; and
            2.   Licenses which were holders of a liquor license validly issued
by Stephenson County as of the date of annexation of their property by
Ordinance 2019-29 adopted by the City of Freeport on May 20, 2019.
      (3)   Supplemental outdoor sales. A supplemental license for outdoor
sales and service of alcoholic liquor may be granted to a person who is the
holder in good standing of a Class A, K, R, LR, M, or W License. If a
supplemental license is awarded by the Liquor Commission under this subsection,
the licensed premises of the licensee shall be deemed expanded to include the
area in which outdoor sales have been approved while such area is in fact in
use. In addition to the standard requirements for issuance and maintenance of a
license hereunder, a licensee applying for a supplemental outdoor sales license
shall further be required to comply at all times with the following provisions:
         A.   The area in which outdoor sales or service are to occur must be
contiguous to, and accessible from, the building which is the licensed premises
for purposes of the primary license. Said building shall be referred to herein
as the "primary structure".
         B.   Access to the area in which outdoor sales or service occur shall
either be:
            1.   Exclusively by means of passing through the primary structure;
or
            2.   Through an access point which is within an unobstructed line
of sight from the area in which outdoor sales of alcoholic liquor are
occurring; or
            3.   As otherwise specified in relation to any sidewalk café or
parklet permit.
         C.   The area in which outdoor sales or service are to occur must be
delineated by a clear and unambiguous physical barrier in a form approved by
the Chief of Police and the Fire Chief. If said barrier is to be of a temporary
or semi-permanent nature, the barrier shall be in place and intact at all times
when outdoor sales are occurring.
         D.   No outdoor sales or service of alcoholic liquor shall be allowed
after 10:00 p.m. on any Sunday through Thursday, inclusive, or after 11:00 p.m.
on any Friday or Saturday.
         E.   No smoking shall be allowed in the designated area, or within
fifteen feet thereof.
         F.   No outdoor sales of packaged goods shall be allowed.
         G.   Any holder of a sidewalk cafe permit or parklet permit issued
under
Chapter 1026 or
Chapter 1034 of these Codified Ordinances shall be required to comply with the
provisions of those chapters, as well as the specific provisions of any issued
permit in relation to the sales of alcoholic liquors.
         H.   Any area which is included in the expanded licensed premises
shall be deemed "floor area" for, and additional seating capacity shall be
counted towards, determining off-street parking requirements under
Chapter 1262 of these Codified Ordinances. To the extent any parking area is
utilized for outdoor sales, it shall not be deemed available for parking
spaces.
      (4)   Supplemental golf course. A supplemental license for the sale and
service of alcoholic liquors in connection with the operation of a golf course
within the City limits may be issued pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection.
         A.   For purposes of this subsection, a golf course shall be defined
as an outdoor area consisting of not less than thirty five acres, and at least
nine separately playable holes with individual greens, and which is devoted
primarily to the traditional game of golf. The term "golf course" shall not be
deemed to refer to "miniature golf" courses consisting of man-made obstacles,
frisbee or disc golf courses, or any other game or amusement not substantially
observing the style of play contemplated by the United States Golf Association
in its most recently established set of rules.
         B.   A supplemental golf course license shall, in addition to the
other classes eligible for a supplemental license, be available to holders in
good standing of a Class M License.
         C.   A supplemental golf course license shall allow a Licensee to
engage in the retail sale of alcoholic beverages, either in prepared drinks or
in the original packaging, for consumption on the premises of the golf course
area, including the sale of alcoholic beverages from outdoor bar areas or from
golf carts or similar vehicles operated on the premises by the Licensee.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsection C, there shall be no sale or
consumption of alcoholic beverages:
            1.   In any driveway or parking lot areas where motor vehicles are
authorized or permitted to drive; or,
            2.   Within fifteen feet of the exterior lot line of the premises.
         E.   Licensee shall provide, at the time of application for a
supplemental license issued under this subsection, a site plan for the golf
course area, detailing the areas where sale and consumption are and are not
permitted, for review and approval by the Liquor Commission. The Liquor
Commission reserves the right to impose additional restrictions on the location
of sales.
         F.   Any person driving a beer/beverage/snack cart on a golf course or
otherwise delivering, giving or selling any alcohol, must be 21 years of age or
older and properly BASSET certified. At all times the driver of the cart must
be able to identify themselves and show proof of the date of birth and proof of
BASSET certification.
         G.   Any licensee holding a Supplemental Golf Course license shall not
be required to obtain a separate supplemental outdoor license under Section
806.04(d)(2) in order to authorize outdoor sales on a patio area or other
location contained within the same zoning parcel. All outdoor areas specified
in in the site plan for service of alcohol, as approved, shall be deemed part
of the Licensed Premises of Licensee. Provided, nothing herein shall be deemed
to modify any rules regarding requirements of special uses for the sale of
alcoholic liquors or outdoor service of food which may be imposed by the Zoning
Code as set forth elsewhere in these Codified Ordinances.
   (e)   Any violations of the requirements set forth in this section with
respect to a supplemental license shall be deemed a violation of the primary
license for all purposes of this chapter.
   (f)   Nothing contained herein, nor any approval granted by the Liquor
Commission pursuant to this section shall be deemed to relieve any person of
its obligation to comply with all relevant zoning and building codes applicable
to a location or structure.

member of an interest in a licensed business. "Immediate family member", for

and retain in, on, over, under, across and along any public street, avenues,

to the CATV system of the grantee.

not inconsistent with a franchise granted hereunder, or that an
intergovernmental agreement or contract is made by and between the City and the
County in connection with the extension of the system and the offering of
services of the system to potential subscribers in areas outside of the City's
corporate limits, the grantee may so extend the system and offer services to
potential subscribers within such areas.
   (g)   Where the density of residential dwellings and occupied commercial or
industrial structures, adverse terrain or other factors render the extension of
the system and offering of services impractical or technically infeasible or
create an economic hardship, the corporate authorities may, upon petition of
the grantee, either waive the extension of the system into such areas or allow
the extension and offering of services on such special terms, conditions and
provisions as are reasonable and fair to the City, the grantee and potential
subscribers in such areas.
   (h)   The grantee shall be required to extend service to any area within the
franchise area subdivided or constructed after the effective date of this

such franchise maintain in full force and effect, a corporate surety bond or
other adequate surety agreement in the amount and kind specified in the
franchise ordinance and conditioned that in the event the grantee shall fail to
comply with any one or more of the provisions of such franchise and this
chapter, then there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the

a continuing obligation during the entire term of such franchise and thereafter
until the grantee shall have satisfied in full any and all obligations to the
City and any subscriber which arise out of or pertain to said franchise.
Neither the provisions of this subsection, any bond accepted by the City
pursuant hereto nor any damages recovered by the City thereunder, shall be
construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee, or limit the liability
of the grantee under any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter.
   (b)   Insurance. The grantee shall keep the system and system facilities
continuously insured against such risks as are customarily insured against by
businesses of like size and type, including, but not limited to:

been installed in the system facilities.
      (2)   Insurance to the extent of two million dollars ($2,000,000) per
occurrence against liability for bodily injury, including death, and to the

provided in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Indemnification. The grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the
City and its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees, against and
from any and all claims, demands, causes of actions, actions, suits,
proceedings, damages (including, but not limited to, damages to City property,
damages arising out of copyright infringements and damages arising out of any
failure by the grantee to secure consents from the owners, authorized
distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by the grantee's cable
television system), costs or liabilities (including costs or liabilities of the
City with respect to its employees), of every kind and nature whatsoever,
including, but not limited to, damages for injury or death or damage to persons
or property, and regardless of the merit of any of the same, against all
liability to others, and against any loss, cost and expense resulting or
arising out of any of the same, including any attorneys' fees, accountants'
fees, expert witness or consultant fees, court costs, per diem expenses,
traveling and transportation expenses or other costs or expenses arising out
of, or pertaining to, the exercise or the enjoyment of any franchise hereunder
by the grantee, or the granting thereof by the City. This indemnity shall
include the duty to indemnify, defend and save whole and harmless the City from
any and all Federal anti-trust suits, restraint of trade suits, unfair
competition suits or similar litigation, and any damages awarded thereunder or
any penalties or fines assessed by reason of the operation of a CATV franchise
system by the grantee under the terms of this chapter and any franchise
ordinance granting a franchise to the grantee.
   (d)   City to be Co-Insured. The grantee shall have the City and all of its
officers and employees included as co-insured on all insurance policies
referred to in this section. The grantee shall file with the City copies of all

   (e)   Defense of Litigation. The grantee shall, at the sole risk and expense
of such grantee, upon demand of the City, made by and through the City Legal
Counsel of the City, appear in and defend any and all suits, actions or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative,
legislative or otherwise, brought, instituted or had by third persons or duly
constituted authorities, against or affecting the City and its officers,
boards, commissions, agents or employees, and arising out of or pertaining to
the exercise or the enjoyment of such franchise, or the granting thereof by the
City.
      The grantee shall pay and satisfy and shall cause to be paid and
satisfied any judgment, decree, order, directive or demand rendered, made or
issued against such grantee, the City and its officers, boards, commissions,
agents or employees, in any of these premises, and such indemnity shall exist

whatsoever, without the specific authorization of the corporate authorities,
expressed by resolution, and of affected subscribers. The foregoing
notwithstanding, the grantee shall be allowed to perform monitoring which is
necessary for the normal delivery of system services, provided, however, that
such monitoring shall be done in a manner that does not infringe upon the
rights of subscribers, and provided, further, that the grantee shall disclose
to the City all such monitoring activities, if any. In all respects in
connection with the system, the grantee and the City shall protect the rights
and privacy of subscribers and others.
(1977 Code §11 1/2-109; Ord. 83-2. Passed 2-7-83; Ord. 97-21. Passed 7-21-97;
Ord. 2017-56. Passed 7-17-17.)
816.09 CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Within thirty days after acceptance of any franchise, the grantee
shall proceed with due diligence to obtain all necessary permits and
authorizations which are required in the conduct of its business, including,
but not limited to, any utility joint use attachment agreements, microwave
carrier licenses and any other permits, licenses and authorizations to be
granted by duly constituted regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the
operation of cable television systems or associated microwave transmission
facilities. In connection therewith, copies of all petitions, applications and
communications submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, or to any
other Federal or State regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in
respect to any matters affecting the grantee's cable television operations,
shall also be submitted simultaneously to the City Manager.
   (b)   Within ninety days after obtaining all necessary permits, licenses and
authorizations, including right of access to poles and conduits, the grantee
shall commence construction and installation of the cable television system.
   (c)   Within 180 days after the commencement of construction and
installation of the system, the grantee shall complete construction of the
facilities needed to permit the reception of broadcast signals and the
origination of programming within the franchise area. The grantee shall
complete construction of a sufficient cable distribution plant to make basic
service available to twenty percent of the franchise area at the end of the
first year of said commencement date and to make basic service available to an
additional twenty percent of the franchise area at the end of each of the
succeeding four years, provided, however, that Council may approve exceptions
to this standard upon a showing by the grantee of undue hardship or expense.
Prior to commencement of construction of the distribution system, the grantee
shall submit a construction schedule and map to the City showing in detail the
geographic location of the portion of the franchise area to be wired during
each of the five construction periods and shall construct the distribution
system in accordance with such schedule, as adopted or modified by Council.
   (d)   Failure on the part of the grantee to commence and diligently pursue
each of the foregoing requirements and to complete each of the matters set
forth herein shall be grounds for termination of such franchise. The ordinance
granting the franchise may contain a provision that, by acceptance of the
franchise, the grantee agrees that failure to comply with any time requirements
referred to in subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereof will result in damage to the
City and that it is, and will be, impracticable to determine the actual amount
of such damage in the event of delay, and that the grantee therefore agrees
that, in addition to any other damage suffered by the City, such grantee will
pay to the City the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each and
every day's delay beyond the time prescribed, for completion of any of the acts
required to be done by this section.
   (e)   The grantee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other
facilities whenever possible, and shall not construct or install any new,
different or additional poles, conduits or other facilities without first
securing the written approval of the Public Works Director, provided that the
privilege of the grantee to construct, install or replace any poles, conduits
or other facilities in, on or over any street shall at all times be subject to
the right of the City, in the exercise of its police power or pursuant to the
terms hereof, upon reasonable notice to the grantee, to require that any such
conduits or other facilities of the grantee be constructed, installed, placed
or replaced beneath the surface of the streets and that any construction,
installation, placement, replacement or changes which may be so required shall
be made at the expense of the grantee.
   (f)   The City shall have the right, free of charge, to make additional use,
for any public or Municipal purpose, whether governmental or proprietary, of
any poles, conduits or other facilities erected, controlled or maintained
exclusively by or for the grantee in any street or other public way or public
place, provided that such use by the City does not interfere with the use by
the grantee.
   (g)   The grantee shall, at the expense of such grantee, protect, support,
temporarily disconnect or temporarily relocate any property of the grantee
when, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, the same is required by
reason of a highway or street construction change, the establishment of street
grade or the installation of sewers, drains or waterpipes.
   (h)   In the event that the use of any part of the system of the grantee is
discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of thirty days, without
prior written notice to, and approval by, the City Manager, that any part of
such system has been installed in any street or other area without complying
with the requirements hereof or that any franchise shall be terminated or
cancelled or shall expire, the grantee shall, at the option of the City and at
the expense of the grantee and at no expense to the City, promptly remove from
any street or other area all property of the grantee, and the grantee shall
promptly restore the street or other area from which such property has been
removed to such condition as the Public Works Director shall approve, provided
that Council may, upon written application therefor by the grantee, approve the
abandonment of any of such property in place by the grantee under such terms
and conditions as the Council may prescribe. Upon abandonment of any such
property in place, the grantee shall cause to be executed, acknowledged and
delivered to the City such instruments as the City Legal Counsel shall
prescribe and approve, conveying the ownership of such property to the City.
   (i)   Upon the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee to cause any work
or other act required by law or by this chapter to be completed in, on, over or
under any street within any time prescribed therefor, or upon notice given,
where notice is prescribed, the Public Works Director may cause such work or
other act to be completed, in whole or in part, and upon so doing shall submit
to the grantee an itemized statement of the costs thereof, and the grantee
shall, within thirty days after receipt of such statement, pay to the City the
entire amount thereof.
   (j)   Unless otherwise provided in any given instance, where any time is
prescribed herein for the doing or causing to be done of any act, Council, for
good cause, stated in writing, may extend any time for two additional periods
of not to exceed ninety days each. Further, the running of any time period
specified herein shall be automatically tolled whenever, and so long as, the
certificate of compliance issued by the Federal Communications Commission to
the grantee is the subject of a petition for stay, petition for review or
appeal filed with any United States court.

with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of
the said streets, alleys or other public ways and places and not to interfere
with existing public utility installations. All service lines shall be
underground in those areas of the City where both public utilities providing
telephone or electric service are underground at the time of installation. In

done by it, or under its supervision and direction, at the expense of the
grantee.
   (h)   The City shall have the right to install and maintain, free of charge,
upon the property of the grantee, its own equipment, including, but not limited
to, a police and fire system and emergency services disaster agency, on the
condition that such equipment does not interfere with the grantee's
establishment, construction, operation and maintenance of the system.
   (i)   If the grantee seeks to construct and maintain its cables and other
system facilities on or above public or private property, and an easement for
such use has already been granted to a telephone company or electric or other
public utility, said easement shall, if at all possible, be interpreted so as
to grant the grantee the same rights and privileges as have been granted to the
telephone and electric companies and other public utilities. In such easements,
the words "telephone" or "telephone company," "electric company" and the like,
shall be interpreted to include the grantee. The grantee shall not be required
to install cable to service areas where the required easements are not
reasonably obtainable.
(1977 Code § 11 1/2-113; Ord. 83-2. Passed 2-7-83.)
816.13 LIMITATIONS.
   In addition to any other franchise limitations hereunder or as herein
provided, the following limitations shall apply to any franchise granted or
renewed by Council under this chapter:
   (a)   Nature of Franchises. Such franchise shall be nonexclusive, and
neither the granting thereof nor any of the provisions contained herein or in
such franchise shall limit, abridge, diminish, alter or affect the right,
privilege, power or authority of Council to issue or grant additional CATV
franchises the same as, or similar to, the franchise granted to any grantee
hereunder to one or more additional grantees at any time or times hereafter,
and Council hereby reserves and preserves the right to grant any identical or
similar franchise to any person, firm or corporation other than the grantee,
either within, without, partly within or partly without the franchise area of
any grantee, subject only to the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Transferability of Franchises.
      (1)   Any franchise granted hereunder shall be a privilege to be held in
personal trust by the original grantee. It cannot in any event be sold,
transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by
forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or
otherwise, without prior consent of Council and then only under such conditions
as may be prescribed by Council. Any such transfer or assignment shall be made
only by an instruction, in writing, such as a bill of sale, or similar
document, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the
City Legal Counsel within thirty days after any such transfer or assignment.
Said consent of Council may not be unreasonably refused, provided, however,
that the proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as determined by
Council and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise and of
this chapter and provided, further, that no such consent shall be required for
a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other hypothecation, in whole or in part, to
secure an indebtedness, except that when such hypothecation shall exceed fifty
percent of the market value of the property used by the franchisee in the
conduct of the cable television system, prior consent of Council shall be
required for such a transfer. Such consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.
      (2)   In the event that the grantee is a corporation, prior approval of
Council, expressed by resolution, shall be required where there is an actual
change in control or where ownership of more than fifty percent of the voting
stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in
concert, none of whom already own fifty percent or more of the voting stock,
singly or collectively.
   (c)   Terms of Franchises. No franchise granted or renewed by Council under
this chapter shall be for a term shorter than five years, unless terminated
prior to its expiration as herein provided, nor shall any such franchise be
granted or renewed for a term longer than fifteen years. Any franchise renewal
shall be subject to the prior approval of Council.
   (d)   Recourse Against City for Loss, Damage, Etc. The grantee shall have no
recourse or remedy whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost, expense or
damage arising out of, or with respect to, any franchise hereunder.
   (e)   Application of City Ordinances, Rules and Regulations. The grantee
shall be subject to all ordinances, rules, regulations and specifications of
the City heretofore or hereafter established, including, but not limited to,
those pertaining to works and activities in, on, over, under and about streets.
   (f)   Prohibited Activities of Grantees. The grantee shall be prohibited
from directly or indirectly doing any of the following:
      (1)   Engaging in the business of selling at retail, leasing, renting,
repairing or servicing of television sets or radios;
      (2)   Soliciting, referring or causing or permitting the solicitation or
referral of any subscriber to persons engaged in any business herein prohibited
to be engaged in by the grantee;
      (3)   Providing information concerning the viewing patterns of
identifiable individual subscribers to any person, group or organization for
any purpose, without the consent of the subscriber;
      (4)   Entering, encroaching upon, interfering with or obstructing any
private property without the express consent of the owner or occupant; or
      (5)   Providing any repair service to its subscribers for a fee, which
repair extends beyond the connection of its service or the determination by the
grantee of the quality of its signal to the recipients thereof.

816.14 ENLARGEMENT OF FRANCHISE AREA TO INCLUDE ANNEXED TERRITORY.
   (a)   If new territory shall be annexed to the City which shall be
contiguous to only one of any franchise area in the City, said franchise area
shall thereafter be deemed to include the new territory.
   (b)   If new territory shall be annexed to the City which shall be
contiguous to more than one franchise area in the City, or which shall not be
contiguous to any franchise area, then Council shall invite all grantees of
franchises hereunder to submit sealed bids for such new territory, and such new
territory shall become a part of the franchise area of the grantee determined
by Council to be best suited to provide service to such territory based upon
the quality of past service, proximity of facilities and capability.

816.16 TERMINATION OF FRANCHISES.
   Willful failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee to comply with any
requirement of this chapter, or any term or condition of a franchise issued
hereunder, shall be sufficient cause for termination of any franchise by the
City, as follows:
   (a)   Upon the continuing of any such failure, refusal or neglect for a
period of thirty days next following written demand by the City Manager that
the grantee do or comply with any such requirement, limitation, term or
condition, the City Manager may cause to be placed upon the agenda of a regular
session of Council his or her request for termination of such franchise, and in
such case, the City Manager shall cause to be served upon such grantee, at
least thirty days prior to the date of such session of Council, a written
notice of his or her intent to request such termination at the time and place
of such session.
   (b)   At such session of Council, or any adjournment thereof, Council shall
consider the request of the City Manager, shall hear any persons desiring to be
heard and shall determine whether or not any such failure, refusal or neglect
by the grantee was with just cause.
   (c)   If Council shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by the
grantee was without just cause, then Council may pass its resolution declaring
that the franchise of such grantee shall be terminated and forfeited unless
there shall be compliance by the grantee within thirty days, and such
resolution shall operate to declare such franchise terminated and forfeited on
the thirtieth day next following the passage thereof, and without further
notice to the grantee, unless the grantee shall so comply within such thirty-
day period, such termination and forfeiture to become effective for all
purposes 180 days thereafter.
   (d)   Within 180 days after such declaration of termination and forfeiture,
the grantee may sell, remove or transfer the entire system of the grantee,
subject to the provisions of Section
816.13(b), and upon any such sale or transfer, in addition to any other rights
hereunder or otherwise, the City shall have a lien (next in order of preference
to any liens or encumbrances existing of record on the date of such termination
and forfeiture) against any and all proceeds thereof, in the full amount of any
loss, cost, expense or other financial detriment incurred by the City in the
exercise of any right hereunder, or by reason of such termination and
forfeiture.
   (e)   If the grantee shall fail or refuse to sell, remove or transfer the
entire system of the grantee, as hereinabove provided, and regardless of the
exercise of any other right of the City hereunder, then the City may institute
appropriate court action to enforce the requirements of this section.
(1977 Code §11 1/2-117; Ord. 83-2. Passed 2-7-83; Ord. 2017-56. Passed 7-17-

816.17 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   From and after the effective date of this chapter, it shall be
unlawful for any person to construct, install or maintain within any public
street in the City, within any other public property of the City or within any
privately-owned area within the City which has not yet become a public street
but is designated or delineated as a proposed public street on any tentative
subdivision map approved by the City, any equipment or facilities for
distributing any television signals or radio signals through a cable television
system, unless a franchise authorizing such use of such street, property or
area has first been obtained pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and
unless such franchise is in full force and effect.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to make or
use any unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically,
acoustically, inductively or otherwise, with any part of a franchised cable
television system within this City for the purpose of enabling himself, herself
or others to receive or use any television signal, radio signal, picture,
program or sound, without payment to the owner of said system.
   (c)   It shall be unlawful for any person, without the consent of the owner,
to willfully tamper with, remove or injure any cables, wires or equipment used

(1977 Code § 11 1/2-118; Ord. 83-2. Passed 2-7-83.)
816.18 REGULATION OF BASIC SERVICE RATES AND EQUIPMENT AND INSTALLATION RATES.
   In regard to the regulation of basic cable service rates and rates for
equipment, including rates for the installation thereof, used to receive the
basic service tier, the City hereby adopts the following provisions:
   (a)   Purposes. The purposes of this section are to:
      (1)   Regulate the rates and fees of each natural person, partnership,
domestic or foreign corporation, association, joint venture and organization of
any kind granted a franchise (hereinafter referred to as the "franchisee") by
the corporate authorities of the City under the provisions of this chapter for
regular subscriber service and all other subscriber and user services, to the
extent permitted by law and the rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission (hereinafter referred to as the "FCC");
      (2)   Provide rate regulations in the City that are consistent with the
rate regulations prescribed by the FCC; and
      (3)   Provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of
interested parties in the setting of basic cable rates and rates for equipment
and installation used to receive the basic service tier in the City.
   (b)   Full Regulatory Power of City Reserved.
       (1)   All rates and charges for basic cable service and any other cable
programming services, as defined by the Cable Television Consumer Protection
and Competition Act of 1992 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") and
applicable FCC regulations, shall, to the extent permissible, be subject to
regulation by the corporate authorities in a manner provided by this section. A
franchisee operating in the City shall be subject to the rate regulation
provisions provided for herein and those of the FCC at 47 CFR, Part 76.900,
Subpart N, as amended and as incorporated by reference herein.
      (2)   The Public Utilities Committee of Council shall propose for
adoption by Council certain procedures to be followed in its exercise of rate
regulation within the City.
   (c)   Adoption of FCC Rate Standards; File Copies; Liberal Construction.
      (1)   The rules and regulations of the FCC for the regulation of basic
cable service rates and for the regulation of rates for equipment, including
rates for the installation thereof, used to receive the basic service tier
(hereinafter referred to as the "FCC Rate Standards"), adopted by the FCC on
April 1, 1993, and published as 47 CFR, Part 76.900, Subpart N, "Cable Rate
Regulations," are hereby adopted by reference as the rate standards of the
City.
      (2)   The City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to keep on file in
the office of the City Clerk three copies of the aforementioned FCC Rate
Standards and to make the same available for public use, inspection and
examination. In accordance with 65 ILCS 5/1-3-2, three copies of the
aforementioned FCC Rate Standards have been on file with the City Clerk for at
least thirty days prior to their adoption by reference.
      (3)   This section shall be liberally construed and applied to promote
its purposes in a manner consistent with said FCC Rate Standards.
   (d)   Public Notice of Rates and Increases.
       (1)   Notice to the general public, and to persons affected, of a
franchisee's rates on the initial date of regulation under this section, and of
any increases proposed by a franchisee, shall be given by a grantee as follows:
         A.   The franchisee shall maintain in its office and keep open for
public inspection a copy of the franchisee's applicable schedule of rates for
its subscribers in the City.
         B.   Within thirty days of receiving written notification from the
City that the City has been certified by the FCC to regulate rates for the
basic service tier, and whenever a franchisee files any proposed increase in
its schedule of rates, the franchisee shall post in each of its offices within
the City a notice that review of such initial rates or any proposed increase is
pending before the City.
       (2)   The corporate authorities of the City shall comply with the
provisions of the Illinois Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS 120/1 et seq.) in the
exercise of their regulatory authority pursuant to this section.
   (e)   Procedures for Implementing Rate Regulation.
       (1)   Upon adoption of this section, a representative of the corporate
authorities shall send to a franchisee within the City, via certified mail,
return receipt requested, a written notice, which shall include a copy of this
section and the completed FCC Form 328.
      (2)   The franchisee shall thereafter have thirty days to respond to the
above notice with rate and benchmark information, utilizing FCC Form 393,
"Determination of Maximum Initial Permitted Rates for Regulated Cable Services
and Actual Cost of Equipment."
      (3)   If the initial rates and/or any subsequent rate increase are within
the FCC Rate Standards, the rates will be effective thirty days after
submission.
      (4)   If the corporate authorities are unable to determine whether the
rate in issue is within the FCC Rate Standards, based on the material before
it, or if the franchisee has submitted a cost-of-service showing, seeking to
justify a rate above the FCC's reasonable rate level, the corporate authorities
may take an additional period of time to make a final determination and toll
the effective date of the proposed rates for a commensurate period.
         A.   The corporate authorities may take an additional ninety days if
they need more time to ensure that rates proposed by the franchisee are within
the FCC Rate Standards.
         B.   The corporate authorities may take an additional 150 days to
evaluate a cost-of-service showing, seeking to justify a rate above the
reasonable rate level.
         C.   The corporate authorities must issue a brief written decision
regarding their invocation of the additional time periods.
      (5)   If no action is taken within the above-referenced time periods, the
proposed rates will go into effect, subject to subsequent refund orders if the
corporate authorities later issue a decision disapproving any portion of the
proposed rates.
      (6)   In all cases, the corporate authorities will issue a written
decision to approve the franchisee rate schedule, disapprove the rate schedule
or continue for review.
      (7)   If the franchisee's rates are in excess of the FCC Rate Standards,
the corporate authorities may order the franchisee to reduce or roll back, on a
prospective basis, those existing basic cable rates which the corporate
authorities have disapproved pursuant to applicable FCC regulations.
      (8)   In addition to the foregoing, after reasonable notice to the
franchisee and an opportunity to comment, the corporate authorities may order
the franchisee to refund to its subscribers that portion of previously paid
rates which the corporate authorities determine to be in excess of the FCC Rate
Standards. The period covered by a refund order of the corporate authorities
shall be set forth as follows:
         A.   From the date a franchisee implements a prospective rate
reduction order issued by the corporate authorities back in time to September
1, 1993, or one year, whichever is shorter.
         B.   From the date the corporate authorities or the hearing examiner
issues an accounting order, and ending on the date the franchisee implements a
prospective rate reduction ordered by the corporate authorities, or one year,
whichever is shorter. For purposes of this paragraph, an accounting order is a
brief written order issued by the corporate authorities or the hearing
examiner, directing the franchisee to keep an accurate account of all amounts
received by the franchisee by reason of the initial rate and on whose behalf
such amounts were paid.
            If a franchisee fails to comply with a valid rate order issued by
the corporate authorities, the franchisee shall be liable for refunds
commencing from the effective date of such order until such time as the
franchisee complies with such order.
            Refunds shall include interest computed at the rates applicable for
tax refunds and additional tax payments as published by the Internal Revenue
Service.
      (9)   A franchisee may, in its discretion, implement a refund order
issued by the corporate authorities as follows:
         A.   By returning the overcharges to those subscribers who actually
paid such overcharges (either through direct payment or as a specifically
identified credit to those subscribers' bills); or
         B.   By a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for basic
cable service or associated equipment to cover the cumulative overcharge. This
reduction shall be identified specifically by the franchisee as a one-time
credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that have been
overcharged by the franchisee.
      (10)   After the initial rate schedule procedures are followed, as
described in this section, the franchisee shall, in conjunction with each
change in rates and charges applicable to basic cable service, conform to the
standards of the FCC and any procedural rules adopted by the corporate
authorities.
       (11)   To the extent specifically permitted by Federal law and
applicable FCC rules, the franchisee may appeal to the FCC for a review of any
decision of the corporate authorities.
   (f)   Utilization of Rate Consultants; Payment of Costs.
       (1)   The corporate authorities may utilize a rate consultant to advise
them on proposed rate changes and to assist them in their procedures and the
standards for review adopted by the FCC. A rate consultant may be any person
who has sufficient background and experience, in the sole opinion of the
corporate authorities, to properly evaluate and analyze rates and charges.
      (2)   Unless contrary to applicable rules of the FCC governing these
procedures, or unless otherwise specifically pre-empted by State or Federal
law, all costs for the review of initial rates or rate changes shall be paid by
the cable operator upon demand of the corporate authorities of the City. The
costs shall include, but not be limited to, rate consultants, attorneys' fees
and the reasonable value of the services (as determined by the City) rendered
by the City or any employees, agents or representatives of the City. The costs
payable by the franchisee to the City under this section, together with the
payment of any franchise fee pursuant to provisions of a franchise granted by
the City, shall not exceed the allowable percentage of the franchisee's gross
revenues payable to the City in accordance with Section 622 of Title VI of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Act.
   (g)   Application of Section. The requirements described in this section are
applicable to any franchisee within the City subject to rate regulation in
accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Act, as
hereafter amended, and in accordance with applicable FCC rules and regulations.
(Ord. 94-29. Passed 5-16-94.)
816.19 ENFORCEMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS.
   (a)   To the extent permitted by Federal law and applicable FCC rules, and
pursuant to any rules or regulations adopted by the City, the corporate
authorities shall enforce consumer protection and customer service standards,
including, but not limited to, franchisee office hours and telephone
availability; installations, outages and service calls; and communications
between a franchisee and its subscriber, including standards governing bills
and refunds.
   (b)   The City Clerk is hereby authorized to provide any affected franchisee
with ninety days prior written notice, by certified mail, of the intention of
the corporate authorities to enforce the above-referenced consumer protection
and customer service standards.

violation of insurance requirements, and a period of ten days for every day of

871.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-oriented adult
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare
of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult businesses
within the City. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable
access to any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials.
Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-
oriented entertainment to their intended market. This chapter does not apply to
theaters, performing arts centers, civic centers, and dinner theaters where
live dance, ballet, music, and dramatic performances of serious artistic merit
are offered on a regular basis and in which the predominant business or
attraction is not the offering of entertainment which is intended for the
sexual interests or titillation of customers, and where the establishment is
not distinguished by an emphasis on or the advertising or promotion of nude or
semi-nude performances. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
   (b)   Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of sexually-
oriented adult uses, presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
City, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Los Angeles v.
Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); Pap's A.M. v. City of Erie, 529 U.S.

on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The
Regulation Of Adult uses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the City finds:
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, illicit sex acts,
potential spread of sexually transmitted diseases, lewdness, public indecency,
illegal drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values,
urban blight, pornographic litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at
unregulated sexually-oriented businesses, especially those which provide
private or semi-private rooms, booths, or cubicles for viewing films, videos,
or live sexually explicit shows.
      (3)   The consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of sexually-
oriented businesses exacerbates the deleterious secondary effects of such
businesses.
      (4)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating.

876.01 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed
to them for the purposes of this Chapter of the Codified Ordinances of the City
of Freeport, as follows:
   (a)   “Landlord.” The legal title holder of the premises, as shown by the
records of the Stephenson County Recorder’s office, which has one or more
residential rental units on it. If the legal title holder is a land trust,
however, the landlord shall mean the beneficial owner or owners of the land
trust, or a trustee having legal authority to act on behalf of the land trust.
   (b)   “Local agent.” A person 21 years of age or older who resides in
Stephenson County or within 30 miles of the location of the rental unit. The
local agent shall be authorized by the landlord to receive notices of code
violations and receive process in any court proceedings or administrative
enforcement proceedings on behalf of the landlord in connection with the
enforcement of this Chapter or any of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Freeport and any enforcement of state or federal laws or regulations. A local
agent is a convenience for the landlord and is only for the purposes of receipt
of notices and process. Nothing in this section shall transfer responsibility
for compliance with this section to the local agent. In all circumstances the
landlord shall remain responsible for any violations and any penalties imposed
hereunder and may not transfer the responsibility for compliance to a tenant or
party who does not have an ownership interest.
   (c)   “Premises.” A tract of land on which one or more rental units is
located.
   (d)   “Residential rental structure.” Any apartment, rooming house, boarding
house, dwelling, multi-use dwelling structure (excluding hotels, motels,

defined elsewhere in these Codified Ordinances) - and any mobile home - located
within the corporate limits of the City of Freeport that the owner thereof
rents, either entirely or in part, to another person or persons for occupancy
as a residence, regardless of the zoning of the property. If there is more than
one unit within such structure, it shall be identified by the term residential
rental unit. A property which is the subject of a land contract will be
considered a residential rental structure unless conversion of the title has
taken place as shown through the filing of such document in the Stephenson
County Recorder's office and taxes are being assessed in the name of the
purchaser. Notwithstanding the filing of a land contract in the Stephenson
County Recorder's office and the assessment of taxes, a purported land contract
shall be considered a rental if the transaction is in excess of thirty years.
In lieu of providing proof as stated above, a land contract will not be
considered a rental property if the seller provides evidence to the Finance
Director and the City Legal Counsel that clearly establishes that the property
is treated for tax purposes as interest income.
   (e)   “Tenant.” The person, or person, occupying a residential rental unit
who is not a legal title holder of the premises.

rental structure to rent that residential rental structure or unit thereof,

person that is the controlling individual on that entity, or in the case of a
land trust, a natural person that is the trustee having legal authority to act

Crime Free Housing Lease Provision
Prohibition against nuisance activity within the City of Freeport.
Notice of City of Freeport Ordinances. The City of Freeport has enacted the
following in its Code of Ordinances:
Chapter 659. Chronic Nuisances. This Chapter prohibits nuisance properties
located within the corporate limits of the City of Freeport.
Crime free agreement:
In consideration of the execution or renewal of a lease of the rental unit
identified in this lease (the “leased premises”), Owner (or Owner’s agent or
representative) and resident/tenant agree as follows:
   (i)   The Tenant, any member of the Tenant’s household, Tenant’s guest(s),
and any person under Tenant’s control shall not engage in or facilitate
unlawful activity in, on, at or about the leased premises.
   (ii)   The Tenant, any member of the Tenant’s household, Tenant’s guest(s),
and any person under Tenant’s control shall not permit the leased premises to
be used for, or to facilitate, unlawful activity, regardless of whether the
individual engaging in such activity is a member of the household, or a guest.
   (iii)   The Tenant, any member of the Tenant’s household, Tenant’s guest(s),
and any person under Tenant’s control shall not engage in or facilitate any
breach of the lease agreement that jeopardizes the health, safety, and welfare
of the landlord, his agent, or other tenant, or involves imminent or actual
serious property damage.
   (iv)   The Tenant is vicariously liable for the unlawful activity of any
member of the Tenant’s household, Tenant’s guest(s), and any person under
Tenant’s control, whether or not the Tenant had knowledge of the activity or
whether or not the household member or guest was under the Tenant’s control.
   (v)   In case of conflict between the provisions of this addendum and any
other provisions of the lease, the provisions of this addendum shall govern.
   (vi)   For purposes of this Lease Section, unlawful activity shall mean:
      1.   Any offense defined and prohibited by Section 6-16 (Prohibited Sales
and Possession) or Section 6-20 (Purchase or Acceptance of Gift of Liquor by
Persons Under Age 21) of the Liquor Control Act of 1934, 235 ILCS 5/6-16 and 5/
6-20, or similar City of Freeport ordinance;
      2.   Any offense that constitutes a felony or misdemeanor under the
Illinois Criminal Code of 1961, 720 ILCS 5/1-1 et seq;
      3.   Any offense defined and prohibited by
Chapter 659 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Freeport; and

Offenses) of the Criminal Code of 1961, 720 ILCS 5/8-1, et seq., which is
relative to the commission of any of the aforesaid principal offenses.
      5.   Violation of any of the above provisions shall be a material and
irreparable violation of the lease and good cause for termination of the
tenancy, provided, however, a Tenant shall not be retaliated against nor
evicted when merely a victim of any unlawful act prohibited herein, but shall
be responsible for the acts of his/her guests and persons under his/her
control. A single violation of any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed a
serious single violation shall be good cause for immediate termination of the
lease. Unless otherwise provide by law, proof of violation shall not require
criminal conviction, but shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. Tenant
consents to venue in any court within the county wherein the unit is located in
the event Owner initiates legal action against the tenant. Tenant hereby waives
any objection to any venue chosen by Owner.
To the extent permitted by law, Tenant agrees that service of process of any
legal proceeding, including but not limited to a special detainer or forcible
detainer action, or service of any notice to Tenant, shall be effective and
sufficient for purposes of providing legal service and conferring personal
jurisdiction upon any Illinois court as to any Tenant, co-signor, occupant or
guarantor, if served upon any occupant or other person of suitable age and
discretion who is present at the premises and residing therein, notwithstanding
the fact that a Tenant, co-signor, occupant or guarantor may reside at a
different location other than the property address described in the lease
agreement. This agreement regarding service is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any manner of service authorized under Illinois law or rule. By signing
this lease the undersigned hereby waives any objection to service carried out
under the terms of this agreement.
   (d)   A provision must be included in a lease to authorize a landlord to ban
tenant guests whose conduct is prohibited by the crime free housing lease
addendum, as described in subsection (c) of this section.

providing that sworn personnel from the City’s Police Department shall be
authorized to give persons trespassing on private property notice to leave, and

hotel rooms shall maintain complete and accurate books and records, including a
daily sheet showing the gross receipts for the hotel rentals for the day
reported.
   (f)   For purposes of enforcing and administering this chapter, the Finance
Director or his or her designee may, after providing reasonable notice, have

tax due.

such service;
      (7)   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related
to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under

governments, including state universities created by statute, or any city,
town, county, or other political subdivision of this state.
   (g)   "Purchase at retail" means the acquisition, consumption or use of
telecommunications through a sale at retail.
   (h)   "Retailer" means and includes every person engaged in the business of

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the Department, furnishes adequate security to
insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the Department at its discretion.
   (i)   "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state", or any like
term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state,
directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission
facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or
other representative operating within this state under the authority of the
retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or
agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or

subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
   (k)   "Service address" means the location of telecommunications equipment
from which telecommunications services are originated or at which
telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may
not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and
maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as
defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-
ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a
taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by
telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are
sent.
   (l)   "Taxpayer" means a person who individually or through his or her
agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax
liability as authorized by the chapter.

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this chapter, "private line" means
a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications.
      Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this Section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section
2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.
(Ord. 2003-19. Passed 3-24-03.)
891.02 SIMPLIFIED MUNICIPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS TAX IMPOSED.
   A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:
   (a)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of 5%
of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer.
   (b)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of 5%
of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or privilege that
is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the
taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a
credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this Section to the
extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state
which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local
tax in this state.
   (c)   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality.
(Ord. 2003-19. Passed 3-24-03; Ord. 2003-55. Passed 7-7-03.)
891.03 COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS.
   (a)   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the State. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
   (b)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.
(Ord. 2003-19. Passed 3-24-03.)
891.04 RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT.
   (a)   On or before the last day of February 2004, and on or before the last
day of every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this chapter on
telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and
information as required by the Department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, Section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to implement the
Act.
   (b)   Commencing on February 1, 2004, the tax imposed under this chapter on
telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and
information as required by the Department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, Section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to implement this
Act.
(Ord. 2003-19. Passed 3-24-03; Ord. 2003-55. Passed 7-7-03.)
891.05 RESELLERS.
   (a)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (b)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (c)   Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
taxfree on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.

property. The delivery of any deed shall be deemed to occur when the transferee
or purchaser, or his or her representative or agent, receives possession of the
deed. The delivery of an assignment of a beneficial interest shall be deemed to
occur when the trustee receives possession of a valid assignment of a

the corpus of which contains a beneficial interest in real property.

corporation, political subdivision of the State, domestic or foreign

as a unit, whether mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise, and
the United States or any instrumentality thereof. Whenever the term "person" is

associations, shall mean the owners or part owners thereof, and as applied to

the agreement or contract to transfer such is entered into in the City.
(Ord. 92-21. Passed 7-6-92.)
892.02 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   A tax is hereby imposed of two dollars ($2.00) for each ($500.00) of the
transfer price, or fraction thereof, of real property or beneficial interest
therein which is being transferred. The tax shall be calculated upon the net
taxable consideration subject to State and County property transfer taxes. Such
tax is due upon the filing, recording or delivery of the deed or of the
assignment of beneficial interest. The ultimate incidence of, and liability
for, payment of such tax in all cases shall be borne by the grantor or seller
involved in any such transaction. The tax herein levied shall be in addition to
any and all other taxes and shall be collected on all transactions described
above which occur on or after September 1, 1992. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this section, no such tax shall be due or collected on any
transaction of a sale on contract or of land which occurred on or before July
6, 1992, but whose deed was not presented for filing, recording or delivery
until on or after September 1, 1992. Any person who would be exempt from the
payment of such tax as defined in the preceding sentence and who has paid such
transfer tax may apply, in writing, on forms provided at no cost by the City
Clerk's office for a refund of such City transfer tax paid. Any such refund
application must be filed in the office of the City Clerk on or before March
15, 1993, and shall be accompanied by written documentation acceptable to the
City's Legal Counsel verifying that such transaction was executed on or before
July 6, 1992.

prescribed by the Finance Director or his or her designee, that calculates the

taxable consideration that is subject to State and County property transfer
taxes.

Property Transfer Tax Calculation Form by the Finance Director or his or her
designee's office. Any person affixing a revenue stamp shall initial and date
it with indelible ink.

calculations performed on the real estate transfer declaration described in 35
ILCS 305/3 show that there is no net taxable consideration that is subject to
either a State or County property transfer tax.
(Ord. 97-21. Passed 7-21-97.)
892.04 PREPARATION AND FORM OF REVENUE STAMPS.
   A rubber stamp, for the purpose of paying the tax provided for in this
chapter, shall be prepared by the Finance Director or his or her designee, in
such form as he or she may, from time to time, prescribe, and he or she shall
make provision for the use of such rubber stamp in such places and at such
times as, in his or her judgment, may be necessary to accomplish the equitable,
efficient and economic collection of the taxes so provided.
   The Finance Director or his or her designee may, from time to time and as
often as he or she deems advisable, provide for the issuance and exclusive use
of a rubber stamp of a new design and forbid the use of the rubber stamp of a
former design.
(Ord. 97-21. Passed 7-21-97.)
892.05 FAILURE TO FILE; CIVIL PENALTY; REMEDIES FOR NONPAYMENT.
   Any filing of the Freeport Property Transfer Tax Calculation Form which
occurs more than five days after the filing, recording or delivery of the deed
or of the assignment of beneficial interest shall be deemed a failure to file.
It shall also be considered a failure to file if the amount owed is not
completely paid within that time. In addition to the tax due, the grantor or
seller of the property shall be assessed a civil penalty of ten percent of the
tax due and given thirty days in which to pay the tax and penalty. If the tax
and penalty remain unpaid after thirty days, the City may take any or all of

(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.05   ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   City Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Director of
Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Director of Public Works shall reject such application in
writing, stating the reasons therefore. If the Director of Public Works is
satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter
and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of
Public Works shall issue a permit therefore as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the construction proposed
under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   (b)   Additional City Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4,
a telecommunications retailer shall notify the City that it intends to commence
work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the City not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work
requiring no excavation and not less than thirty days prior to the commencement
of work requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall specify the
portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and
constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide
such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either
(1) ten days after service of notice to the City by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
(2) twenty-five days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer
in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the City, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to Section 1025.04 the telecommunications
retailer shall submit to the City an application for a permit and any and all
plans, specifications and documentation available regarding the facility to be
constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements of
subsection (a) of this section.
   (c)   Additional City Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five days after
submission to the City, unless otherwise acted upon by the City, provided the
holder has complied with applicable City codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.06   EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (a)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the City authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on City rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (b)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (c)   Pre-construction Meeting Required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the City with
such City representatives in attendance as the City deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (d)   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
City does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the City and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.07   REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the City within ninety days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with Section 1025.21. If the City denies the
request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility
from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit
and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.08   INSURANCE.
   (a)   Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the City, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents,
and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in paragraphs (1)
and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         A.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to
each person;
         B.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
         C.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.
      (5)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (b)   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (c)   Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the City within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefore from the City.
   (d)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
      "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled
nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt
by the City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the City Manager of such intent to cancel or not
to renew."
   Within ten days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in no event
later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and
furnish to the City evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (e)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection (a) of this section, or the requirements of
subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-
insure shall provide to the City evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements
required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the
utility is a "private self-insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (f)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the City and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (g)   Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
[All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.]
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13; Ord. 2017-56. Passed 7-17-17.)
1025.09   INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the City and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the City, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.10   SECURITY.
   (a)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the City may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the City must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the City from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (b)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the City in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the City, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
City. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
City and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the City of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the City and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (c)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the City estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the City, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase.
   (d)   Withdrawals. The City, upon fourteen days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the City for such amount within the
fourteen day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the City, any damages, claims, costs or expenses
which the City has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the City
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (e)   Replenishment. Within fourteen days after receipt of written notice
from the City that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in subsection
(c) of this section.
   (f)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the City
upon written request for said withdrawal to the City, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (c) of this section.
   (g)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the City for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the City as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (h)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the City with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the City may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.11   PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (a)   City Right to Revoke Permit. The City may revoke or suspend a permit
issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      (2)   Non-compliance with this chapter;
      (3)   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;
or

(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.18   REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (a)   Notice. Within ninety days following written notice from the City, a
utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
City improvement in or upon, or the operations of the City in or upon, the
rights-of-way.
   (b)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty days following
written notice from the City, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   (c)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The City retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the City, as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or
useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior
to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   (d)   Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the City, the utility shall notify the City within ninety
days. Following receipt of such notice the City may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the City Director of Public Works
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the City does not direct the utility that
abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the
City, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or
removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.19   CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION.
   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the rights-of-
way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by
the utility, all to the satisfaction of the City. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the Director of Public Works. Such cleanup
and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding,
resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition
substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the
project. The time period provided in this section may be extended by the
Director of Public Works for good cause shown.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.20   MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the City and at the utility's expense.
   (b)   Emergency Maintenance Procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the City police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (c)   Emergency Repairs. The utility must file in writing with the City a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within forty-eight
hours after an emergency repair.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.21   VARIANCES.
   (a)   Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the Director of
Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (b)   Authority to Grant Variances. The Director of Public Works shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (c)   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Director of Public Works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (d)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   (e)   Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Director
of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to
appeal to the City Manager, or such other board or commission as he/she may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City
Clerk within thirty days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The City Manager shall commence his or her consideration of the
appeal at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The City Manager
shall timely decide the appeal.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13; Ord. 2017-56. Passed 7-17-17.)
1025.22   ENFORCEMENT.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the City may have for enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.23   SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof.
(Ord. 2013-26. Passed 6-3-13.)
1025.99   PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the City will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the City's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the City. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

1026.01 CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR.
   (a)   Compliance. All sidewalks hereafter constructed or repaired on or
along any street within the City, whether pursuant to any special ordinance or
otherwise, shall, unless otherwise provided by special ordinance, be
constructed or repaired as herein provided.
   (b)   PROWAG Compliance. All sidewalks shall conform to current Public
Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) standards as published from time
to time by the U.S. Access Board.
   (c)   Permit Required. No person shall construct or repair a sidewalk except
in strict accordance with the terms of this chapter and a validly issued permit
obtained from the Department of Public Works authorizing such work or repair.
   (d)   Construction and Design Standards.
      (1)   Thickness: All sidewalks shall be a minimum of five inches (5")
thick. Sidewalks at driveway locations shall be thickened to seven inches (7")
thick with a minimum thickness of six inches (6"), or as determined by the
Public Works Director.
      (2)   Width: Sidewalks shall not be less than five feet (5') in width;
sidewalks in high traffic areas, including the commercial, and downtown
business districts, may require a six foot (6') width or greater, as determined
by the Public Works Director.
      (3)   Subgrade: Sidewalk subgrade material shall be six inches (6") thick
and free of debris, organic material, plastic clays, and other material prone
to freeze-thaw damage. Subgrade material shall be compacted per IDOT standards
to prevent settling under the traffic of building materials delivery vehicles.
      (4)   Location: Sidewalks shall be located on both sides of the street
within the right-of-way. There is to be a minimum one foot space between the
outside edge of the sidewalk and the right-of-way/property line. If excessive
distance is between street crossings, mid-block sidewalks shall be located as
required by the Director of Public Works.
      (5)   Access for developments where normal street configuration does not
provide adequate pedestrian access to schools, parks, commercial centers, or
other pedestrian traffic generators, alternate pedestrian access ways shall be
provided within a dedicated public right-of-way.
      (6)   Sidewalk ramps: Whenever a sidewalk repair or replacement is made
between the intersection of the sidewalk and the street intersection curb
(where no ramp/curb opening exists), such curb shall also be removed and a
sidewalk ramp installed.
      (7)   Minimum geometry requirements: Sidewalk geometry shall comply with
requirements of this chapter, State of Illinois requirements, and PROWAG
requirements. Minimum geometry requirements shall include but not be limited to
the following:
         A.   Recommended grade (longitudinal slope) is five percent (5.00%)
(5/8 in. per ft.) not to exceed 8% (1 in. per ft.) with a landing on top. On
streets steeper than 8.3%, running slope grades can be used on the sidewalk, as
determined by the Public Works Director. Landings shall be provided at regular
intervals as per the current PROWAG guidelines.
         B.   Cross slope (transverse slope) standard shall be one percent
(1.00%) (1/8 in. per ft.) downward in the direction of the back of curb. In no
case shall the sidewalk cross slope be more than two percent (2.00%).
         C.   Ramps: Accessible ramps shall be provided at all necessary
locations per IDOT and PROWAG requirements. Minimum face to face of curb width
on sidewalk ramps shall be five (5) feet.
         D.   Landings: 5'X5' turning space at certain intersections that does
not exceed 2% in any direction.
      (8)   Material requirements: Sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland
Cement Concrete (PCC) from an IDOT approved plant using IDOT approved mix
design and material. Alternative sidewalk pavement materials that provide
stormwater benefits, such as porous concrete, may be approved by the Public
Works Director on a case by case basis.
      (9)   Construction requirements: Sidewalks shall be constructed per the
following minimum standards:
         A.   Forms: Steel forms shall be used. Lumber forms may be used when
constructing sidewalk ramps, curved pavement, or small projects. However, in no
case shall sidewalk be less than four inches (4") inches thick.
         B.   Expansion joints: Expansion joints, 3/4 inch (3/4") thickness,
should be placed only at junctions of pavement and sidewalk, 100' of sidewalk,
and at the intersection of sidewalks.
         C.   Detectable warnings: Only approved truncated dome detectable
warning panels are allowed. Transverse grooving, diamond impressions and other
designs are not allowed.
         D.   Constructed width: When constructing sidewalk ramps, the minimum
sidewalk is five feet (5'). Sidewalk ramp curbs shall be installed such that
the five foot (5') width minimum is not compromised, i.e. the five foot (5')
width shall be maintained throughout–face to face of sidewalk curbs, as
determined by the Public Works Director.
      (10)   Timing: Sidewalks should be constructed prior to occupancy of
buildings/ subdivision. Forms shall be stripped in accordance with the IDOT
standard specification and the sidewalk shall be backfilled immediately after
the forms are stripped.
      (11)   Inspection and testing: All inspecting and testing procedures
shall be followed as stated in the Illinois Department of Transportation
Construction Manual.
   (e)   Storage and Removal of Material. Material used in construction shall
not be stored within ten feet of any fire hydrant. All unused material and all
dirt and rubbish remaining after completion of the walk, shall be immediately
removed.
   (f)   Construction by Special Ordinance.

ordinance.
      (2)   Procedure for particular construction or repair. The owners
described in paragraph (f)(1) hereof shall construct or repair the particular
sidewalk within thirty days after the mailing of notice. In default thereof,
the City may construct or repair such sidewalk and charge the cost thereof to
the defaulting owners, or the City may bring suit against the owners in any
court of competent jurisdiction and obtain a mandatory injunction requiring
them to construct or repair the particular sidewalk.
      (3)   Notice. The Public Works Director shall mail a notice of the
passage of the special ordinance, addressed to the person who last paid the
general taxes on each respective lot or parcel of land. An affidavit of such
service shall be made and filed in the office of the Public Works Director and
shall be prima-facie evidence.

provided for in such ordinance, even though it may be found and determined that
the sidewalks therein provided for are so connected, or otherwise related, as
to constitute a single system of improvement.
   (h)   Special Taxation. If the owner, after construction or repair of the
sidewalk by the City, fails to pay the cost of such construction or repair
forthwith, the Public Works Director, and other officials of the City, shall
proceed immediately to collect the cost of such construction or repair from
such owner by special taxation, by taking the various actions, procedures and
steps for collection provided in 65 ILCS 5/11-84-1 et seq., as amended, all

be the duty of the Public Works Director forthwith to notify, in writing, the
owner of the property abutting upon such sidewalk, or the person last paying
the general taxes on such property, to change, rebuild or reconstruct such walk
to conform to this section.
      (2)   If such owner or person shall fail, refuse or neglect to comply
with the requirements of such notice, the City may proceed, by special
ordinance, with the construction of such walk in accordance with the provisions
and specifications herein contained in place of the walk so built in violation
of this section.
   (l)   Declaration of Nuisance. Any sidewalk constructed contrary to this
section is hereby declared to be a nuisance, and the Public Works Director is

current Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) standards as
published from time to time by the U.S. Access Board.
(Ord. 2022-35. Passed 8-1-22.)
1027.02 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   Applicants for driveway approach permits, also known as driveway permits,
issued under this chapter are required to comply with the provisions of Section
1024.33 concerning insurance where any excavation work is being undertaken or
any other work is otherwise being performed in a public right-of-way.
(Ord. 2022-35. Passed 8-1-22.)
1027.03 MAXIMUM WIDTH; MINIMUM THICKNESS.
   (a)   Curb Cuts. Curb cut widths shall be kept to the minimum needed for
safe ingress from and egress to the street. Residential driveway approaches
shall not exceed twenty-four feet (24') wide at the tangent to the curb radii,
and commercial/industrial driveway approaches shall not exceed thirty-five feet
(35') wide unless approved by the Director of Public Works.
   (b)   Cement. Driveway approaches shall be constructed of Portland Cement
Concrete with a recommended seven inches (7") typical thickness and six inches
(6") minimum thickness and in accordance with applicable sections of the State
Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction. Asphalt approaches
may be approved by the Director of Public Works where (i) an existing approach
currently exists which is made of asphalt, and (ii) the use of the property
serviced is determined to be suitable for an asphalt approach due to low
traffic volume or other relevant factors.
(Ord. 2022-35. Passed 8-1-22.)
1027.04 CONDUITS REQUIRED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
   In areas of the City where the City owns and operates a street lighting
system, a conduit of not less than two inches (2") inside diameter and of a
material of sufficient strength for the particular location and purpose and
necessary hand holes shall be placed in or under all driveways for the purpose
of placing, connecting or maintaining cables for electrical service to the City
street lighting system. Where the driveway is located contiguous to an existing
driveway, the conduit shall be extended under or through the existing driveway.
The location of such cables and hand holes shall be as approved by the Director
of Public Works.
(Ord. 2022-35. Passed 8-1-22.)
1027.05 MAINTENANCE.
   Any person that has a driveway approach across a public sidewalk or parkway

may, but shall not be obligated to, repair such defects at the owner's cost.
The owner shall pay the costs of repair within twenty-one (21) days after the
date of the bill. The amount owed shall constitute a lien upon the adjacent
property until any sums due hereunder are paid in full.
(Ord. 2022-35. Passed 8-1-22.)
1027.06 SPECIFIC DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Width: All driveways shall have a minimum width of ten feet (10') at
the right-of-way line. Curb cut lengths shall be kept to the minimum needed for
good design. Residential driveways shall not exceed twenty-four feet (24') wide
at the tangent to the curb radii (at the throat), and commercial/industrial
shall not exceed thirty-five feet (35') wide unless called for by design
approved by the Public Works Director. If the throat width of a driveway
exceeds sixteen feet (16'), a longitudinal control joint is required.
   (b)   Thickness and Length: Driveway sidewalks shall be replaced to a
recommended thickness of seven inches (7") typical and six inches (6") minimum
across driveway approaches and extend to the nearest joint, a minimum of twelve
inches (12") on either side of the driveway approach. Other sidewalk locations
within right-of-way shall have a minimum thickness of five inches (5") or as
otherwise required by City Code. Thickness for driveways serving commercial or
industrial areas shall be designed for the proposed vehicle use. The driveway
standard requires the driveway sidewalk to be a separately constructed strip
from the rest of the approach. Driveway sidewalk for large commercial or
industrial driveways may be constructed monolithically with the driveway, but
they shall be designed to have the appearance of a thru sidewalk that meets
Public Right-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) requirements via grooving
or other means.
   (c)   Materials: Driveways shall be constructed of Portland Cement Concrete
conforming to the IDOT mix design criteria in the current edition of the
"Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction." Only IDOT approved
mix designs from approved ready mix plants are allowed. The minimum required
compressive strength is 3500 psi in fourteen (14) days. Maximum slump of all
concrete work is four inches (4"). Air entrainment shall be between five
percent and eight percent (5.00% - 8.00%).
   (d)   Subgrade: The subgrade for all sidewalks and driveways shall be free
of all vegetation, debris, and loose material and it shall be tamped or rolled
until thoroughly compacted. Dry subgrade shall be moistened with water just
before the concrete is placed. Overly wet or organic materials shall be removed
and replaced with granular material (sand or gravel) as conditions warrant.
Sidewalk and driveway subgrade shall be compacted sufficiently to prevent
future settlement under the loading of a fully loaded building materials
delivery truck.
   (e)   Conduits: In areas of the City where streetlights exist, driveway
conduits may be required. In such instances, a conduit of not less than two
inches (2") inside diameter, capped on each end, and of material of sufficient
strength (schedule 40 PVC is acceptable) for the particular location and
purpose and any necessary hand holes shall be placed in or under all driveways
for the purpose of placing, connecting, or maintaining cables for electrical
service to the City street lighting system. Where the proposed driveway is
located contiguous to an existing driveway, the conduit shall be extended under
or through the existing driveway.
   (f)   Slopes: All sidewalks shall be constructed to meet current PROWAG
standards. All sidewalks shall have a straight cross slope from the property
side towards the street side of approximately one percent (1.00%) (1/8 inch per
foot), and a maximum of two percent (2.00%) (1/4 inch per foot) cross slope is
required for a five foot (5') sidewalk. Sidewalks and ramps shall be
constructed having a longitudinal slope no greater than eight percent (8.00%)
(1 inch per foot).
   (g)   Grade: All walks shall be reasonably level, which in some instances
may require filling or cutting of earth. The top of the walk shall, in general,
conform to the contour of ground after the aforementioned leveling procedure
has been completed.
   (h)   Joints: All walks shall be provided with 3/4 inch (3/4") expansion
joints placed where the sidewalk abuts the curb. All structures located within
sidewalk pavement shall be surrounded with a minimum 3/4 inch thick expansion
joint. A 3/4 inch expansion joint material shall be placed where the driveway
approach meets the gutter and where the driveway approach meets the sidewalk.
   (i)   Forms: Side forms for sidewalks and driveways shall be of lumber of
not less than 2 inch (2") nominal thickness or of steel of equal rigidity. They
shall be held securely in place by stakes or braces with the top edges true to
line of grade. Depth of forms shall be the same as the required concrete
thickness, with a minimum five inches (5") of depth.
   (j)   Inspections: The forms and grading necessary to complete the
construction of the walk or driveway shall be inspected and approved by a
representative of the City before the concrete is placed. In the absence of the
contractor, the City Inspector may leave tape (yellow, if approved, and red, if
not approved) on a conspicuous location. The City reserves the right to require
pavement cores to verify pavement thickness or removal and replacement at the
owner's expense if a sidewalk or approach is poured without approval.
   (k)   Finishing: All sidewalks and driveway approaches shall be placed,
finished, and cured as required by the Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction in Illinois. After the concrete is placed, it shall be
struck off and finished to a true and even surface with floats and trowels.
After the water sheen has disappeared, the surface shall be given a final
finish by brushing, at right angles to the sidewalk or driveway, with a soft-
bristled push broom. Care shall be taken to not use too much water during the
brushing/finishing process. Curing and protection from hot and cold weather
shall be as required by the IDOT Standard Specification.
   (l)   Panel Size and Scoring: The surface of all sidewalks shall be divided
into panels by grooved joints constructed at right angles with the sidewalk.
These grooves shall be a minimum of 1 inch deep, between 1/8 inch and 1/4 inch
wide. The grooves shall be edged with an edging tool having a 1/4 inch radius.
Sawed grooves shall not be allowed. The groove pattern on replacement slabs
should match the existing pattern. The standard spacing between grooved joints
in areas where sidewalk did not previously exist shall be 5 feet. No slab shall
be longer than 6 feet nor less than 4 feet.
   (m)   Finished Pavement Saw Cuts: Unless otherwise specified, all saw cut
joints in curb, gutter, and pavement shall be cut at a depth of 1/4 thickness
to allow for aggregate interlock (for example, 6 in. thick = cut of 1-1/2 in.).
   (n)   Backfill: After the concrete has set up and cured, 24 hours after
placement, the forms may be removed and the spaces along the edges of the walk
shall be backfilled immediately thereafter to the required elevation (1/2 in.
below the top of walk) and the surface shall be neatly graded.
   (o)   Curing: The wetted burlap method, layer of visquine, or properly
applied curing compound, will be used for curing and winter protection shall be
provided (for concrete less than 72 hours old, when temperature is 32° F or
lower) as required by Illinois Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction.
   (p)   Design: Design for all driveway approaches shall be approved by the
Public Works Director prior to issuance of a permit.
   (q)   Closing Drive Approaches: Existing drive approaches and curb cuts not
being utilized for new construction must be removed. In areas where a barrier
curb is the standard at the street, the curb and gutter at the approach must be
removed and a new barrier curb or similar style and dimensions must be
constructed.

event that the accepted bid or binds exceed the cost estimate for the work, the
amount assessed against each parcel of land shall be increased by apportioning
the total increase among the parcels by use of the formulas contained in
Section
1028.11 and acceptance of such bid or bids by the City Council shall constitute
a legislative finding that the amount assessed against each parcel of land is
fair, reasonable and proper. A majority vote of the elected members of Council
shall be required for acceptance of a bid or bids.
(1977 Code § 39-108; Ord. 94-80. Passed 9-19-94.)

the total final cost of the completed project. In the event of the approval of
the completed project and of the total final cost thereof, there shall be a
final assessment against each of the parcels of land and against the owners
thereof to be assessed for the project, and each owner shall be notified of the
amount finally assessed against him or her and shall be given the opportunity
to pay the same in one lump sum without interest or in ten equal annual
installments at the rate of ten percent per annum, payable annually. In the
event the owner elects to pay assessment in installments, the Finance Director
or his or her designee shall record with the County Recorder of Deeds a claim
for a lien on such parcel of land for the amount assessed against it.
(Ord. 97-21. Passed 7-21-97.)
1028.11 ASSESSMENT FORMULAS.
   All assessments shall be based on the actual total cost of the completed
project. Subject to the provisions of Section
1028.12, the following formulas shall be used in making assessments:
   (a)   Installation of Sanitary Sewers. In the installation of sanitary
sewers there shall be a public benefit assessed against the City in the amount
of five percent of the total cost of the project. The balance of the cost of
the project remaining after the public benefit assessment shall be assessed
against all parcels of real estate intended to be served by such improvement,
whether or not such parcels are contiguous to such improvement, and against the
owners of all such parcels. Each parcel of land to be assessed shall be
assigned a unit value, and the total cost of the project, after deduction of
the amount assessed to the City as public benefit, shall be divided by the
total number of units assigned to all of such parcels to determine the per unit
cost, and the number of units and fractions of units assigned to a parcel shall
be multiplied by the per unit cost to determine the assessment for that parcel.
Unit values shall be assigned as follows:
      (1)   A parcel which is improved with a structure for a one-family
detached dwelling unit shall be assessed as 1.00 units.
      (2)   A parcel which is improved with a structure or structures for two-
family dwelling units shall be assessed as 1.25 units.
      (3)   A parcel which is improved with a structure or structures for
multiple-family dwelling units shall be assessed as 1.35 units, plus .1 units
for each family dwelling unit over three which the structure or structures will
accommodate.
      (4)   Unimproved parcels which are zoned for a one-family detached
dwelling unit shall be assessed as 1.00 units.
      (5)   Unimproved parcels which are zoned for a structure or structures
for two-family dwelling units shall be assessed as 1.25 units.
      (6)   Unimproved parcels which are zoned for a structure or structures
for multiple-family dwelling units shall be assessed as 1.35 units, plus .1
units for each family dwelling unit over three up to and including the maximum
number of family dwelling units for which the parcel is zoned.
      (7)   A parcel which is improved with a non-dwelling unit structure or
building, whether the same be devoted to business, commercial, industrial,
church, school, clinics, offices or any other non-dwelling use will be assessed
in an equitable manner to be determined by the Board of Local Improvements
based upon the largest sewer use structure which could be placed on such parcel
under the existing zoning.
   (b)   Installation of Streets and Alleys; Improvements. The public benefit
to be charged the City in the installation of curbs and gutters for public
streets and alleys, the installation of streets and alleys or the improvement
of streets and alleys by grading, filling and surfacing, shall be for front
footage in crossing intersections, and the balance of the total cost of the
improvement shall be assessed on a front foot basis to each parcel of land,
improved or unimproved, contiguous to the local improvement.
   (c)   Installation of Storm Sewers. In the installation of storm sewers,
there shall be no public benefit charged to the City. The total cost of the
improvement shall be charged to each parcel of land, whether contiguous to the
improvement or not, which will be drained into the storm sewer on a percentage
basis of the drainage of the parcel in question as compared to the total
drainage for all parcels, whether or not contiguous to the local improvement,
to be drained into the storm sewer.
   (d)   Installation of Sidewalks on Public Ways or Public Street Rights of
Way. There shall be no public benefit charged against the City. The total cost
of the improvement shall be assessed on a front foot basis to each parcel of
land, improved or unimproved, contiguous to the local improvement.
   (e)   Installation of All Other Local Improvements. In the installation of
all other local improvements, there shall be no public benefit charge against
the City. The total cost of the improvement shall be assessed on a front foot
basis to each parcel of land, improved or unimproved, contiguous to the local
improvements. In the case of corner lots improved with a commercial building,
both sides of which corner lot front on the proposed improvement, the
assessment shall be based on the footage for the side on which the main
business entrance of the building fronts, and the other side shall not be
counted.

Ord. 88-25. Passed 5-16-88.)
1028.12 PUBLIC BENEFIT ASSESSMENTS.
   When local improvements are undertaken to benefit industry or commerce of
the City, the City may make a determination of the total maximum amount of the
benefit to the City of such local improvement by a finding made by Council. The
finding shall be set forth in the ordinance providing for the construction of
such local improvement, and it shall be the public benefit to be assessed for
the local improvement, and in such cases the assessment formulas for public
benefit set forth in Section
1028.11 shall not be applied.
(1977 Code § 39-111A; Ord. 88-25. Passed 5-16-88.)

the level of the sidewalk to the width of the adjacent parking space. The
parklet premises will be defined as a space no less than one space and no
greater than three parking spaces boarded by a removable barrier that can be of
a nature determined by the owner.
   (b)   A "sidewalk cafe" means any portion of an eating and drinking place
located on a public right-of-way that provides food or beverage service and is
either enclosed or unenclosed, operated by any inn, restaurant, eating place,
lunch counter, fast food outlet, catering service, coffee shop, diner, sandwich
shop, soda fountain, soft drink parlor, ice cream parlor, tea room,
delicatessen operation, hotel, motel or other facility licensed by the
Stephenson County Health Department where food and beverages are sold at retail
in the City, or where food is prepared for immediate consumption and sold by a
business which provides for on-premises consumption of said food, whether or
not such facility is situated in an established, permanent business location
and whether or not such facility is in connection with some other endeavor or
enterprise. The term "sidewalk cafe" does not include any drive-in restaurant,
buffet, movie theater, mobile food or beverage or ice cream vehicle, club,
public or private school or boarding house.
   (c)   No person shall establish or utilize an outdoor parklet or sidewalk
café without first having obtained a license from the City.
   (d)   Any person or business desiring to utilize both sidewalk and street
right-of-way shall be required to hold both sidewalk café and parklet licenses.

   (b)   The City Manager shall be entitled to seek the opinion and advice of

City official in his or her review of an application.
   (c)   The City Manager may, in his or her sole discretion, establish a
combined application for both outdoor parklets and sidewalk cafés for ease of

excuse the requirement of having separate licenses for any outdoor parklet or
sidewalk café, even if the boundaries of the areas are contiguous.

the applicant shall provide proof of dram shop insurance as required by Section

chapter. Failure of the permittee to maintain the required insurance for the
duration of the license shall result in the immediate revocation of said
license.
   (e)   A separate policy of insurance shall not be required under this
section if the general policy of insurance provided to satisfy the requirements
of Chapter 806 or Section
1026.17 of these Codified Ordinances specifically addresses the requirements of
this section. If the permittee has both a sidewalk café and parklet permit for
the same licensed location, separate policies shall not be required for each
permit, but the certificate provided shall provide coverage for all areas for
which any permits are issued.

conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            3.   The City shall document the basis for a denial, including the
specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
City denies an application.
            4.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the City
and resubmit the revised application once within thirty days after notice of
denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee.
The City shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty days after
the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit the revised application within thirty days of denial shall require the
application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the City's review period.
            5.   The applicant must notify the City in writing of its intention
to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
            6.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different

enter into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement.
      (3)   Completeness of application.
         A.   Within thirty days after receiving an application, the City shall
determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an
application is incomplete, the City must specifically identify the missing
information. An application shall be deemed complete if the City fails to
provide notification to the applicant within thirty days after all documents,
information and fees specifically enumerated in the City's permit application
form are submitted by the applicant to the City.
         B.   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the City sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.

         A.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the City;
or
         B.   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated applications.
         A.   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities
within the jurisdiction of the City shall be allowed, at the applicant's
discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to twenty-five small wireless facilities if the
collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless
facility and substantially the same type of structure.
         B.   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the City may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The City may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits.
         A.   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
City makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified
utility pole do not comply with the applicable City codes or any provision,
condition or requirement contained in this chapter.
         B.   If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein,
renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable City code provisions or
regulations in effect at the time of renewal.

on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including electronic mail.
   (c)   Collocation Requirements and Conditions.
      (1)   Public safety space reservation. The City may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the City's electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the City reasonably determines
that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      (2)   Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      (3)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies.

facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety
agency for public safety communications.
         B.   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency's communications equipment.
         C.   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         D.   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         E.   The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   A.   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on City utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
         B.   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the City utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         C.   For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms “communications
space”, “communication worker safety zone”, and “electric supply zone” have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      (6)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable

ordinance, written policy adopted by the City, a comprehensive plan or other
written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way,
including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      (7)   Alternate placements.
         A.   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and
conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that
the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
         B.   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
      (8)   Height limitations.
         A.   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the
small wireless facility is collocated.
         B.   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures
on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
City, provided the City may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in Title Four, including, but not limited to,
Chapter 1242 .
      (10)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the City and a

comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within sixty days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the City grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (d)   Application Fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on

from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the City
improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless
provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless provider has no
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as
may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the City or its employees or
agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have
against the City with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability.
(Ord. 2018-36. Passed 7-2-18.)
1036.06 INSURANCE.

wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the City evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage limits required by the City.

(1977 Code § 46-125)
1040.02 COMBINED BILLING PROCEDURES.
   (a)   All accrued rates and charges, including late fees or other associated
charges, for services and infrastructure provided by the City and as
established pursuant to
Chapter 1044 (Water Rates and Revenues),
Chapter 1048 (Sewer Rates and Revenues),
Chapter 1052 (Water and Sewer Capital Improvement Fund), and
Chapter 1060 (Garbage and Rubbish Collection and Removal) shall be billed in a
combined statement, as part of a single bill, at least monthly. The bill
submitted under this subsection (a) shall be referred to as the "aggregate
bill".
   (b)   Each aggregate bill shall state a date for payment thereof, which date
shall be not less than fifteen days from the date of mailing thereof. If
payment in full is not made on or before 5:00 p.m. CST/CDT on the date so
specified, a late fee of ten percent of the aggregate bill, or any portion
thereof remaining outstanding, shall be added to the amount owed. A payment
shall be deemed made on the earlier of (1) actual receipt of payment by the
City, or (2) the date payment is placed in the U.S. Mail, first class, postage
prepaid, properly addressed, as determined exclusively by the postmark affixed
by the U.S. Post Office.
   (c)   If any amounts due pursuant to an aggregate bill, including any late
charges due thereupon, remain unpaid for a period of ten days after the due
date set forth on the aggregate bill, the City shall mail to the customer, at
the customer's billing address, and if the customer is a renter, then also to
the property owner in the manner set forth below in this subsection (c), a
notice of delinquency specifying a date by which the delinquent aggregate bill
shall be paid or on which services will be discontinued, which date shall be
not less than fifteen days after the date of mailing thereof. The City shall
post, not less than five days prior to the date for disconnection, a notice at
the property specifying the date for disconnection, and advising the occupants
thereof that all municipal utility services will be disconnected on the date
specified unless payment in full is made of all past due amounts. For purposes
of providing notice of delinquency to the property owner as referenced above,
if the property is registered in the City's Landlord Registration Program, the
City shall send the notice to the property owner's contact information (address
or email) listed in the City's Landlord Registration Program. To the extent the
property is not registered in the City's Landlord Registration Program, the
City shall send notice to the last known address or email that the City has in
its records for the property owner.
   (d)   If any aggregate bill is not paid in full, including any late fees, on
or before the date specified for disconnection as set forth in a delinquency
notice, the City may discontinue services to the property at any time after the
date specified, without further notice. A service fee of fifty dollars ($50.00)
shall be charged for the disconnection.
   (e)   No service which has been disconnected shall be reconnected unless the
balance outstanding has been paid in full. The City may enter into a payment
arrangement for repayment of sums due in lieu of demanding immediate payment of
all sums due, and the City Manager may adopt procedures and policies for
implementation of any payment plans. Provided, that no provision hereof shall
be interpreted as requiring the City to enter into payment arrangements with
any person.
   (f)   To the extent a property owner is the delinquent customer on the
payment of a bill and the City desires to secure a lien on the property for
which service has been provided, the City shall send the delinquency notice
required in subsection (c) above to those parties required to be notified
pursuant to 65 ILCS 11-139-8, in the manner provided for therein, including the
property owner by certified mail. At any time thereafter, the City may file a
lien against the property for all past due payments without further notice to
any party. The City may, in its sole discretion, elect to aggregate multiple
delinquencies prior to filing such a lien.
   (g)   The City may take all steps permitted by State law to collect any
amounts due for services represented on the aggregate bill, including, but not
limited to, the use of private collection firms, recourse to State Income Tax
refunds, and such other and further relief as may be available to the City.

1040.03 APPLICATION FOR COMBINED MUNICIPAL SERVICES.
   (a)   All applications for combined municipal services shall be made on
forms provided by City. Upon acceptance of any application by the City, such
application shall constitute a contract between the applicant and the City
obligating the applicant to pay for all combined municipal services.
   (b)   A new application shall be made, subject to approval by the City, upon
any change in tenancy or property ownership where service is contracted for
combined municipal services. The property owner shall not be responsible for
any delinquent bill that is in a tenant's name. The City shall not record any
lien against the property for delinquent tenant bills. When any user change is
made on the account without giving the City notice, the new user shall be held
responsible for payment for all water service from the most recent meter
reading. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in
situations where a rental property is vacant (i.e. no tenant occupying the
rental property) or a situation where a rental property has had the water shut
off by the City, the property owner shall be responsible for any Public
Infrastructure Capital Improvement Fund fees assessed by the City.

   (a)   When application is made for a new consumer account, a deposit shall
be required per a posted schedule, as approved by the Manager from time to
time, to secure payment of the aggregate bill. The deposit may be retained by
the City so long as the applicant receives municipal utility services, unless
financial responsibility is established, which shall be defined as twelve
consecutive months of timely payments of the monthly water and sewer bill, in
which case said deposit shall be returned.
   (b)   For existing accounts, interest shall stop accruing on the deposit as

another shall be given no further municipal utility services until all
delinquent bills or charges due the City, for which he or she is in any way
responsible, are paid in full. If such service has been started inadvertently,
it may be turned off until settlement of such delinquent bills is made, and in
that event a charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) will be made for such
disconnection.
(Ord. 2018-11. Passed 3-5-18.)
1040.06 VOLUNTARY DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   A customer desiring to discontinue municipal utility services shall give
written notice to the City, specifying a future date on which the service is to
be discontinued and billing is to cease. The City's Water and Sewer Department

1042.05 REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF SERVICE PIPE CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Maintenance and repairs of an approved service connection will be made
by, and at the expense of, the Water and Sewer Department. If the service pipe,
gate valve or curb stop is leaking, it may be repaired or replaced at the
discretion of the Department. When it is advisable, in the judgment of the
Department, to replace or renew an approved service connection, the work will
be done by and at the expense of the Department. Existing service connections
which are doubled at the curb may be renewed with two single connections, at
the discretion of the Department.
   (b)   If a service connection is replaced or renewed at the request of the
owner for the purpose of providing a larger water supply, or for some other
purpose, the Department will install the service connection at the cost of the
owner. If a new connection is installed at the request of the owner in a
different location, the existing connection shall be cut off at the main at the
expense of the owner.
   (c)   Whenever the service pipe from the main to the curb line or to, and

the cost charged to either the property owner or the party responsible for the
damage.
   (d)   Any defect in the service from the curb, or the curb stop, to the
property or the meter shall be repaired by the owner. When such defects are
discovered, the customer or owner will be notified, and if such defects are not
repaired within a reasonable time, the water may be turned off, with or without
further notice.
   (e)   The Department will use care in its operation or use of the curb stop
or gate valve, but it shall not be liable if the service pipe from the curb, or
from the curb stop into the premises, is broken or damaged in turning on or
turning off water for repairs, nonpayment of bills or for any other reason.
   (f)   Neither the City nor the Department shall be responsible, by reason of
failure in the supply of water, for the breaking of any service pipe, apparatus
or water coil.

1042.11 LIABILITY OF WATER AND SEWER DEPARTMENT FOR DAMAGES.
   In turning on water for any reason, the Water and Sewer Department may
assume that the piping and fixtures which the service will supply are in order
to receive service, and it shall not be responsible for any accident, break,
leakage or damage which may occur by reason of improper fixtures, open or
improper connections or for any other reason.
(1977 Code § 71-211; Ord. 89-81. Passed 12-18-89.)
1042.12 METERS GENERALLY.
   (a)   The Water and Sewer Department shall determine the size of the meter
suitable for the service requested.
   (b)   All water shall be metered, and the bills rendered to the customer, at
rates established by ordinance. The Department, at its option, may place and
maintain a meter upon the service pipe of any customer and furnish such supply
at meter rates.
   (c)   If, at the request and for the convenience of the owner of a tract
containing more than one building or unit, and with the approval of the
Manager, water is furnished to such property through a single meter for the
purpose of redistribution to the several buildings or units, the size of each
block in the applicable rate schedule shall be multiplied by the number of
buildings or units served through such single meter. For such premises the
minimum bill or charge set forth in the applicable rate schedule for a five-
eighths inch meter shall be multiplied by the number of buildings or units
served, and the product thereof shall be the minimum bill for such tract.
   (d)   All meters shall be furnished and set by the Department, but owners
shall provide a suitable location thereof. Meters shall be placed in a
horizontal position on the service pipe, not to exceed two feet from the wall
where such pipe enters the building. If the piping will not accommodate a meter
in a horizontal position, the Department may refuse to place a meter until the
piping is changed to permit a horizontal setting.
   (e)   There shall be a stop and waste between each meter and the wall and a
suitable place provided for the meter so as to keep it dry, clean and readily
accessible to employees of the Department. A valve shall be placed on the pipe
on the outlet side of each meter not more than three feet from the meter. All
valves and fittings necessary to comply with these requirements and to provide
connection to the meter, except a coupling or flange at each end of the meter,
shall be provided by the owner.
   (f)   Where a meter, or meters, of two inches or larger diameter are
desired, the owner, or his or her plumber, shall obtain instructions from the
Department regarding the fitting and space to be provided. In addition, the
City reserves the right to request calculations for the need of a meter two
inches or larger and upon such review retains the right to have installed two
or more meters of smaller size.
   (g)   In the case that two or more meters are desired for measuring water to
different tenants in the same building from one service connection, they shall
be placed so that not one of them shall measure water that has passed through
another meter.
   (h)   A suitable check valve shall be placed on the outlet side of the
meter, if required by the Department. If a check valve is required, a safety
valve should be inserted on the house piping to relieve any excess pressure due
to heating water.
   (i)   Wherever necessary, in order to meter the entire supply or to protect
the meter, the Department may require that the meter be installed in an
underground chamber or patent meter box approved by the Department. The
installation of the chamber or meter box shall be made by, and at the expense
of, the owner.
   (j)   All private service connections with the City water supply hereafter
installed shall include a remote recording device installed at a convenient
location on the exterior of the structure served by the water service
connection, to register the volume of water passing through the water meter.
The remote recording device shall be furnished by the City and shall remain the
property of the City.
   (k)   The customer shall be responsible for the care and protection of the
meter from freezing, hot water damage and any other injury or interference from
any person. For all such damage, necessary repairs shall be made by the
Department and the cost billed to the customer. If payment is neglected or
refused, the water service may be turned off until payment of the damages, plus
fifty dollars ($50.00) for turning on the service, is made. Damaged meters may
be repaired without notice to the customer.
   (l)   No one shall interfere with the proper registration of a water meter,
and no one, except an authorized employee of the Department, shall break the
seal of a meter. However, the Manager may permit licensed plumbers, in case of
emergency, to break the seal for draining pipes or stopping water leaks.
   (m)   No one shall interfere with the remote reading device or associated
appurtenances, and no one, except an authorized employee of the Department,
shall remove, make repairs, or replace said remote reading device or associated
appurtenances.

Ord. 2017-12. Passed 3-6-17.)
1042.13 TESTING OF METERS; REPLACEMENT OF DAMAGED METERS.
   (a)   The Water and Sewer Department may remove and test any meter, at any
time, and substitute another meter in its place.
   (b)   No meter shall be placed or allowed to remain in service if its
average accuracy of registration, as defined by the standard practices of the
American Water Works Association, is known to be more than two percent over or
under 100 percent.
   (c)   The Department shall not be liable for broken or leaking pipes or
damage to any plumbing or fixtures resulting from the changing of the meter.
The owner shall maintain the pipes, fixtures and plumbing in such repair that a
meter may be removed or installed at any time.

1042.15 BILLING AND COLLECTIONS
   Billings and collection of charges established by this chapter shall be
billed in the manner provided for aggregate billing as set forth in
Chapter 1040 (Utilities Generally) of these Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 99-60. Passed 11-1-99; Ord. 2016-26. Passed 4-4-16; Ord. 2017-12. Passed
3-6-17; Ord. 2018-11. Passed 3-5-18.)
1042.16 ESTIMATED BILLING.
   (a)   The quantity recorded by the meter shall be conclusive to both the
customer and the Water and Sewer Department unless the meter is found to be
registering inaccurately or has ceased to register. In such cases, the quantity
may be determined by the registration of an accurate meter in a corresponding
past or future period, whichever period is representative, in the Department's
discretion, of the condition existing during the period of inaccuracy.
   (b)   When a meter cannot be read on a regular reading date, the Department
may render a bill based on previous meter readings. When the meter is
subsequently read, any differences between the estimated and actual consumption
will be adjusted.
(1977 Code § 71-216; Ord. 89-81. Passed 12-18-89.)
1042.17 CONNECTIONS FOR PRIVATE FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES.
   (a)   Application may be made to the Water and Sewer Department for a
private fire connection by the owner of any premises, in writing, accompanied
by complete and correct drawings showing the location of the premises and of
all water pipes, hydrants, tanks, sprinkler heads and other appurtenances on
the premises. The plans shall remain the property of the Department.
   (b)   Such application shall be approved, and the service installed, only
where practical and convenient, in the sole discretion of the Department.
   (c)   All fire service connections shall be installed by the Department from
the water main to the curb line.

main. The owner shall install a gate valve with an indicator post at the curb
or property line. A detector check valve tapped for by-passing the check valve
and a rising stem gate valve on the system side of the check valve shall be
installed, by and at the owner's expense, where and immediately after the
supply pipe enters the premises. The type and make of the detector check valve
shall be subject to the approval of the Department.
   (e)   The applicant shall pay the cost of the installation of such fire
service connections, plus twenty percent additional to cover overhead expense.
All repairs to the service pipe between the street main and the curb line shall
be made by, and at the expense of, the Department.
   (f)   The Department may limit the size of fire protection service where the
street mains are such as to make it necessary to protect the public. If more
than one service is installed to the same premises, the piping system of one
shall not be connected with the system of the other except by special
permission of the City Council.
   (g)   No private fire protection service line shall be larger than twelve
inches in diameter.
   (h)   Failure to pay the cost of installing the fire service within thirty
days after the date of the bill will be sufficient cause for turning off the
water in the service.
   (i)   The connection shall be used for fire purposes only, shall have no
connection whatever with any taps used for other than fire purposes, and,
because of the danger of pollution, shall have no connection with any other
source of supply.
   (j)   The customer shall permit no water to be drawn through this connection
for any purpose other than the extinguishment of fires or the periodic testing
of the fire system.

of all tests, so that, if desired, the Department may have a representative
present. Such notification need not be formal, but may be given by telephone to
the office of the Manager.
   (l)   Any authorized representative of the Department shall have free access
to any building, at any reasonable time, for the purpose of inspecting the
service connections, piping and appurtenances.
   (m)   The Department may, at any time, set a meter on the connection, which
will meet requirements of insurance companies. If a meter is installed, the
established rates, including both water and service charges, will apply, but
nothing herein shall be construed as compelling the Department to install a
meter. The Department shall designate the size and number of meters necessary
for water service other than for private fire protection through hose
connections, and the property owner may request the additional meter or meters
that might be necessary because of hose connections for private fire protection
service.
   (n)   Private fire protection service will be supplied subject to the right
of the City to use water in the street mains, through hydrants, for fire
purposes. The Department may shut off the supply at any time in case of
accident, or to make alterations, extensions, connections or repairs. There
shall be no guarantee as to pressure in the service connection, pipe or main
supplying the same, and the Department shall not be liable for loss or damage
to the customer for deficiency or failure in the supply of water, whether
occasioned by accident, alterations, extensions, connections, repairs or any
cause whatsoever.
   (o)   If the water is shut off, or there is a deficiency or failure in the
supply from any cause, continuing for two days or more, the customer shall be
entitled to a pro rata credit on the regular bill.
   (p)   Violation of any conditions, rules or regulations shall entitle the
Department, at its option, to discontinue the fire service connection and shut
off the service without notice. A waiver of any violation shall not be
construed as a waiver of subsequent violations.

presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with
this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to Freeport. Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of paragraph B. of this section are met.
      B.   Criteria.
         1.   Either (i) the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be
applied on a net basis; or (ii) the industrial user demonstrates that the
control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the
absence of pollutants in the intake waters.
         2.   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         3.   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
         4.   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. Freeport may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.

         1.   The building, structure, facility or installation is constructed
at a site at which no other source is located;
         2.   The building, structure, facility or installation totally
replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of
pollutants at an existing source; or
         3.   The production or wastewater generating processes of the
building, structure, facility or installation are substantially independent of
an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors, such as the extent to which the new
facility is integrated with the existing plant and the extent to which the new
facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing
source, should be considered.
      B.   Construction on a site at which an existing source is located
results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not
create a new building, structure, facility or installation meeting the criteria
of paragraph A.2. or 3. above but otherwise alters, replaces or adds to
existing process or production equipment.
      C.   Construction of a new source, as defined in this subsection, has
commenced if the owner or operator has begun, or caused to begin as part of a
continuous on-site construction program, any placement, assembly or
installation of facilities or equipment, or significant site-preparation work,
including clearing, excavation or removal of existing buildings, structures or
facilities which is necessary for the placement, assembly or installation of
new source facilities or equipment; or if the owner or operator has entered
into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities or
equipment which are intended to be used in its operation within a reasonable
time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be terminated or modified
without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility, engineering and design

specifically included in the pretreatment standard) and the following
conditions are met:
      A.   The industrial user, prior Freeport's finding, has consistently
complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards and
requirements;
      B.   The industrial user annually submits the certification statement

required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be
properly provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. All
industrial users shall obtain all necessary construction operating permits from
the IEPA. Such pretreatment facilities shall be under the control and direction
of an IEPA certified wastewater treatment plant operator. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division for review, and shall be
acceptable to the City or its authorized designee before such facilities are
constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of
this chapter.
   (b)   All public and industrial users shall provide grease, oil and sand
traps or interceptors when, in the opinion of the Plumbing Inspector, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid waste with excessive amounts of
grease, oil or sand. All traps or interceptors shall be of a type and size
approved by the City or its authorized designee and shall be located so as to
be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. They shall be operated,
cleaned and maintained in a manner acceptable to the City or its authorized
designee.
   (c)   Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary,
the following regulations shall apply to food service establishments.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this subsection (c) is to set forth
policies, procedures, and requirements for food service establishments
governing the installation, maintenance, and use of grease traps, grease
interceptors or other comparable devices which represent the best practicable
control technology for oil/grease removal, and to establish procedures
regarding implementation and enforcement of the regulations set forth in this
subsection.

and/or sells food for consumption either on or off the premises, including, but
not limited to, restaurants, sandwich shops, delicatessens, bakeries, conveince
stores or pizzerias. The term, as used in this subsection, does not refer to
food stores or establishments that do not prepare food on premises or process
food in a manner so as to contribute grease to the sewer system.
         B.   "Grease interceptor" means a device designed and installed to
separate and retain deleterious, hazardous, or undesirable matter from normal
wastes and to permit normal sewage or liquid wastes to discharge into the
disposal terminal by gravity.
         C.   "Grease trap" means a device designed to retain grease from one
to a maximum of four fixtures.
      (3)   Requirement for grease trap, grease interceptor, or other device.

grease, oil or other similar material shall have an operable grease trap,
grease interceptor or other comparable device(s) as determined by the City of
Freeport, or by the City's authorized designee, to be an adequate substitute
for a grease trap or grease interceptor. A properly sized interceptor or trap
shall be considered first. Grease and oil interceptors or traps shall be
provided at the cost of the owner.
         B.   All drains from food preparation and cleanup areas including, but
not limited to, prewash sinks, floor drains, food waste disposal units, pots
and pans sinks, scullery sinks, and garbage can wash areas shall be connected
to such trap or interceptor. Grease traps required by this chapter shall be no
smaller than an 80-gallon capacity trap with a 75-gallon per minute flow rate.
         C.   Existing grease traps, grease interceptors or similar devices.

after January 1, 1997, installed grease traps, grease interceptors, or other
grease pretreatment equipment shall not be required to upgrade such equipment,
so long as such equipment remains in good working order. Should the grease
trap, grease interceptor or other grease pretreatment equipment become
nonoperational or fail to operate in good working order, a grease trap or
grease interceptor meeting the standards set forth in this subsection shall be
immediately installed.
            2.   Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (c)(3)C.1. above, any
food service establishment or other business that, on or after, January 1,
1997, installed grease traps, grease interceptors, or other grease pretreatment
equipment shall upgrade such equipment to meet the standards set forth in this
subsection upon the change of ownership of the business in which the equipment
is located, or upon the remodeling of the business in which the equipment is
located. Remodeling of the business not requiring a building permit shall be
exempted from the upgrade requirement. The remodeling shall not be separated
into phases for the purpose of avoiding the requirement of a building permit.
      (4)   General regulations and procedures.
         A.   When waste treatment is required pursuant to this subsection, an
approved grease trap or grease interceptor complying with the provision of this
subsection shall be installed in the waste line leading from sinks, drains, and
other fixtures or equipment.

1046.14 ACCIDENTAL/SLUG DISCHARGE/REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (a)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division of the
incident. The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location,
the time and the type, concentration and volume of wastewater, if known, and
any corrective actions taken by the user.
   (b)   Within five days following such a discharge, the industrial user,
unless waived by the City Manager, or his/her authorized designee, shall submit
to the City a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and
the measures taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Follow-up
reports may be required by the City Manager, or his/her authorized designee as
needed. Such report or reports shall not relieve the industrial user of any
expense, loss, damages, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor
shall such report or reports relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to
report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other
remedies available to the City, result in the termination of the industrial
user's wastewater discharge permit and/or revocation of the discharger’s
wastewater discharge and potable water use privileges.
   (c)   The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure to its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced or lost or fails.
   (d)   A notice in English and the language of common use shall be
permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in
subsection (a) above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who are in a
position to cause, discover or observe such discharge are advised of the
emergency notification procedures.
   (e)   Each industrial user having the ability to cause interference and pass
through to the POTW treatment plant or to violate the regulatory provisions of
this chapter shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the owner's or user's own expense.
   (f)   All industrial users whose wastewater includes or could include
compatible or incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause
interference with the POTW must have detailed plans on file with the Department
of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide protection from accidental discharge. No user who begins
contributing such pollutants to, or could contribute such pollutants to, the
POTW, after the effective date of this chapter, shall be permitted to introduce
such pollutants into the POTW until accidental discharge facilities and
procedures, as appropriate, have been approved by the City Manager or his/her
authorized designee and installed by the industrial user. Review and approval
of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (g)   Slug Plans: The Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division
shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug
discharges. The City Manager or his/her designee may require any user to
develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other
action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. All significant
industrial users will be evaluated within one year after the effective date of
this chapter and additional SIU’s will be evaluated within one year of being
designated as an SIU. If the City Manager or his/her designee decides that an
accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan is needed, the plan shall
contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges.
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals.
      (3)   The industrial users procedures for immediately notifying the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division of any accidental or slug
discharge, including any discharge that would violate the prohibitive discharge
standards as found in Section
1046.09.
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (h)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Department of
Public Works - Water and Sewer Division immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

   All industrial users shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing,
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Notification shall be
according to 40 CFR 403.12(p).
(Ord. 96-68. Passed 10-7-96.)
1046.16 CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   Each user shall notify the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer
Division thirty days in advance of any significant changes to the user's
operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its
wastewater. For the purposes of this requirement, significant changes include,
but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent or greater and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
   (a)   The City Manager or his/her authorized designee may require the user
to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under Section
1046.21.

the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division within twenty-four
hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division within thirty days after
becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not
required if the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division performs
sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the Department of
Public Works - Water and Sewer Division performs sampling at the user between
the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or
the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division receives the results
of this sampling, or if the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer
Division has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial
user.

1046.18 BYPASSES/UPSETS.
   (a)   Bypasses:
      (1)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is also
for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. Such bypasses are not
subject to the provisions of subsections (b) through (e) hereof.
      (2)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the City, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (3)   A user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Department of Public Works -
Water and Sewer Division within twenty-four hours from the time it becomes
aware of such bypass. A written submission shall be provided within five days
of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The City Manager, or
his/her designee may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the
oral report has been received within twenty-four hours.
      (4)   Bypass is prohibited, and the City may take enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         A.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass; such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of downtime. This condition is not satisfied
if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         C.   The user submitted notices as provided in subsections (b) and (c)
hereof.
      (5)   The Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division may
approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (a)(4) hereof.
   (b)   Upsets:
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless
or improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of paragraph (b)(3) below are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         B.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         C.   The user has submitted the following information to the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division within twenty-four hours
of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a
written submission must be provided within five days):
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim if upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

1046.19 LOCAL AND NATIONAL PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   In General. Two types of pretreatment may be required by the City. The
first type, hereinafter known as local pretreatment requirements, refers to the
pretreatment standards which apply to the "end of pipe" of an industrial user
where its wastewater discharges into the sanitary sewer. These standards are
set forth herein in Sections
1046.09  and
1046.10 . The second type, hereinafter known as the national categorical
pretreatment requirements, are for standards which have been or may be
promulgated in accordance with Sections 307(b) and (c) of the Act.
   (b)   Local Pretreatment Requirements. With respect to any industrial user
which discharges or proposes to discharge wastewater to the sanitary sewer
which contains a substance or possesses the characteristics enumerated in some
or all of Sections
1046.09  and
1046.10  and which, in the judgment of the Department of Public Works - Water
and Sewer Division, may cause pass through or interference, the Department of
Public Works - Water and Sewer Division may:
      (1)   Deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants, or
changes in nature of pollutants, to the POTW by industrial users where such
contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements or
where such contributions would cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit.
      (2)   Require compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
      (3)   Require the development of a compliance schedule by each industrial
user for the installation of technology required to meet applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. Compliance schedules shall contain the
information requested in Section
1046.20(a)(8).
      (4)   Require that the industrial user submit information on the nature
and characteristics of its wastewater including all notices and self-monitoring
reports which are necessary to assess and assure compliance with pretreatment
standards and requirements.
      (5)   Require that an industrial user develop accidental discharge/slug
control plans and/or facilities. Requirements and procedures are listed in
Section
1046.14.
      (6)   Require that an industrial user apply for a wastewater discharge
permit from the City. Permit requirements are listed in Section
1046.21.
   If the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division requires
pretreatment or equalization of flows, the design and installation of the plant
and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Manager
or his/her authorized designee and State regulatory agencies and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. Compulsory
compliance procedures, as set forth in Section
1046.26, shall be applicable in the event that any industrial user violates any
local requirements or standards.
   (c)   National Categorical Pretreatment Requirements. National categorical
pretreatment requirements shall apply to all significant industrial users
subject to national categorical pretreatment standards which have been
promulgated by the USEPA in accordance with Section 307(a) and (c) of the Act,
currently discharging or scheduled to discharge to the City. Compliance with
the national categorical pretreatment standards is mandatory. Significant
industrial users shall comply with the State or local pretreatment requirements
and standards in the event that such requirements and standards are more
stringent than the categorical standards.

1046.20 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CATEGORICAL/NONCATEGORICAL DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Baseline Report for Categorical Discharges Only.
      (1)   Industrial users subject to National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards shall submit baseline reports to the Department of Public Works -
Water and Sewer Division in a form prescribed and furnished by the Department
of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division.
      (2)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administration decision on a categorical
determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to the POTW shall submit to the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer
Division a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (a)(4)
and (5) below.
      (3)   At least ninety days prior to the commencement of their discharge,
new sources and sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to
the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard shall submit to the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division a report which contains
the information listed in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) below. A new source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
      (4)   In support of the baseline report, the industrial users described
above shall submit, in units and terms specified in the application, the
following information:
         A.   Identifying information: The name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owner.

process diagram indicating points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated
process.
         D.   Flow measurement: Information showing the measured average daily
and maximum daily flow to the POTW, in gallons per day, from each of the
following:
            1.   Regulated process streams; and
            2.   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e).
      (5)   The industrial user shall identify the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards applicable to each regulated process and any new
categorically regulated processes for existing sources and shall:
         A.   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by standard or by the
City, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process.
Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term average concentrations, or mass,
where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in
Section
1046.23. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with Best
Management Practices (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall
submit documentation as required by the City or the applicable standards to
determine compliance with the standard.
         B.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
Section
1046.23.
         C.   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
The samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities
if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula in
40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where
an alternative concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit, along with supporting data, shall be
submitted to the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division.
         D.   Submit, only with the City Manager or his/her authorized
designee's authorization, a baseline report which utilizes only historical
data, so long as such data provide information sufficient to determine the need
for industrial pretreatment measures.
         E.   Provide, for each baseline report, the time, date and place of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and certification that such sampling and
analysis are representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
      (6)   The industrial user shall provide a statement, reviewed by the
authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance
(O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to
meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
      (7)   If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the
pretreatment standards, the industrial user will provide the shortest schedule
which will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date
in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for
the applicable pretreatment standards.
         A.   Where the industrial user's National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7) or combined
waste stream formula (40 CFR 403.15), at the time the industrial user submits a
baseline report, the information required in paragraph (a)(6) hereof and this
paragraph (a)(7) shall pertain to the modified limits.
         B.   If the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard for the
industrial user is modified after the baseline report is submitted, the
industrial user shall make any necessary amendments to information provided as
a response to paragraph (a)(6) hereof and this paragraph (a)(7) and submit them
to the City within sixty days after the modified standard is approved.
      (8)   The following conditions shall apply to any schedule submitted in
response to paragraph (a)(7) hereof:
         A.   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction and beginning and conducting routine operation).
         B.   No increment referred to in paragraph (a)(8)A. hereof shall
exceed nine months.
         C.   The user shall submit a progress report to the Department of
Public Works - Water and Sewer Division no later than fourteen days following
each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, including, as a
minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on
such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule. In no event
shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division.
      (9)   All baseline monitoring reports must be signed by an authorized
representative as defined in Section
1046.07(2) and certified in accordance with Section
1046.68.
   (b)   Compliance Date Report (for Significant Users). Within ninety days
following compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in
the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer
Division a report, on forms provided by the City, indicating the nature and
concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process
which are limited by pretreatment standards, and the average and maximum daily
flow for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional user operation and maintenance or pretreatment techniques or
installations are necessary to bring the user into compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards. The report shall be certified by a qualified
professional and be signed and certified according to Section 1046.68.
   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the City in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-
term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All sampling
will be done in conformance with Section
1046.23.
   (c)   Periodic Compliance Reports. (All SIU's are required to submit
periodic compliance reports including those that have been designated as
nonsignificant categorical industrial users).
      (1)   All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by
the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division submit no less than
twice a year (June and December or on dates specified) reports indicating the
nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard
requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      (2)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with Section
1046.68.
      (3)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (4)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer
Division using the procedures prescribed in Section
1046.23, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

      (4)   Permit modification. The City may modify the permit for good cause,
including, but not limited to, the following:
         A.   To incorporate any new Federal, State or local pretreatment
requirements or standards.
         B.   Material or substantial alterations or additions to the
discharger's operation processes or discharge volume or character which were
not considered in drafting the effective permit.
         C.   A change in any condition in either the industrial user or the
POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of
the authorized discharge.
         D.   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a
threat to the City's collection and treatment systems, POTW personnel or the
receiving waters.
         E.   Violation of any terms or conditions of the permit.
         F.   Misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts
in the permit application or in any required reporting.
         G.   Revision of or grant of a variance from categorical standards
pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13.
         H.   To correct typographical or other errors in the permit.
         I.   To reflect transfer of the facility ownership and/or operation to
a new owner and/or operator.
         J.   Upon request of the permittee, provided such request does not
create a violation of any applicable requirements, standards, laws or rules and
regulations.
         The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification,
revocation or termination, or notification of planned changes or anticipated
noncompliance, does not stay any permit condition.
      (5)   Permit transfer. Permits may be reassigned or transferred to a new
owner and/or operator with prior approval of the City Manager, provided the
permittee has given at least thirty days' notice to the Department of Public
Works - Water and Sewer Division. The notice must include a written
certification by the new owner which states that the new owner has no immediate
plans to change the facility's operations and processes. The owner must also
identify the specific date on which the transfer occurs and include a statement
acknowledging full responsibility for complying with the existing permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the permit void as of
the date of facility transfer.
      (6)   Permit reissuance. The industrial user shall apply for permit
reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with
subsection (b) hereof, a minimum of ninety days prior to the expiration of the
user's existing permit.
      (7)   Continuation of expired permits. An expired permit will continue to
be effective and enforceable until the permit is reissued if:
         A.   The industrial user has submitted a complete permit application
at least ninety days prior to the expiration date of the user's existing
permit.
         B.   The failure to reissue the permit, prior to expiration of the
previous permit, is not due to any act or failure to act on the part of the
industrial user.
      (8)   Wastewater haulers' permits. Septic tank waste may be introduced
into the POTW only at locations designated by the City, and at such times as
established by the City. Such waste shall not violate Sections
1046.09  and
1046.10  or any other requirements established by the City of Freeport. The
City may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain a wastewater discharge
permit. The Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division may also
collect samples of each hauled load and require completion of a waste-tracking
form for each load. Wastes from industrial or commercial sources are prohibited
and may not be discharged by a hauler to the sanitary sewer system. Discharge
of such non-septic wastes into the sanitary sewer system will constitute a
violation of this chapter and subject the hauler to penalties.

1046.22 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (a)   The City shall require to be provided and operated, at the significant
industrial user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage
systems. The monitoring facility will normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical and cause
undue hardship to the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping, parked vehicles or other activities of the user.
   (b)   Where required by the City, additional control manholes or sampling
chambers shall be provided at the end of each industrial process within an
industrial user's facility suitable for the determination of compliance with
pretreatment standards.
   (c)   Whenever required, any significant industrial user shall install a
large manhole or sampling chamber for each separate discharge in the building
sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the POTW,
installed and maintained at all times at the user's expense, which shall have
ample room in each sampling chamber to permit the Department of Public Works -
Water and Sewer Division to take accurate composite samples for analyses. The
chamber shall be safely, easily and independently accessible to authorized
representatives of the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division at
any time.
   Each sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer-Bowlus flume unless a weir or
similar device is approved by the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer
Division with a recording and totalizing register for the measurement of the
liquid quantity, or, at the discretion of the POTW, the metered water supply to
the industrial plant may be used as the liquid quantity where it is
substantiated to the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division that
the metered water supply and waste water quantities are approximately the same,
or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the Department of Public Works -
Water and Sewer Division is made in the metered water supply to determine the
liquid waste quantity.
   (d)   When required, samples shall be taken every hour or half hour, as
determined by the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division, and
properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance with subsection (e) hereof
and shall be composited in proportion to the flow for a representative twenty-
four-hour sample.
   (e)   All measurements, tests, sampling and analyses required by this
chapter shall be performed in accordance with the procedures established by the
USEPA Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40
CFR Part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures
approved by the Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques approved by the Administrator. Where 40 CFR Part 136, does not
include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or
where the Administrator determines that Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW
or other parties, approved by the Administrator.

1046.23 INSPECTIONS, SAMPLING AND RECORDS.
   (a)   The Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division shall have
the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is
complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Department of Public
Works - Water and Sewer Division ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties. Where a user has security measures in
force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Department of Public
Works - Water and Sewer Division will be permitted to enter without delay for
the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. Unreasonable delays in
allowing the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division access to
the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
   (b)   The Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division shall have
the right to set up on the user's property, or to require installation of, such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's
operations. The City may require the user to install monitoring equipment
according to Section 1046.22. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment
shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by
the user at its own expense. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and
easy access to the facility to be inspected or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Department of
Public Works - Water and Sewer Division and shall not be replaced. The cost of
clearing such access shall be borne by the user. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least semi-annually to
ensure their accuracy.
   (c)   Except as indicated in subsection (d) and (e) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer
Division. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division, the
samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may
be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and
sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
   (d)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (e)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day
compliance reports required in Section 1046.20(a) and (b) (40 CFR 403.12(b) and
(d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total
phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which
historical sampling data are available, the Department of Public Works - Water
and Sewer Division may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by
Section 1046.20 (c) (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is
required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (f)   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under
Section 1046.10(c) Records shall include;
      (1)   The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the names of
the person or persons taking the samples;
      (2)   The dates analyses were performed;
      (3)   Who performed the analyses;
      (4)   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
      (5)   The results of such analyses.
   (g)   The Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division and
industrial users shall maintain such records for a minimum of three years. This
period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved
litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial user or the
operation of the City's pretreatment program or when requested by the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division, Regional Administrator
or the Director of the IEPA.
   (h)   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.

1046.24 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from inspections and sampling activities conducted by the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division, shall be available to
the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests
confidentiality and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division that the release of such
information would divulge information relative to processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law.
Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information
or data. When demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which may
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES Program or Pretreatment
Program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
defined by 40 CFR 2.302, will not be recognized as confidential information and
will be available to the public without restriction.

1046.25 PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The City shall publish annually, in the daily newspaper with the greatest
circulation in the City of Freeport, a list of users which, during the previous
twelve months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
(Ord. 96-68. Passed 10-7-96; Ord. 2017-45. Passed 6-5-17.)
1046.26 COMPULSORY COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. When the City finds that an industrial user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or an order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the City may serve upon that user a written notice of
violation. Within ten days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the City.
Submission of this plan in no way releases the user of liability for any
violations occuring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing
in this section shall limit the authority of the City to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action without first
issuing a notice of violation.
   (b)   Consent Orders. The City may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with
any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to subsection (d) hereof and
may be judicially enforced.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing. The City may order a user which has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the City and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user
specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user. The show cause hearing shall not be
a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking action against the user.
   (d)   Compliance Orders. When the City finds that a user has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or an order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the City may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or
other appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may
also contain other requirements to address noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amounts of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking other action against the user.
   (e)   Cease and Desist Orders. When the City finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are
likely to recur, the City Commission may issue an order to the user directing
it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.

1046.27 REJECTION OF WASTEWATER OR TERMINATION OF  PERMIT.
   (a)   Conditions for Rejection or Termination. A significant industrial user
is subject to having its wastewater discharge rejected or its wastewater
discharge permit terminated, in accordance with the procedures of this section,
for any violation of this chapter, an order issued pursuant to Section
1046.26 (d), the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, any Federal Act, or
regulations promulgated under either Act, or for any of the following:
      (1)   Failure of the industrial user to fully and accurately report the
wastewater constituents and characteristics of its wastewater discharge as
determined by analysis conducted by the industrial user or the Department of
Public Works - Water and Sewer Division;
      (2)   Failure of the industrial user to fully and accurately report
significant changes in process activity which could affect its wastewater
discharge or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the industrial user's premises by
the City's representatives for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
      (4)   Tampering with, disrupting or destroying the City equipment;
      (5)   Failure to report a slug load or accidental discharge of a
pollutant;
      (6)   Failure to report an upset of the industrial user's treatment
facilities; or
      (7)   Violations of conditions in the industrial user's wastewater
discharge permit or the limitations listed in Sections
1046.09 through
1046.11.
   (b)   Procedures for Rejection and/or Termination.
      (1)   The City may order any industrial user who causes or allows any
action which is subject to rejection or permit termination to show cause before
the City why its wastewater discharges should not be rejected and/or its
discharge permit not be terminated. A notice shall be served on the industrial
user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the City
regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken and the
proposed action, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the
City why its wastewater discharges should not be rejected or its permit
terminated. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by
registered mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the
hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer or a corporation.
      (2)   The City may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or
may designate the Utility Superintendent or the City Attorney to:
         A.   Issue, in the name of the City, notices of hearing requesting the
attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant
to any matter involved in such hearing;
         B.   Take the evidence;
         C.   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations, to the City for
action thereon.
      (3)   At any hearing held pursuant to this subsection, testimony taken
must be under oath and recorded stenographically or by tape recording. The
transcript of such hearing will be made available to any member of the public
or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual copying charges therefor.
      (4)   After the City has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to
the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing either:
         A.   That the wastewater discharge permit be terminated and/or that
the wastewater discharges be rejected and the service be disconnected; or
         B.   That following a specified time the wastewater permit will be
terminated and/or the wastewater discharges will be rejected unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been
installed and operated properly to comply with the pretreatment standards and
regulations and/or the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit; or
         C.   That the industrial user ceases the unauthorized discharge
effective after a specified period of time; or
         D.   That such other action be done as is deemed necessary by the City
to abate the discharge by the industrial user. Further orders and directives as
are necessary may be issued.
      (5)   Following an order of permit termination or rejection of its
wastewater discharges, the industrial user shall cease discharging to the POTW
in accordance with the terms in said order. Failure to do so shall be prima-
facie evidence of continuing harm to the POTW and provide grounds for the
granting of injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders.

1046.28 ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING DISCONNECTIONS.
   The City may, upon discovering an ongoing or potential discharge to the POTW
which presents or may present a danger to the environment or which threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, immediately issue an order to the
responsible industrial user to show cause before the City why the City should
not disconnect service, reject the industrial user's wastewater discharge,
terminate the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit, or seek injunctive
relief to prohibit the industrial user from making the discharge to the POTW.
Procedures to be followed by the City in said show cause hearing shall be in
accordance with Section
1046.27(b).

is subject to immediate disconnection of service under either of the following
conditions:
      (1)   Whenever immediate disconnection is required to halt or prevent any
discharge of pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appears to the Department
of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division to present an imminent endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons; or
      (2)   The Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division may also
immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which
presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment; or
      (3)   Whenever the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit is
terminated and/or its wastewater discharges are rejected.
   (b)   Procedures for Immediate Disconnection. Notwithstanding Sections
1046.27  and
1046.28 , the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division shall have
the authority, after informal notice to the industrial user, to immediately and
effectively halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants to the POTW that
reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons. When the Department of Public Works - Water and
Sewer Division determines that such an emergency situation exists, a verbal
order shall be issued (followed immediately by a written order) to the
industrial user stating the problem and requiring immediate cessation of the
discharge. Methods of informal notice shall include, but not be limited to, any
of the following: Personal conversation between the industrial user and the
Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division employees, telephone
calls, letters, hand-delivered messages, or notices posted at the industrial
user's premises or point of discharge.

1046.30 ELIMINATION OF DISCHARGE/REINSTATEMENT.
   Any industrial user notified of a rejection of its wastewater discharges
and/or a termination of its wastewater discharge permit and/or a disconnection
of wastewater treatment service, under Sections
1046.27 through
1046.29, shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a
failure of the industrial user, to comply voluntarily with the disconnection or
rejection order, the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division
shall take such steps as are deemed necessary, including immediate blockage or
severance of the sewer connection, and/or termination of potable water service
to the industrial user to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
danger to any person. If the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer
Division exercises its authority under Section
1046.29(a)(1), the Department of Public Works - Water and Sewer Division shall
reinstate the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit
upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge.

building, except that where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer.
   (c)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the City, to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
   (d)   The size, slope, alignment and materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the Building and Housing Code or other applicable rules and regulations of the
City. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the
materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the
American Society of Testing Materials Water Pollution Control Federation Manual
of Practice No. 9, and the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main
Construction in Illinois shall apply.
   (e)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by a means which is
approved by the City and discharged to the building sewer.
   (f)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the Building and Housing Code, other applicable
rules and regulations of the City or the procedures set forth in appropriate
specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials Water Pollution

1046.64 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   (a)   The City may institute a civil action for an injunction to restrain
violations of this chapter.
   (b)   The City may, upon discovering an ongoing or potential discharge of
pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appears to present an imminent danger
to the health or welfare of persons, seek and obtain from the Circuit Court of
Stephenson County a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to
halt or prohibit such discharge. Prior to the filing of such petition, the
discharger shall be given informal notice of the POTW intention to file such
action. Methods of informal notice shall include, but not be limited to, any of
the following: personal conversation between the discharger and City employees,
telephone calls, letters, hand-delivered messages or notices posted at the
discharger's premises or point of discharge. Personal contact between City
personnel and the discharger shall be attempted, but shall not be a condition
precedent to POTW petitioning for and obtaining a temporary restraining order.
   (c)   When the City finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
City may petition the Stephenson County branch of the Illinois Fifteenth
Judicial Circuit Court through an attorney retained by the City for this
purpose for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by
this chapter on activities of the user. The City may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.

1046.65 ADDITIONAL REMEDIES.
   (a)   In addition to remedies available to the City set forth elsewhere in
this chapter, if the POTW is fined by the State or the USEPA for a violation of
the NPDES permit or a violation of water quality standards as a result of the
discharge of pollutants, then the fine, including all the legal, sampling and
analytical testing costs and any other related costs, shall be charged to the
responsible industrial user. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu of, any other remedies the City may have under this chapter, statutes or
regulations, at law or in equity.
   (b)   If the discharge from any industrial user causes a deposit,
obstruction or damage to any of the POTW wastewater facilities, the City shall
cause the deposit or obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to
be promptly repaired. The cost for such work, including materials, labor and
supervision, shall be borne by the person or industrial user causing such
deposit, obstruction or damage.
   (c)   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The City
may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with Freeport's enforcement response plan. However, the City may take other
action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the City is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user.
   (d)   In addition to any fine levied under Section
1046.99, the City may, where the circumstances of the particular case so
dictate, seek injunctive relief to prohibit the user from discharging into the
sanitary sewer system, or to provide such other affirmative relief as may be
appropriate.

(1977 Code § 67-102)
1224.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS; INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICTS.
   (a)   Whenever any subdivision of land shall hereafter be laid out within
the incorporated limits of the City, or within contiguous territory not more
than one and one-half miles beyond the incorporated boundary of the City, the
subdivider thereof or his or her agent shall submit both a preliminary and a
final subdivision plat to the Planning Commission for its approval. The
subdivision plats and all procedures relating thereto shall in all respects be
in full compliance with this chapter.
   (b)   Until plats and plans for the subdivision are approved:
      (1)   No land shall be subdivided, nor any street laid out, nor any
improvements made to the natural land.
      (2)   No lot, tract or parcel of land within any subdivision shall be
offered for sale, nor shall any sale, contract for sale or option be made or
given.
      (3)   No improvements such as sidewalks, water supply, storm water
drainage, sanitary sewerage facilities, gas service, electrical service,
lighting and grading, paving or surfacing of a street shall hereafter be made
by any owner or owners or his, her or their agent, or by any public service
corporation at the request of such owner or owners or his, her or their agent.
      (4)   Lots subject to flooding and lots deemed by the Planning Commission
to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy nor for such
other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate a
flood hazard. Such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as
shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or as shall not
produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
   (c)   All offerings or dedications of land to the City for use as streets,
alleys, highways, schools, parks, playgrounds or other public use shall be
referred to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation before being
accepted by the City Council.
   (d)   Where a tract of land proposed by subdivision is part of a larger,
logical subdivision unit in relation to the City as a whole, the Planning
Commission may, before approval, cause to be prepared a plan for the entire
area or neighborhood, such plan to be used by the Planning Commission as an aid
in judging the proposed plat. The Public Works Director shall cooperate with
the Planning Commission in the preparation of this plan and shall furnish such
surveys and data as may be necessary.
   (e)   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements.
   (f)   No provision of this chapter shall be construed as being in conflict
with 765 ILCS 205/0.01 et seq. If any such conflict exists, the conflicting
provision of these Codified Ordinances shall be separable and void. All
pertinent and applicable provisions of 65 ILCS 5/11-12-4 et seq. and 5/11-15-
1 et seq., and of 765 ILCS 205/1 through 205/8, as heretofore or hereafter

1224.05 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL.
   (a)   Compliance Required; Fees. Any owner of land which is within the
corporate limits of the City, or within one and one-half miles of such
corporate limits, wishing to develop the same as a planned development or
wishing to divide the same into building lots for the purpose of sale or
assessment, or both, or wishing to dedicate streets, alleys or other lands for
public use, shall follow the procedures and requirements of this chapter. There
shall be a filing fee as provided for in Section
1224.16.
   (b)   Pre-Application Procedure. Prior to the filing of any application for
approval of a preliminary plan, the subdivider may submit to the office of the
Planning Commission plans and data as specified below. This step does not
require formal application, a fee, or filing or plans with the City Clerk. The
subdivider may request a meeting with the Planning Commission in order to
discuss his or her plans and particular problem.
   Pre-application information which may be submitted is as follows:
      (1)   General subdivision information shall describe or outline the
existing conditions of the site and the proposed development. This information
may include data on existing covenants, land characteristics and available
community facilities and utilities, and information describing the subdivision
proposal, such as the number of residential lots, the typical lot width and
depth, the price range, business areas, schools, playground and park areas, and
other public areas, proposed covenants, and proposed utilities and street
improvements.
      (2)   The sketch plan or topographic survey shall show in simple sketch
form the proposed layout of streets, lots and other features in relation to
existing conditions. The sketch plan may be a free hand pencil sketch made
directly on a print of the topographic survey. The sketch plan shall include
the existing topographic data and contours of not less than five-foot
intervals.
   (c)   Procedure for Approval of Preliminary Plat.
      (1)   The subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat,
together with improvement plans and other supplementary materials as specified
in Section
1224.08(a). Four copies of the preliminary plat and supplementary material
specified shall be submitted to the Community Development Director, on forms
provided by the Community Development Director, with written application for
approval. The preliminary plat shall be submitted to the Community Development
Director at least fifteen days prior to the regular meeting of the Planning
Commission to receive action thereon at that meeting.
      (2)   The City Clerk shall refer the preliminary plat to the Planning
Commission and shall, at the same time, instruct the Community Development
Director to collaborate with the subdivider and the Commission in assembling
plans for the design and construction of streets and such other public
improvements as are required by this chapter or any other ordinance. The
Commission shall, within sixty days from referral, submit its written
recommendations for approval or disapproval to the Council.
      (3)   If such plat is approved by the Commission, Council shall accept or
reject said plat within sixty days after its next regularly slated meeting
following the action of the Commission, and shall furnish to the subdivider, if
the plat is rejected, a written statement setting forth the reasons for
disapproval.
      (4)   The following qualifications shall govern approval of the
preliminary plat:
         A.   The approval of a preliminary plat by the Commission and Council
is tentative only, involving merely the general acceptability of the layout as
submitted.
         B.   The Commission and Council may require such changes or revisions
as are deemed necessary in the interests of the needs of the community.
         C.   If the Commission rejects the preliminary plat or if the
preliminary plat is not approved by the Community Development Committee it may
nevertheless be submitted to Council, but Council may approve said preliminary
plat only by the affirmative vote of six Aldermen.
         D.   Approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a maximum
period of one year, unless, upon application of the developer, Council grants
an extension. The application for said extension shall not require an
additional filing fee or the submittal of additional copies of the plat of the
subdivision.
   (d)   Procedure for Approval of Final Plat.
      (1)   The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat
as approved and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which he or she proposes to record and
develop at that time, provided, however, that such portion conforms to all
requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   Application for approval of the final plat shall be submitted in
writing to the Community Development Director as agent for the Planning
Commission at least fifteen days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered.
      (3)   Four copies of the final plat required for approval shall be
prepared as specified in Section
1224.08, and shall be submitted to the Commission within one year after
approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise such approval shall be null and
void, unless application for an extension of time is made to and granted by the
Commission. Such extension will not require an additional fee for filing of
additional copies of the plat.
      (4)   In all cases where private central sanitary sewer systems are to be
used, the developer shall secure the necessary permits for installation and
operation of the system from the State Sanitary Water Board and the City.
      (5)   Within sixty days after application for approval of the final plat,
the Commission shall approve or disapprove it. If the Commission approves, it
shall affix upon the plat the certifying signatures of its Chairperson and
Secretary. If it disapproves, it shall set forth its reasons in its own records
and provide the applicant with a new copy.
      (6)   The approved final plat shall be submitted to Council for approval
and for acceptance of all streets, alleys, ways, easements, parks or other
areas preserved for, or dedicated to, the public, by resolution. If the
Commission rejects the final plat or if the final plat is not approved by the
Community Development Committee it may nevertheless be submitted to Council,
but Council may approve said plat, and accept the public areas and easements
thereon, only by the affirmative vote of six Aldermen.
         A.   If the final plat is approved, the City Clerk shall attach a
certified copy of the resolution of approval to a copy of the plat. If the plat
is disapproved, the resolution shall state the reasons for the disapproval,
specifying with particularity the aspects in which the plat fails to conform.
The resolution shall be filed in the office of the City Clerk.
         B.   If the plat is approved by the Commission, Council shall accept
or reject the final plat within thirty days after its next regularly slated
meeting following the action of the Commission.
         C.   If Council fails to act upon the final plat within the time
prescribed, the subdivider may, after giving five days written notice to the
City Clerk, file a complaint for summary judgment in the Circuit Court.
      (7)   Upon approval by Council, the subdivider shall record the plat with
the County Recorder within three months. If not recorded within this time, the
approval shall be null and void. Immediately after recording, the original
tracing or a duly certified reproducible copy, on cloth or other suitable
material, shall be filed with the City.
   (e)   Notice. Owners and subdividers of the land to be platted, when filing
a preliminary plat, when filing any supplemental or subsequent documents, and
when filing a final plat, shall also file with the Community Development
Director a written list containing the names and mailing addresses of all
owners of property adjacent to, contiguous to or across any street, river,
creek or public way from any part of the land to be platted. The applicant,
within five days of the date of the filing of the preliminary plat or final
plat, as the case may be, shall give written notice by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, to all of the owners identified on said list.
The Community Development Director, within five days of the filing of the
preliminary plat or final plat, as the case may be, shall publish a notice one
time in a newspaper of general daily circulation in the County. The owners and
subdividers of the land to be platted shall pay the cost of mailing notices and

shall give the date of the preliminary plat or final plat, as the case may be,
describe the documents filed, state that they can be examined during business
hours in the office of the Community Development Director and give the date and
place on which the hearing will be held regarding said preliminary plat or

the Commission on preliminary plats, final plats and supplemental or subsequent
documents shall be held not less than fifteen days nor more than sixty days
from the date of the filing with the Community Development Director of the
preliminary plat, final plat or supplemental or subsequent documents, as the
case may be.
   (f)   Notice to City Council. Within one business day of the filing of the
petition, the Community Development Director shall give notice to the members
of the City Council. This notice shall describe the real estate referred to in

easements, sites for parks, playgrounds and schools, or other land to be
dedicated for public use, shall conform to the Official Comprehensive Plan and
Official Zoning Map, as adopted in
Chapter 1222 of these Codified Ordinances.
   (a)   Streets.
      (1)   All streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety,
and to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
      (2)   Where such is not shown on the Official Zoning Map, the arrangement
of streets in a subdivision shall either:
         A.   Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of
existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or
         B.   Conform to a plat for the area or neighborhood approved or
adopted by the Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where
topographical or other conditions make continuance of or conformance to
existing streets impracticable.
      (3)   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged.
      (4)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
highway or primary thoroughfare, as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the
Planning Commission may require marginal access streets; reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a non-access reservation, at least ten feet wide,
along the rear property line; deep lots with rear service alleys; or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (5)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad or highway,
the Planning Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on
each side of such railroad or highway, at a distance suitable for the
appropriate use of the intervening land, for park purposes in residential
districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts.
Such distances shall also be determined with the regard for the requirements of
approach grades and future grade separations:
      (6)   Reserve strips controlling access to public utilities, alleys or
streets shall be prohibited.
      (7)   All street intersections and confluences shall encourage safe
traffic flow.
      (8)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
avoided.
      (9)   Tangents shall be introduced between reverse curves on all streets
(see Table of Minimum Standards).
      (10)   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at one point
by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure clear sight distances (see Table of Minimum Standards).
      (11)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible
at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than
sixty degrees.
      (12)   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a
radius as specified in the Table of Minimum Standards. The Planning Commission
may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in place of rounded lines.
      (13)   Street right-of-way widths shall be specified in the Table of
Minimum Standards.
      (14)   Half-streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of this chapter and where the Planning Commission finds it will be
practicable to require the destination of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half-street is adjacent to a tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract.
      (15)   Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs), designed to be so permanently,
shall not be longer than 500 feet from the intersection of the origin through
the center of the circle to the end of the right of way, and shall be provided
at the closed end with a paved turn-around having an outside pavement diameter
of at least 100 feet and a street property line diameter of at least 120 feet.
      (16)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets. Existing street names shall be projected
wherever possible. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the
Planning Commission.
      (17)   Street gradients and vertical curves shall be as specified in the
Table of Minimum Standards.
      (18)   Street grades shall provide proper relation between the street and
the first floor elevation of the houses or buildings to permit convenient and
economical access to and drainage of the lots.

   (b)   Alleys.
      (1)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial, business and industrial

other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-
street loading, unloading and parking, consistent with and adequate for the
uses proposed.
      (2)   Alleys in residential areas shall not be permitted, except where

feet in residential areas and thirty feet in commercial, business and
industrial districts.
      (4)   Alley intersections and sharp changes in alley alignment shall be
avoided, but, where necessary, corners may be cut off sufficiently to permit
safe vehicular movement.
      (5)   Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if
unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate facilities at the dead-end,

right of way conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse, which
shall include such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate
for the purpose, as determined by the Planning Commission. Parallel streets or
parkways may be required in connection therewith.
   (d)   Blocks.
      (1)   The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to:
         A.   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special
needs of the type of use contemplated;
         B.   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions within the
corporate limits of the City of Freeport and the one and one-half mile area
over which the City has jurisdiction;
         C.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic;
         D.   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
      (2)   Block lengths shall not exceed 1,500 feet or be less than 600 feet.

water supply, shall be not less than 100 feet wide at the building line nor
less than 20,000 square feet in area. Where either community sanitary sewers
and sewage treatment or water supply is provided, a lot shall be not less than
eighty feet wide nor less than 15,000 square feet in area.
         B.   Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream shall
have a minimum width or depth as required to provide an adequate building site
and to afford the minimum usable area required herein or required by the
applicable City or County zoning ordinance for front, rear and side yards.

      (3)   On all corner lots there shall be maintained not less than the
minimum building setback line on both streets.
      (4)   All lots shall abut on a publicly dedicated street.
      (5)   Double-frontage and reverse-frontage lots shall be avoided except
where essential to provide separation of residential development from highways
or primary thoroughfares or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography
and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten feet, and across
which there shall be no right of vehicular access, shall be provided along the
rear lot lines of lots abutting such highways and primary thoroughfares.
      (6)   Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to
street lines.
      (7)   All remnants of lots below minimum size, left over after
subdividing of a larger tract, shall be added to adjacent lots and not allowed
to remain as unusable parcels.
   (f)   Building Setback Lines. Building setback lines in residential areas of
new subdivisions shall conform to the front yard provisions of the applicable
City or County zoning ordinance, except that in no case shall the building

public use shown in the Official Comprehensive Plan and Official Zoning Map, as
adopted in
Chapter 1222 , is located in whole or in part within a subdivision, the
subdivider shall reserve, or may dedicate, adequate space for such purpose when
the Planning Commission finds the requirements to be reasonably necessary to
the public health and welfare.
      (1)   The dedication of public spaces, as provided above, shall not
constitute an acceptance of the dedication by the City.
      (2)   Whenever a school site, park site or other public land is reserved
in a final plat, the corporate authorities having jurisdiction of such use, be
it the City, School Board, Park Board or other authority, shall acquire the
land so reserved by purchase, or shall commence condemnation proceedings to
acquire such land, within one year from the date of final approval of such plat
by the City Council. In the event such corporate authority does not take such
action within such period, the land so reserved may thereafter be used by the
owners thereof in any such manner consistent with the provisions of the
Official Zoning Map, the Official Zoning Map ordinance and these Codified
Ordinances.

Ord. 2020-12. Passed 3-2-20.)
1224.12 REQUIRED LAND IMPROVEMENTS.
   No subdivision of land shall be approved unless the subdivider has first
received a statement signed by the City Engineer, certifying that the

bituminous concrete surface course, Subclass B-5. If, during construction, the
sub-soil base does not appear to be suitable for the design requirements above,
based on inspection by the City Engineer or his or her representative, the
developer may be required to conduct soil borings every 200 linear feet along
the proposed street alignment to determine what additional work may be required
to create a suitable sub-base. Such work may involve, but not be limited to,
lime stabilization or undercutting and removing sub-standard soils and
replacement with an approved aggregate sub-base.
      (2)   Improvements in expressways and primary and secondary streets shall
meet the current design standards, as to thickness, width and type of

with other underground services. Further, all transformer boxes shall be
located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public.
   (d)   Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks shall be constructed to a width of not
less than five feet and a minimum thickness of four inches over an approved
aggregate base course of two inches. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides
of all streets and thoroughfares, except in subdivisions with lots of not less

half inches shall be planted along all streets where trees do not exist, and
placed in such a manner as to provide an effective appearance for the
enhancement of abutting properties.
      (3)   All trees to be planted shall be of a species and variety approved
by the Forestry Commission.
   (f)   Street Lighting and Marking. Provisions and installation shall be made
for adequate lighting and name markers of public streets within the proposed
subdivision in accordance with the standards and requirements established by
the governing authorities. The installation and maintenance of street lighting
shall be conducted according to the following procedures:
      (1)   The subdivider shall be responsible for purchasing and installing
all street lighting according to the specifications established by the office
of the Public Works Director and the layout plan drafted by the City's
electrical franchisee for the geographical area of the subdivision.
      (2)   After the lighting is installed, the subdivider shall dedicate such
lighting system to the City, and the City Council shall vote to approve the
final plat and to accept such dedication only if lighting meets each of the
requirements previously established by the office of the Public Works Director
or if the City Council votes to accept such dedication even with technical
defects therein.
      (3)   After the City's acceptance of such dedication, the City shall own
said lighting system and shall be responsible for maintaining the same,
including, but not limited to, changing light bulbs and paying the City's
electrical franchisee for any and all electricity provided to said lighting
system.
      (4)   The Public Works Director is hereby authorized to issue such
regulations concerning the specifications of said lighting system as are, in
his or her opinion, needed to provide an adequate supply of street lighting for
safety purposes or for other needs of the public, provided that such

1240.01 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this Zoning Code are:
   (a)   To promote and protect the public health, safety, morals, comfort and
general welfare of the people;
   (b)   To divide the City of Freeport into zones or districts restricting and
regulating therein the location, erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration and use of buildings, structures and land for residence, business,
manufacturing and other specified uses;
   (c)   To protect the character and the stability of the residential,
business and manufacturing areas within the City of Freeport and to promote the
orderly and beneficial development of such areas;
   (d)   To provide adequate light, air, privacy and convenience of access to
property;
   (e)   To regulate the intensity of use of lot areas, and to determine the
area of open spaces surrounding buildings, necessary to provide adequate light
and air, and to protect the public health;
   (f)   To establish building lines and the location of buildings designed for
residential, business, manufacturing or other uses within such areas;
   (g)   To fix reasonable standards to which buildings or structures shall
conform therein;
   (h)   To prohibit uses, buildings or structures incompatible with the
character of development or intended uses within specified zoning districts;
   (i)   To prevent additions to, or alteration or remodeling of, existing
buildings or structures in such a way as to avoid the restrictions and
limitations imposed hereunder;

regulating the use and bulk of buildings in relation to the land surrounding
them;
   (m)   To conserve the taxable value of land and buildings throughout the
City of Freeport;
   (n)   To provide for the elimination of non-conforming uses of land,

and bodies as provided herein.
(1977 Code § 73-101)
1240.02 INTERPRETATION; CONFLICTS.
   (a)   Minimum Requirements. The provisions of this Zoning Code shall be held
to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety,
morals and welfare.
   (b)   Relationship With Other Laws. Where the conditions imposed by any
provision herein upon the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of
buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable
conditions imposed by any other provision herein or any other law, ordinance,
resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more
restrictive (or which impose higher standards or requirements) shall govern.
   (c)   Conflicts With Illinois Municipal Code. No provision of this Zoning
Code shall be construed as being in conflict with 65 ILCS 5/11-13-1 et seq. or
65 ILCS 5/11-14-1 et seq. If any such conflict exists, the conflicting
provision of this Zoning Code shall be separable and void. All pertinent and
applicable provisions of 65 ILCS 5/11-13-1 et seq. or 65 ILCS 5/11-14-1 et
seq., as heretofore and hereafter amended, are incorporated herein by
reference.
   (d)   Effect of Existing Agreements. This Zoning Code is not intended to
abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement, provided that
where the regulations of this Zoning Code are more restrictive (or impose
higher standards or requirements) than such easements, covenants or other
private agreements, the requirements herein shall govern.
(1977 Code §§ 73-201, 73-1503)
1240.03 APPLICATION OF CODE.
   (a)   Change in Structures or Use. Except as may otherwise be provided, all
buildings erected hereafter, all uses of land or buildings established
hereafter, all structural alterations or relocation of existing buildings
occurring hereafter, and all enlargements of or additions to existing uses
occurring hereafter, shall be subject to all regulations herein which are
applicable to the zoning districts in which such buildings, uses or land shall
be located.
   (b)   Non-Conforming Buildings, Structures and Uses. Any lawful building,
structure or use existing at the time of the enactment of this Zoning Code may
be continued, even though such building, structure or use does not conform to
the provisions herein for the district in which it is located, and whenever a
district shall be changed hereafter, the then existing lawful use may be
continued, subject to the provisions of
Chapter 1266.
   (c)   Building Permits. Where a building permit for a building or structure
has been issued in accordance with law prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Code, and provided that construction is begun within ninety days of such
effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion, said building or
structure may be completed in accordance with the approved plans on the basis
of which the building permit was issued, and further may, upon completion, be

(1977 Code §73-1202; Ord. 94-81. Passed 9-19-94; Ord. 97-61. Passed 11-3-97;
Ord. 2018-46. Passed 9-4-18.)
1242.05 FILING OF DOCUMENTS.

order, action, requirement, decision, certificate or determination of either

(1977 Code § 73-1204; Ord. 94-81. Passed 9-19-94.)
1242.06 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Authority. The City Council, after receiving a report from the Zoning

regulations of this Zoning Code if it finds that the variance requested is in
harmony with the general purpose and intent and complies with all the standards
for variances established herein.
   (b)   Standards for Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not
recommend nor shall the City Council grant, any variance from the regulations
of this Zoning Code unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence
presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this Zoning Code;
      (2)   Strict enforcement of this Zoning Code would result in practical
difficulties or impose exceptional hardships due to special and unusual
conditions which are not generally found on other properties in the same zoning
district;
      (3)   The property cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be
used only under the conditions allowed by this Zoning Code;
      (4)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and

the neighborhood and will not be a substantial detriment to adjacent property.
(1977 Code §73-1302; Ord. 2010-53. Passed 12-20-10; Ord. 2018-46. Passed 9-4-
18.)
1242.07 SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   (a)   Authority. The development and execution of this Zoning Code is based
on the division of the City into zoning districts within which districts the
use of buildings, structures and land, and the bulk and location of buildings
and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is
recognized, however, that there are certain uses which, because of their unique
characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or
districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses
upon adjacent land and of the public need for the particular use in the
particular location. The City Council, after receiving a report from the Zoning
Board of Appeals containing its findings and recommendations, may grant a
special use permit as to certain specified uses designated as special uses
within a particular zoning district or districts.
   (b)   Standards for Granting Special Use Permits. The Zoning Board of
Appeals shall not recommend nor the City Council grant a special use permit in
a particular zoning district or districts unless it shall make findings based
upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will
not be detrimental to, or endanger the public health, safety and general
welfare;
      (2)   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate area for the purpose already permitted, nor
substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood; and
      (3)   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the adjacent property for uses permitted
in the district.
   (c)   Conditions and Guarantees. Prior to the granting of any special use,
the Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend, and the City Council shall
stipulate, such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance and operation of the special use as are deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance
with the standards and requirements specified herein. In all cases in which a
special use is granted, the City Council shall require such evidence and
guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions stipulated in
connection therewith are being, and will be, complied with.
(1977 Code §73-1303; Ord. 86-7. Passed 2-3-86; Ord. 2010-53. Passed 12-20-10;
Ord. 2018-46. Passed 9-4-18.)
1242.08 EFFECT OF DENIAL OF VARIATION, SPECIAL PERMIT, SPECIAL USE OR ZONING
AMENDMENT.
   No application for a variation, special use or map amendment which has been
denied wholly or in part by the City Council shall be resubmitted for a period
of one calendar year from the date of the City Council action denying the
application, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of substantially
changed conditions found to be a valid ground for waiver of said one-year
limitation by the City Council.
(1977 Code §73-1305-A; Ord. 86-7. Passed 2-3-86; Ord. 2018-46. Passed 9-4-18.)
1242.09 INTERPRETATION OF VARIANCES, SPECIAL USE PERMITS, ETC.
   The construction, use, occupancy and enjoyment of the variation, special use
permit or other authority granted upon application shall be, at all times after
issuance, in strict accordance with, and limited by, the written proposals,
description of use, and building plans, sketches and maps, forming a part of,
and retained with, the application, and all restrictions issued with the grant.
   Except as specifically stated to the contrary in a special zoning ordinance
enacted under this Zoning Code, the granting of any amendment, variance or
special use permit under this Zoning Code shall not entitle any person to
disregard any other applicable provision of these Codified Ordinances, as now
or hereafter amended, including, but not limited to, the provisions of this
Planning and Zoning Code, the Building and Housing Code and the Fire Prevention
Code.
(1977 Code §73-1307; Ord. 90-83. Passed 11-5-90; Ord. 2010-53. Passed 12-20-10;
Ord. 2018-46. Passed 9-4-18.)
1242.10 EXPIRATION OF AUTHORIZATION.
   (a)   If work, construction or use has not begun within six months after the
granting of a variation, special use permit or other authority, such
authorization shall expire and terminate by limitation automatically. The
Community Development Director shall notify in writing the applicant or
subsequent owner of the parcel benefiting from the variation, special use
permit or other authority of the invalidity of the variation, special use
permit or other authority because of the lapse in initiation of the allowed
use. The Community Development Director shall forward a copy of all such
invalidity notifications to each member of the City Council within ten business
days of their mailing to the owner or owners.
   (b)   If work, construction or use has not begun within six months after the
effective date of a zoning classification amendment ordinance, then the office
of the Community Development Director shall report that fact in writing to each
member of the City Council. The office of the Community Development Director
shall monitor the progress of all such work and uses of rezoned parcels for the
purpose of effectuating the intent of this section. Upon delivery of such
report to the City Council, the Community Development Director shall notify the
applicant or the subsequent owners of the rezoned parcel to appear before City
Council for the purpose of detailing the proposed schedule for the rezoned use
of the parcel. If no satisfactory application is provided, the City Council may
elect to enact an ordinance returning the parcel to the prior zoning
classification.
   (c)   In his or her written annual report, the Community Development
Director shall include a list of all parcels complying with or violating this
section.

2013-01. Passed 1-7-13.)
1246.02 ZONING MAP.
   (a)   The boundaries of the zoning districts are established as shown on the
map entitled "Official Zoning Map of Freeport, Illinois," which Zoning Map
accompanies and is made a part of this Zoning Code, and such Zoning Map shall
have the same force and effect as if the same, together with all notations,
references and other information shown thereon, were fully set forth and
described herein.
   (b)   The premises at 218-224 North Cherry Avenue, and at 221 North Cherry
Avenue, are zoned in the B-3 District, instead of the R-7 District, as shown on
the Zoning Map.
(1977 Code § 73-402)
1246.03 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   When uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   District boundary lines are either the centerlines of railroads,
highways, streets, alleys or easements, or the boundary lines of sections,
tracts or lots, or such lines extended, unless otherwise indicated.
   (b)   In areas not subdivided into lots and blocks, wherever a district is
indicated as a strip adjacent to and paralleling a street or highway, the depth
of such strips shall be in accordance with the dimensions shown on the maps
measured at right angles from the centerline of the street or highway, and the
length of frontage shall be in accordance with dimensions shown on the map from
section, quarter-section or division lines, or centerlines of streets, highways
or railroad rights of way, unless otherwise indicated.
   (c)   Where a lot held in one ownership, and of record on the effective date
of this Zoning Code, is divided by a district boundary line, the entire lot
shall be construed to be within the less restricted district, provided that
this construction shall not apply if it increases the less restricted frontage
of the lot by more than twenty-five feet.
(1977 Code § 73-403)
1246.04 ZONING OF PUBLIC WAYS.
   All streets, alleys, other public ways, waterways and railroad rights of
way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the
same zone as the property immediately abutting on such alleys, streets, other
public ways, waterways and railroad rights of way. Where the centerline of a
street, alley, other public way, waterway or railroad right of way serves as a
district boundary, the zoning of such area, unless otherwise specifically
designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up
to such centerline.
(1977 Code § 73-404)
1246.05 ZONING OF ANNEXED LAND.
   Ordinances annexing territory to the City of Freeport shall assign a zoning
classification to the annexed territory. The classification assigned shall be
R-3 One-Family Residence District, unless, within the City boundaries, there
are one or more parcels of real estate which are contiguous to, adjacent to, or
across any street, alley, river, creek or public way from, any part of the
territory annexed, one or more of which have a more restrictive zoning
classification than R-3, in which event the annexed territory shall be assigned
the most restrictive of the zoning classifications assigned to such other
parcels. The classification assigned shall be an R-1 One-Family Residence
District, in the event any of the other parcels has such a classification, or
if none has an R-1 classification but one or more have an R-2 One-Family
Residence District classification, then the annexed territory shall be assigned
an R-2 classification. A copy of each proposed annexation ordinance shall be
sent to the Planning Commission to conduct a public hearing thereon before its
passage by the City Council. If the Planning Commission determines that the
zoning classification assigned to the annexed territory (which, under the
foregoing provisions of this section, will be either R-1, R-2 or R-3) is not a
proper classification, it shall send to the City Council a plan of zoning for
the annexed territory. Upon approval of such plan, the City Council shall amend
the proposed annexation ordinance to reflect the zoning classification or
classifications recommended by the Planning Commission.

1260.01 PURPOSE.
   The F-1 Flood Plain District is established and delineated on the Zoning Map
to meet the needs of the Pecatonica River and its tributaries to carry the
abnormal flow of water at times of flood; to insure that the taxable value of
land and buildings throughout the City may be conserved; to prevent
encroachments into the District which will unduly increase flood height and
damage; and to prevent the loss of life and excessive damage to property in the
area of greatest flood hazard.
(1977 Code § 73-501)
1260.02 PERMITTED USES.
   The following uses are permitted:
   (a)   Open-type uses, such as loading and unloading areas, parking lots,
storage of motor vehicles (new and used) for not more than twenty-four hour
periods, and gardens, auxiliary to uses permitted in an adjoining district.
   (b)   Storage yards for equipment and materials in movable containers and
not subject to major damage by flood, provided such uses are permitted in an
adjoining district, but not including acids, caustics, flammable liquids,
trash, rags, bottles, scrap metal or any other materials commonly referred to

restrict bridge openings and other restricted sections of the stream.
   (d)   Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, topographic data,
engineering studies and other studies are needed to determine the effect of the
structure on the flow of water, the Planning Commission may require the
applicant to submit such data or studies prepared by competent engineers or
other technicians.
   (e)   All uses permitted shall be subject to the approval of the Planning
Commission and to such conditions as may be stipulated to protect the public
interest.

1262.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to alleviate or prevent the congestion of the
public streets, and so promote the safety and welfare of the public, by
establishing minimum requirements for the off-street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is
put.
(1977 Code § 73-1001)
1262.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Scope of Chapter. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this Zoning Code shall apply as follows:
      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and for all uses of land
established after the effective date of this Zoning Code, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
district in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code, and
provided that construction is begun within one year of such effective date and
diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities as required
hereinafter need not be provided.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other unit of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
         However, no building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code shall be required
to provide such additional parking or loading facilities, unless and until the
aggregate increase in units of measurement shall equal not less than fifteen
percent of the unit of measurement existing upon the effective date of this
Zoning Code, in which event parking or loading facilities as required herein
shall be provided for the total increase.
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use. However, if the said building or
structure was erected prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code,
additional parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by
which the requirements for the new use would exceed those for the existing use
if the latter were subject to the parking and loading provisions of this Zoning
Code.
   (b)   Existing Facilities. Accessory off-street parking or loading
facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use served, and
which were in existence on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or were
provided voluntarily after such effective date, shall not hereafter be reduced
below the requirements of this Zoning Code for a similar new building or use,
or if already less than such requirements, shall not further be reduced below
them.
   (c)   Establishment of Facilities. Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be
deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading
facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided that all
regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and operation of
such facilities are adhered to.
   (d)   Damage or Destruction of Existing Building or Use. For any conforming
or legally non-conforming building or use which is in existence on the
effective date of this Zoning Code, which subsequently thereto is damaged or
destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause, and which is
reconstructed, re-established or repaired, off-street parking or loading
facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or
destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this Zoning Code for equivalent new uses or
construction.
   (e)   Control of Off-Site Parking Facilities. When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are accessory. No such off-site parking
facilities shall be authorized, and no occupancy permit shall be issued, where
the plans call for parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot, until
and unless the Board of Zoning Appeals has reviewed the plans, heard the
applicant and made findings that the common ownership or possession of the
zoning lot and the site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to
continue and that the off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all
times during the life of the proposed use or building.
   (f)   Submission of Plot Plan. Any application for a building permit, or
certificate of occupancy shall include therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale
and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided
in compliance with this Zoning Code and any driveways connecting such
facilities to a public street.
   (g)   Area Exempt From Regulations. The provisions of Sections
1262.05 and
1262.06 shall not be applicable to zoning lots within the following area of the
City of Freeport: Commencing at the intersection of the centerlines of East
Jackson Street and South Walnut, and running thence east along the centerline
of East Jackson Street to the intersection of the centerline of South Liberty
Avenue, thence northwesterly along the centerline of Liberty Avenue to its
intersection with the west R.O.W. line of the I.C.R.R. tracks, thence
northwesterly along the west R.O.W. line of the I.C.R.R. tracks to its
intersection with the centerline of East Clark Street extended, thence
southwesterly along the centerline of East Clark Street to its intersection
with the centerline of North Chicago Avenue, thence northwesterly along the
centerline of North Chicago Avenue to its intersection with the centerline of
West Linden Street, thence southwesterly along the centerline of West Linden
Street to its intersection with the centerline of West Galena Avenue, thence
westerly along the centerline of West Galena Avenue to its intersection with
the centerline of North Walnut Avenue, thence southeasterly along the
centerline of North Walnut Avenue to its intersection with the centerline of
West Douglas Street, thence southwesterly along the centerline of West Douglas
Avenue to its intersection with the centerline of North Cherry Avenue, thence
southeasterly along the centerline of North Cherry Avenue to its intersection
with the centerline of West Spring Street, thence northeasterly along the
centerline of West Spring Street to its intersection with the centerline of
South Walnut Avenue, thence southeasterly along the centerline of South Walnut
Avenue to the place of commencement.
(1977 Code § 73-1002; Ord. 2024-38. Passed 8-19-24.)
1262.03 USE OF PARKING FACILITIES; NUMBER, SIZE, ETC.; DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Use of Parking Facilities. Off-street parking facilities accessory to
residential use and developed in any residential district, in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter, shall be used solely for the parking of
passenger automobiles, three-quarter ton trucks or less and one-ton passenger
vans or less, owned by occupants of the dwelling structures to which such
facilities are accessory or by guests of said occupants. Under no circumstances
shall required parking facilities accessory to residential structures be used
for the parking of automobiles belonging to the employees, owners, tenants,
visitors or customers of business or manufacturing establishments.
   (b)   Joint Parking Facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different
buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be provided collectively
in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each
constituent use would be permitted, provided that the total number of spaces so
located together shall no be less than the sum of the separate requirements for
each use and provided that the owners of the properties utilizing the joint
parking facilities file a copy of the joint parking agreement with the
Community Development Department. If any of the properties are located in a
platted subdivision, a copy of the joint parking agreement shall be recorded
with the plat in the office of the Stephenson County Clerk and Recorder.
   (c)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces is required by this Zoning Code results in the requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a
fraction in excess of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
   (d)   Size. A required off-street parking space shall be at least nine feet
in width and at least nineteen feet in length, exclusive of access drives or
aisles, ramps, columns or office or work areas. Such space shall have a
vertical clearance of at least seven feet. The minimum dimensions for parking
stalls shall be in compliance with this section and Table D-1 (Off-Street
Parking Stall Dimensions).

90 degrees 9'          19'          19'         7'
 
   (e)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly
upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street
parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access
to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic
movements. Any required off-street parking space shall be connected to a public
street by means of a driveway and driveway approach which complies with the
provisions of
Chapter 1027 hereof. The minimum dimensions for parking aisles shall be in
compliance with this section and Table E-1 (Off-Street Aisle Parking
Dimensions).

90 degrees 24'           24'
 
   (f)   Facilities in Yards. Off-street parking spaces may not be located in
any required front yard. Off-street parking spaces may be located in required
side or rear yards only with the written approval of the Community Development
Director upon satisfactory proof that the proposed location will not encroach
onto neighboring property. Provided, that in no event shall any required off-
street parking space or driveway surface be located closer than two feet to any
existing lot line. For purposes of this Section, location of the physical lot
corner pins, or the provision of a professional survey shall constitute
"satisfactory proof" of the location of the lot line.
   (g)   Parking or Storage in Parkways. No person, firm or corporation shall
park, deposit, leave or store any motor vehicle, tangible personal property or
vehicle of any type or description at any time between the sidewalk line and
curb line at any place within the City.

      (1)   Open and enclosed parking spaces. Accessory parking spaces located
on the same lot occupied by the use served may be open to the sky, covered by a
carport or solar canopy, or enclosed in a building. Accessory parking spaces
located in a residence district elsewhere than on the same lot occupied by the
use served shall be open to the sky, except when otherwise allowed as a special
use.
      (2)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas and driveways shall be
improved with a compacted macadam base, not less than seven (7) inches thick,
surfaced with not less than three (3) inches of asphaltic concrete or some
comparable all-weather dustless material. Sand and gravel are not considered
all-weather dustless materials.
      (3)   Bumper stops, wheel stops and curbing. Bumper stops, wheel stops or
curbing shall be provided to prevent vehicles from damaging or encroaching upon
any sidewalk, landscaped area or parking lot island, fence, wall or building.
      (4)   Striping. Parking spaces shall be delineated with paint or other
permanent materials, which shall be maintained in clearly visible condition.
      (5)   Screening and landscaping. All open automobile parking areas
containing more than four parking spaces shall be effectively screened on each
side adjoining or fronting on any property situated in a residence district, or
any institutional premises, by a wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge
not less than five feet nor more than seven feet in height. Such required
screening shall conform to the front and side yard setback requirements of the
district in which the parking is located and with Chapter
1272 (Landscaping and Screening) of these Codified Ordinances.
      (6)   Lighting. Lighting of off-street parking areas is required. Any
lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be directed away
from residential properties in such a way as not to create a nuisance. A
lighting plan shall be required any time exterior lighting is proposed or
modified and shall be submitted along with the site plan information to the
City Engineer for approval. The lighting plan shall include a site plan
indicating: the location, height, type, design, orientation, anchorage, and
wattage of all proposed light fixtures; a photometric plan prepared by a
lighting professional showing spot illumination levels at regularly spaced
intervals on the lot and at all lot lines and average proposed illumination
levels on the site; a summary table containing average foot-candles, minimum
foot-candles, maximum foot-candles, uniformity ratio (average/minimum), and
catalog cuts of the proposed fixtures.
      (7)   Signs. Accessory signs are permitted on parking areas.
      (8)   Accessibility. Off-street parking facilities shall be constructed
and maintained in full compliance with the Illinois Accessibility Code, April

formulated and published by authorization of the State of Illinois Capital
Development Board.
      (9)   Maintenance. Off-street parking facilities shall be maintained in a
safe operating condition so as not to create a hazard or nuisance. All
materials used in the design of paving, lighting fixtures, retaining walls,
fences, curbs and benches, and other features must be continuously maintained
and kept free of debris or hazards, including but not limited to potholes,
broken curbing and other irregularities.
      (10)   Repair and service. No motor vehicle repair work of any kind shall
be permitted in conjunction with accessory off-street parking facilities
provided in a residence district.

off-street parking facilities is not permitted in any residence district.
   (i)   Storm Water Management. All off-street parking facilities shall comply
with Chapter
1050 (Storm Sewers) of these Codified Ordinances.
   (j)   Floor Area Exemptions. When two or more uses are located on the same
zoning lot, only one exemption for floor area, as set forth in Section
1262.05, shall be taken.

1264.01 STANDARDS.
   Planned developments are of such substantially different character from
other special use variations that specific and additional standards and
exceptions are hereby established to govern the recommendations of the Planning
Commission and the action of the City Council.
   (a)   Use Regulations. In the case of residential, business or manufacturing
planned developments, the Planning Commission may recommend, and the City
Council may authorize, that there be in part of the area of such a development
and for the duration of such development, specified uses not permitted by the
use regulations for the district in which said development is located, provided
that the Planning Commission shall find:
      (1)   That the uses permitted by such variation are necessary or
desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the
development;
      (2)   That the uses permitted by such special use variation are not of
such a nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the
surrounding neighborhood;
      (3)   That not more than twenty percent of the ground area or of the
gross floor area of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by
said special use variation;
      (4)   That in a manufacturing planned development such additional uses
allowed by use variations shall conform to the performance standards of the
district in which the development is located, as set forth herein;
      (5)   That the special use variation so allowed is reflected by the
appropriate zoning district symbols and so recorded on the Zoning Map.
   (b)   Bulk Regulations. In the case of a planned development, the Planning
Commission may recommend, and the City Council may authorize, variations from
the applicable bulk regulations of this Zoning Code within the boundaries of
such development, provided that the Planning Commission shall find:
      (1)   That such variation shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents of or occupants of
such development, as well as of neighboring properties, than would be obtained
under the bulk regulations of this Zoning Code for buildings developed on
separate zoning lots;
      (2)   That the overall minimum lot area or maximum lot coverage of a
residential planned development would not exceed by more than fifteen percent
the requirements for individual uses in the district in which such planned
development is located;
      (3)   That the minimum lot area per dwelling unit requirements herein
shall not be decreased by more than fifteen percent in any such development
containing residential uses, and that there shall be available to each
residential building, and immediately adjacent thereto (including the land area
upon which it is erected), the minimum amount of land area required for such
building under the lot area per dwelling unit provisions of this Zoning Code;
      (4)   That spacing between principal buildings shall be at least
equivalent to such spacing as would be required between buildings similarly
developed under the terms of this Zoning Code on separate zoning lots, due
consideration being given to the openness normally afforded by intervening
alleys and streets;
      (5)   That along the periphery of such planned developments, yards shall
be provided as required by the regulations of the district in which said
development is located.
   (c)   Planned Business Developments. In a planned business development the
following additional requirements are hereby specified:
      (1)   All buildings shall be set back not less than thirty feet from all
streets bounding the site.
      (2)   Required off-street parking space shall be provided at a ratio of
not less than three square feet of parking space for each square foot of gross
floor area.
      (3)   All streets, parking areas and walks within the planned development
shall be paved with a hard-surfaced material meeting the specifications of the
Public Works Director.
      (4)   Any part of the planned development not used for buildings or other
structures, loading and access ways shall be landscaped with grass, trees,
shrubs or pedestrian walkways.
      (5)   The buildings in the planned development shall be designed and
built as a whole, unified and single project.

1266.01 CONTINUANCE.
   (a)   Uses. Any lawfully established use of a building or land on the
effective date of this Zoning Code, that does not conform to the use
regulations for the district in which it is located, shall be deemed to be a
legal non-conforming use and may be continued, except as otherwise provided
herein.
   (b)   Structures. Any otherwise legal, non-conforming structure may be
continued in use, provided there is no physical change other than necessary
maintenance and repair, except as otherwise permitted herein. Any building for
which a permit has been lawfully granted prior to the effective date of this
Zoning Code may be completed in accordance with the approved plans, provided
construction is started within ninety days and diligently prosecuted to
completion. Such building shall thereafter be deemed a lawfully existing
building.
   (c)   Signs. Non-conforming signs which are in place and in safe condition
on January 1, 1975, may be continued, except as otherwise provided herein. All
non-conforming signs shall be inspected periodically by or at the direction of
the Zoning Administrator. The owner of each such sign shall pay the City for
the cost of no more than one inspection per year. Non-conforming signs shall
not be altered or modified to advertise a different business, product or
service after the effective date of this amendment.
(1977 Code § 73-301)
1266.02 DISCONTINUANCE OF USE.
   (a)   Whenever any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a non-
conforming use is changed to or replaced by a use conforming to the provisions
of this Zoning Code, such premises shall not thereafter be used or occupied by
a non-conforming use, even though the building may have been originally
designed and constructed for the prior non-conforming use.
   (b)   Whenever a non-conforming use of a building or structure or part
thereof, has been discontinued for a period of twelve consecutive months, or
whenever there is evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a
non-conforming use, such use shall not, after being discontinued or abandoned,
be re-established, and the use of the premises thereafter shall be in
conformity with the regulations of the district.
   (c)   Where no enclosed building is involved, discontinuance of a non-
conforming use for a period of six months shall constitute abandonment, and
shall not thereafter be used in a non-conforming manner.
   (d)   A non-conforming use not authorized by the provisions of this Zoning
Code, in effect at the time an amendatory ordinance becomes effective, shall be
discontinued and not re-established, except when the provisions of the
amendatory ordinance find the use to be conforming to the district in which it
is then located.
(1977 Code § 73-302)
1266.03 CHANGE OF NON-CONFORMING USE.
   The non-conforming use of any building, structure or portion thereof, which
is designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is
located, may be changed to another non-conforming use thereof but only if such
other use is permitted by a special use permit as authorized in
Chapter 1242.
(1977 Code § 73-303)
1266.04 TERMINATION AND REMOVAL OF NON-CONFORMING USES OF BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES
OR LAND.
   The period of time during which the following non-conforming uses of
buildings, structures or land may continue or remain shall be limited from the
effective date of this Zoning Code, or an amendment thereto which causes the
use to be non-conforming. Every such non-conforming use shall be completely
removed from the premises at the expiration of the period of time specified
below:
   (a)   Any non-conforming use of a building or structure, having an assessed
valuation not in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00) on the effective date
of this Zoning Code, shall be removed after two years.
   (b)   Any non-conforming use of land where no enclosed building is involved,
or where the only buildings employed are accessory or incidental to such use,
or where such use is maintained in connection with a conforming building, shall
be removed after a period of two years.
   (c)   A non-conforming sign shall be removed if the Zoning Administrator
determines that the sign constitutes a safety hazard or if it is altered or
modified to advertise a different business, product or service from that
advertised upon the effective date of this amendment.
   (d)   Any non-conforming house trailer shall be removed after a period of
five years.
   (e)   The finding at any time that a non-conforming structure or building
has reached or exceeded the normal useful life of such structure or building
shall be grounds for terminating the non-conforming use. The City Council, upon
recommendation of the Planning Commission, may, at any time, find, determine
and fix the normal useful life of a non-conforming building or structure and
may, for such purpose, require the production of income tax returns and other
pertinent information from the owner. The economic life stated in such income
tax returns for depreciation shall be a presumption as to the normal useful
life.
(1977 Code § 73-304)
1266.05 REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS.
   (a)   Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing a non-
conforming use is permitted, including necessary non-structural repairs and
incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the non-conforming use.
   (b)   No structural alteration shall be made in a building or other
structure containing a non-conforming use, except in the following situations:
      (1)   When the alteration is required by law.
      (2)   When the alteration will actually result in eliminating the non-
conforming use.
      (3)   When a building in a residential district containing residential
non-conforming uses may be altered in any way to improve livability, provided
that no structural alterations shall be made which would increase the number of
dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
(1977 Code § 73-305)
1266.06 DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION.
   Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a building or other
structure containing a non-conforming use is damaged or destroyed by any means
to the extent of fifty percent or more of its replacement value at that time,
the building or other structure can be rebuilt or used thereafter only for a
conforming use and in compliance with the provisions of the district in which
it is located. In the event the damage or destruction is less than fifty
percent of its replacement value, based upon prevailing costs, the building may
then be restored to its original condition and the occupancy or use of such
building, which existed at the time of such partial destruction, may be
continued. A non-conforming residential use within a Limited Manufacturing
District shall be exempt from the provisions of this paragraph.
   In either event, restoration or repair of the building or other structure
must be started within a period of six months from the date of damage or
destruction and diligently prosecuted to completion.
(Ord. 97-68. Passed 12-1-97.)
1266.07 ADDITIONS AND ENLARGEMENTS.
   (a)   A non-conforming building may be enlarged or extended only if the
entire building is thereafter devoted to a conforming use and is made to
conform to all the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   No building partially occupied by a non-conforming use shall be
altered in such a way as to permit the enlargement or expansion of the space
occupied by such non-conforming use.
   (c)   No non-conforming use may be enlarged or extended in such a way as to
occupy any required usable open space, or any land beyond the boundaries of the
zoning lot as it existed on the effective date of this Zoning Code, or to
displace any conforming use in the same building or on the same parcel.
   (d)   A building or structure which is non-conforming with respect to yards,
floor area ratio, or any other element of bulk regulated herein, shall not be
altered or expanded in any manner which would increase the degree or extent of
its non-conformity with respect to the bulk regulations of the district in
which it is located.
(1977 Code § 73-307)
1266.08 EXEMPTED BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES.
   Wherever a lawfully existing building or other structure otherwise conforms
to the use regulations herein, but is non-conforming only in the particular
manner hereinafter specified, the building, structure and use thereof shall be
exempt from the requirements of Sections
1266.04 and
1266.05.
   (a)   In any residential district where a dwelling is non-conforming only as
to the number of dwelling units it contains, provided no such building shall be
altered in any way so as to increase the number of dwelling units therein;
   (b)   In any residential district where a use permitted in the B-1 District
occupies ground floor space within a multiple-family dwelling located on a
corner lot;
   (c)   In any business or manufacturing district where the use is less
distant from a residential district than that specified in the regulations for
the district in which it is located; or
   (d)   In any district where an established building, structure or use is
non-conforming with respect to the standards prescribed herein for any of the
following:
      (1)   Floor area ratio;
      (2)   Yards, front, side, rear or transitional;
      (3)   Off-street parking or loading;
      (4)   Building height; or
      (5)   Gross floor area.
(1977 Code § 73-308)
1266.09 CONVERSION TO SPECIAL USE.
   Any non-conforming use may be made a special use by the granting of a
special use permit, as authorized in Section
1242.07 et seq.

1268.01 USE AND BULK REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Use. No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or
occupied, and no building or part thereof, or other structure, shall be
erected, raised, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered, except in
conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it
is located.
   (b)   Bulk. All new buildings and structures shall conform to the building
regulations established herein for the district in which each building shall be
located, except that parapet walls, chimneys, cooling towers, elevator
bulkheads, fire towers, stacks and necessary mechanical appurtenances shall be
permitted to exceed the maximum height provisions when erected in accordance
with all other ordinances of the City.
(1977 Code § 73-203)
1268.02 LOT COVERAGE.
   (a)   Maintenance of Yards, Courts and Other Open Spaces. The maintenance of
yards, courts and other open spaces and the minimum lot area legally required
for a building shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such building,
or of the property on which it is located, as long as the building is in
existence. Further, no legally required yards, courts or other open space, or
minimum lot area allocated to any building, shall, by virtue of change of
ownership or for any other reason, be used to satisfy yard, court or other open
space or minimum lot area requirements for any other building.
   (b)   Division of Zoning Lots. No improved zoning lot shall hereafter be
divided into two or more zoning lots, unless all improved zoning lots resulting
from each such division shall conform with all applicable bulk regulations of
the zoning district in which the property is located. However, with respect to
the resubdivision of improved zoning lots in the R-5, R-6 and R-7 Districts,
side yard requirements shall not apply between attached buildings.
   (c)   Location of Required Open Space. All yards, courts and other open
spaces allocated to a building or dwelling group shall be located on the same
zoning lot as such building or dwelling group.
   (d)   Required Yards for Existing Buildings. No yards now or hereafter
provided for a building existing on the effective date of this Zoning Code
shall subsequently be reduced below, or further reduced below if already less
than, the minimum yard requirements of this Zoning Code for equivalent new
construction.
   (e)   Permitted Obstructions in Required Yards. The following shall not be
considered to be obstructions when located in the required yards specified:
      (1)   In all yards. Open terraces not over four feet above the average
level of the adjoining ground, but not including a permanently roofed-over
terrace or porch; awnings and canopies; steps, four feet or less above grade,
which are necessary for access to a permitted building or for access to a
zoning lot from a street or alley; chimneys projecting eighteen inches or less
into the yard; and arbors, trellises and flag poles. Mesh-type fences having a
height of six feet or less may be used to locate property lines within the
required side or rear yards in residential districts.
         Fences, walls or lattice-work screens which form outside living rooms
or provide necessary privacy for swimming pools or other activities, and are
actual projections from the bearing walls of existing dwellings, may be
extended into either the side or the rear yards, but not both yards where the
fence, wall or screen has not less than fifty percent of the surface open or is
a vertical type of louvered fence, which can prevent free movement of air from
one or more directions and yet have more than fifty percent of its surface open
when viewed on an angle from two directions, provided, however:
         A.   That the projection shall not prohibit the erection of an open-
mesh type fence over six feet in height enclosing an elementary or high school
site; and
         B.   That this projection shall not limit the height, type or location
of a fence, wall or other structure which is located within the buildable area
exclusive of the side or rear yards of the property.
      (2)   In front yards. One-story bay windows projecting three feet or less
into the yard; and overhanging eaves and gutters projecting three feet or less
into the yard.
      (3)   In rear yards. Enclosed, attached or detached off-street parking
spaces; open off-street parking spaces; recreational and laundry-drying
equipment; accessory sheds, tool rooms and similar buildings or structures for
domestic or agricultural storage; balconies; breezeways and open porches; a
one-story bay window projecting three feet or less into the yard; and
overhanging eaves and gutters projecting three feet or less into the yard. In
any residential district, no accessory building shall be nearer than five feet
to the side lot line or nearer than ten feet to any principal building unless
it is attached.
      (4)   In side yards. Overhanging eaves and gutters projecting into a yard
for a distance not exceeding forty percent of the required yard width, but in
no case exceeding thirty inches.
   (f)   Vision Clearance at Corner Lots. No building or structure hereafter
erected, and no planting or other obstruction to the vision of drivers of motor
vehicles, shall be located:
      (1)   In any residential district, exceeding a height of three feet above
the street grade within twelve feet of the intersecting street lines bordering
corner lots; and
      (2)   In any business or manufacturing district, within eight feet of the
intersecting street lines bordering a corner lot, provided that this regulation
shall not apply to that part of a building above the first floor.
   (g)   Exceptions for Existing Developments.
      (1)   Where forty percent, or more, of the frontage on one side of a
street between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have
had (within a variation of five feet or less) a front yard greater in depth
than herein required, new buildings shall not be erected closer to the street
than the average front yard so established by the existing buildings.
      (2)   Where forty percent, or more, of the frontage on one side of a
street between two intersecting streets is developed with buildings that have
not had a front yard as herein required, then:
         A.   Where a building is to be erected within 100 feet of existing
buildings on both sides, the minimum front yard shall be a line drawn between
the closest front corners of the two existing buildings.
         B.   Where a building is to be erected within 100 feet of an existing
building on one side only, it may be erected as close to the street as the
existing building.
      (3)   This subsection shall apply to all lots, including reverse corner
lots, in all districts, and it shall take precedence over all over provisions
of this Zoning Code regarding setback lines or yard areas in residential
districts.
   (h)   Front Yards in Reverse Corner Lots. In all residential districts,
reverse corner lots, except when subject to the provisions of subsection (g)
hereof, shall be subject to the front yard setback requirements of their zoning
district for each yard adjoining a street, i.e. such reverse corner lots shall
have two front yards.
   (i)   Back Yards in Reverse Corner Lots. In all residential districts, the
back yard of a reverse corner lot shall be one of the two yards opposite the
yard fronting on a street, and of such two yards it shall be the one having the
greatest depth.
   (j)   Television Satellite Dishes or Antennae. Television satellite dishes
or antennae for receiving television signals from orbiting satellites or from
other sources may be located only in side yards or rear yards in locations to
be shown on building permits to be obtained from the Community Development
Director and to be approved by him or her. Such dishes or antennae shall be
considered structures and shall require a building permit before the same may
be erected. No such dishes or antennae shall exceed thirty feet in height from
ground level.
   (k)   PV Arrays. With respect to PV arrays as defined in Section
1240.06 (164), the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Ground mounted PV arrays shall not be deemed buildings or accessory
buildings for any purposes hereof; and
      (2)   Ground mounted PV arrays shall not be allowed as obstructions in
any required yard

1268.03 LOT AREA AND DIMENSIONS.
   (a)   Contiguous Parcels. When two or more parcels of land, each of which
lacks adequate area and dimensions to qualify for a permitted use under the
requirements of the use district in which it is located, are contiguous and are
held in one ownership, they shall be used as one zoning lot for such use.
   (b)   Lots or Parcels of Land of Record. Any single lot or parcel of land,
held in one ownership, which was of record at the time of adoption of this
Zoning Code, that does not meet the requirements for minimum lot width and
area, may be utilized for a permitted use, provided that yards, courts or
usable open spaces are not less than seventy-five percent of the minimum
required dimensions or areas.
(1977 Code § 73-205)
1268.04 ACCESS TO PUBLIC STREETS.
   Except as otherwise provided for herein, every building shall be constructed
or erected upon a lot or parcel of land which abuts upon a public street,
unless a permanent easement of access to a public street was of record prior to
the adoption of this Zoning Code.
(1977 Code § 73-206)
1268.05 NUMBER OF BUILDINGS ON A ZONING LOT.
   Except in the case of a planned development, not more than one principal
detached residential building shall be located on a residential zoning lot, nor
shall a principal detached residential building be located on the same zoning
lot with any other principal building.
(1977 Code § 73-207)
1268.06 REZONING OF PUBLIC AND SEMI-PUBLIC AREAS.
   An area indicated on the Zoning Map as a public park, recreation area,
public school site, cemetery, or other similar open space, shall not be used
for any other purpose than that designated; and when the use of the area is
discontinued, it shall automatically be zoned to the most restricted adjoining
district until appropriate zoning is authorized by the City Council within
three months after the date of the application filed for rezoning.
(1977 Code § 73-208)
1268.07 ACCESSORY BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Location. When a side yard is required, no part of an accessory
building shall be located closer than five feet to the side lot line along such

   (a)   Within sixty days after the effective date of this chapter, and from
time to time thereafter, or when brought to his or her attention, the Building
Inspector shall evaluate any and all buildings in the City he or she believes
to be unoccupied and make a determination for each as to whether the building

determination. For buildings the Building Inspector determines to be "vacant
buildings", he/she shall, within fourteen days of making that determination,
send a notice of determination with the findings to the last taxpayer of record
listed on the most recent Stephenson County tax roll. Said notice of
determination shall be sent certified mail, return receipt requested. Failure

determination, or after receipt of a denial of appeal, if the owner does
appeal, the owner shall either confirm the tentative date for the inspection or
shall request a reschedule for a new date and time for same, which shall be set
by the Building Inspector within thirty days of the date of the determination.

disputes the Building Inspector's determination, shall set forth specific facts
in support thereof, and shall include all evidence the owner relies upon to

persuade the Building Commissioner that it is more likely than not that the
subject building is not a "vacant building" within the meaning of this chapter.
   (c)   The Building Commissioner shall send written notice of his or her
decision to the owner within twenty-one days of his or her receipt of the
appeal. The Building Commissioner may, but is not required to, seek additional

thereof to the owner, take no more than twenty-one additional days to decide
the appeal if he or she determines that such additional time is required for
consideration of the appeal.
   (d)   An owner who wishes to challenge applicability of this chapter to his/
her building without the Building Inspector's determination having been made
shall set forth specific facts to support nonapplicability in writing to the
Building Inspector, in the event the Building Inspector determines that the
subject building is a "vacant building," the owner shall have the right to

and file an amended registration within fifteen days of any change in the
information contained in the annual registration. A new registration is

   (d)   Registration does not exonerate the owner from compliance with all

elsewhere in the City code.
   (e)   Inspection.
      (1)   The City shall conduct a comprehensive code compliance inspection

1430.04. Timely code compliance is required.
   (f)   Vacant Building Plan.

materials (including garbage, cleaning wastes, wastewater, toxic materials, or
hazardous materials) shall be disposed of following all federal, state and
local regulations;
      (4)   Stabilized construction entrance. Each site shall have a stabilized
construction entrance installed to prevent sediment from being tracked onto
public or private roadways;
      (5)   Culvert and inlet protection. All on-site storm culverts and
inlets, and the impacted off-site downstream culverts and inlets shall be
protected with appropriate best management practices;
      (6)   Runoff control. Runoff from the entire disturbed area on the site
shall be controlled by all appropriate best management practices. If a channel
or area of concentrated runoff passes through or adjacent to the site, silt
fences shall be placed along the channel edges. Attention shall be given to the
land area and slopes to be controlled before choosing an appropriate best
management practices;

imminent threat to the safety of persons or property that immediate destruction
or cure is necessary and ordering the immediate demolition or other immediate
abatement.
   (b)   If authorized by Court order, the City's costs of any demolition,
repair or enclosure, or removal of garbage, debris and other hazardous, noxious
or unhealthy substances, including Court costs, attorney's fees and other costs
related to the enforcement of this chapter, are recoverable from the owner or
owners of such real estate and are a lien upon such real estate, which lien is
superior to all prior existing liens and encumbrances, except taxes, provided
that within 180 days after such repair, demolition, enclosure or removal, a
notice of lien of such costs and expenses is filed in the office of the County
Recorder.

redemption period described in subsection (b) of Section 15-1603 of the Code of
Civil Procedure (Chapter 110, paragraph 15-1603), as amended, shall end sixty

1456.12 ABANDONED PROPERTY.
   (a)   In addition to any other remedy provided in this chapter or otherwise
by law, the City may petition the Circuit Court to have property declared
abandoned if:
      (1)   The property has been tax delinquent for two or more years;
      (2)   The property is unoccupied by persons legally in possession; and
      (3)   The property contains a dangerous and unsafe building.
   (b)   All persons having an interest of record in the property, including
tax purchasers and beneficial owners of any Illinois Land Trust having title to
the property, shall be named as defendants in the petition and shall be served
with process, which shall be served pursuant to Section 2-206 of the Code of
Civil Procedure (Chapter 110, paragraph 2-206), as amended, as in other cases
affecting property.
   (c)   If it is proven that the conditions described in this section exist,
and an owner of record of the property does not enter an appearance in the
action, or if title to the property is held by an Illinois Land Trust and
neither the owner of record nor the owner of the beneficial of such Trust
enters an appearance, the court shall declare the property abandoned.
   If such a determination is made, notice shall be sent by certified or
registered mail to all persons having an interest of record in the property,
including tax purchasers and beneficial owners of any Illinois Land Trust
having titles to the property, stating that title to such property will be
transferred to the City unless, within thirty days of such notice, the owner of
record enters an appearance in the action, or unless any other person having an
interest in the property files with the court a request to demolish the
dangerous and unsafe building or to put the building in a safe condition.
   If the owner of record enters an appearance in the action within the thirty-
day period, the Court shall vacate its order declaring the property abandoned.
In such case, the City may amend its complaint in order to initiate proceedings
under Section
1456.11. If a request to demolish or repair the building is filed within the
thirty-day period, the Court shall grant permission to the requesting party to
demolish the building within thirty days or to restore the building to a safe
condition within sixty days after the request is granted. An extension of such
period may be given for good cause. If more than one person with an interest in
the property files a timely request, preference shall be given to the person
with the lien or other interest of the highest priority.
   If the requesting party proves to the Court that the building has been
demolished or put in a safe condition within the period of time granted by the
Court, the Court shall issue a quit claim judicial deed for the property to the
requesting party, conveying only the interest of the owner of record upon proof
of payment to the City of all costs incurred by the City in connection with the
action, including, but not limited to, Court costs, attorney's fees,
administrative costs and the costs, if any, associated with building enclosure
or removal. The interest in the property so conveyed shall be subject to all
liens and encumbrances thereon. In addition, if the interest is conveyed to a
person holding a certificate of purchase for the property under the Revenue Act
of 1939 (Chapter 120, paragraphs 482 et seq.), the conveyance shall be subject
to the rights of redemption of all persons entitled to redeem under that Act,
including the original owner of record.
   (d)   If no person with an interest in the property files a timely request,
or if the requesting party fails to demolish the building or put the building
in a safe condition within the time specified by the Court, the Municipality
may petition the Court to issue a judicial deed for the property to the City.
Conveyance by such judicial deed shall operate to extinguish all existing
ownership interest in, liens on and other interests in the property, including
tax liens.

(Ord. 2005-59. Passed 11-21-05.)
1460.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent probability of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-
year flood. The base flood elevation at any location is as defined in Section
1460.04.
   (b)   "Base flood elevation (BFE)" means the elevation in relation to mean
sea level of the crest of the base flood.
   (c)   "Building" means a walled and roofed structure that is principally
above ground including manufactured homes, prefabricated buildings and gas or
liquid storage tanks. The term "building" also includes recreational vehicles
and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty
(180) days per year.
   (d)   "Critical facility" means any facility which is critical to the health
and welfare of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension
to the disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of
vital services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or
can put special populations at risk.
   Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required
include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations),
schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major roads
and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or electrical
transformers, and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals,
petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances).
   (e)   "Development" means any man-made change to real estate, including, but
not limited to:
      (1)   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair or placement of a
new building or any structural alteration to a building;
      (2)   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
      (3)   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for
a manufactured home or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days per year;
      (4)   Installation of utilities, construction of roads, bridges, culverts
or similar projects;
      (5)   Construction or erection of levees, dams, walls, or fences;
      (6)   Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving or
other alterations of the ground surface;
      (7)   Storage of materials including the placement of gas and liquid
storage tanks;
      (8)   Channel modifications; and
      (9)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height or
velocity of flood or surface water.

buildings and facilities, resurfacing roads, or gardening, plowing and similar
practices that do not involve filling, grading or construction of levees.
   (f)   "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed or buildings to be
constructed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of
concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
   (g)   "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means
the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including
the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final

   (i)   "Flood" means a general and temporary condition of partial to complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation or the run-off of surface waters from any source.
   (j)   "Flood fringe" means that portion of the floodplain outside of the
regulatory floodway.
   (k)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map" means a map prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard
area (SFHA) within a community. This map includes insurance rate zones and may
or may not depict floodways and show base flood elevations.
   (l)   "Flood Insurance Study" means an examination, evaluation and
determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface
elevations.
   (m)   "Floodplain" and "Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)" are synonymous,
and mean those lands within the jurisdiction of the City, the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the City, or that may be annexed into the City, that are
subject to inundation by the base flood. The floodplains of the Pecatonica
River and Yellow Creek are generally identified as such on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map prepared for Stephenson County by FEMA and dated March 16, 2015. The
floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Stephenson County that are within
the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City or that may be annexed into the
City are generally identified as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared
for Stephenson County by FEMA and dated March 16, 2015. Floodplain also
includes those areas of known flooding as identified by the City.
   (n)   "Flood proofing" means any combination of structural or nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate, property and their contents.

shall be as delineated on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Stephenson
County prepared by FEMA and dated March 16, 2015. The floodways for each of the
remaining floodplains of the City shall be according to the best data available
from Federal, State, or other sources.
   (r)   "FPE" or "flood protection elevation" means the elevation of the base
flood plus one foot of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
   (s)   "Freeboard" means an increment of elevation added to the base flood
elevation to provide a factor of safety for uncertainties in calculations,
future watershed development, unknown localized conditions, wave actions and
unpredictable effects such as those caused by ice or debris jams.
   (t)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or
preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the
requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

specific types of activities by issuance of a statewide permit which meets the
standards defined in Section
1460.06.
   (v)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor or the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of Section
1460.07.
   (w)   "Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more
sections that is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with
or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.

management regulations adopted by a community.
   (aa)   "NFIP" means National Flood Insurance Program.
   (bb)   "Repetitive loss" means flood-related damages sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten year period for which the
costs of repairs at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or
exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (cc)   "SFHA." See definition of floodplain.
   (dd)   "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and means
the date the building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or
other improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage
of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a
substantial improvement, actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   (ee)   "Structure" (see "Building").
   (ff)   "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a

determination. This term includes "repetitive loss buildings" (see definition).
   (gg)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or improvement of a structure taking place during a ten (10) year
period in which the cumulative percentage of improvements:
      (1)   equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
      (2)   increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
   "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive
loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done. The term
does not include:
      (1)   any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places.
   (hh)   "Travel trailer" (or recreational vehicle) means a vehicle which is:
      (1)   built on a single chassis;
      (2)   four hundred (400) square feet or less in size;
      (3)   designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (ii)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the required federal, state, and/or
local permits and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until
such time as the documentation is provided

Passed 11-5-18.)
1460.04 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION DATA.
   The protection standard of this chapter is the base flood. The best
available base flood data are listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the
best available data, the party shall finance the detailed engineering study
needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to FEMA and
IDNR/OWR for approval prior to any development of the site.
   (a)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of Pecatonica River and

determine base flood elevations.
   (d)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of those parts of
unincorporated Stephenson County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the City or that may be annexed into the City shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of
Stephenson County prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated
March 16, 2015.
(Ord. 2005-59. Passed 11-21-05; Ord. 2011-07. Passed 2-7-11; Ord. 2015-07.
Passed 1-20-15.)
1460.05 DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
   No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Community Development Director. The Community
Development Director shall not issue a development permit if the proposed
development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (a)   The application for a development permit shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions;
      (2)   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      (3)   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings;
      (4)   The elevation of the lowest floor (including the basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of Section

or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
   (b)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the Community
Development Director shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to
be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled
after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map is not in the
floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood
elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current Flood
Insurance Rate Map is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   The Community Development Director shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance
Rate Map identification.
   The Community Development Director shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals
or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity.
The Community Development Director shall not issue a permit unless all other
federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.

   In addition, the City shall notify adjacent communities in writing thirty
(30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of
the watercourse.
(Ord. 2011-07. Passed 2-7-11.)
1460.11 VARIANCES.
   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Board of Zoning Appeals
for a variance. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to Council. Council
may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary
to further the intent of this chapter.
   (a)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing or repairs to roads, utilities or other
public facilities;
      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      (7)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (b)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant, in writing,
that a variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of
Section
1460.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with the knowledge of these
risks and that the applicant acknowledge, in writing, the assumption of the
risk and liability.
   (c)   Historic Structures.
      (1)   Variances to the building protection requirements of Section
1460.07 which are requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or
alteration of a site or historic structure as defined in Section
1460.02 may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
Sections
1460.06 and
1460.07 subject to the conditions that:
         A.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         B.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
   (d)   Agriculture.
      (1)   Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided
individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique
circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well as
those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and
the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be
included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are
constructed at-grade and wet-flood proofed.
         A.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
         B.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM).
         C.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with
Section
1460.07.
         D.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with Section
1460.07. All of the building's structural components must be capable of
resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
         E.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or flood proofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, flood proofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with Section
1460.07.
         F.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to
the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters in accordance with Section
1460.07.
         G.   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of Section
1460.06. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures within any
designated floodway.
         H.   Wet-flood proofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the Community Development Director and a licensed professional
engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development
permit for construction.
(Ord. 2005-59. Passed 11-21-05; Ord. 2011-07. Passed 2-7-11.)
1460.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside of the
floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully hereunder.
(Ord. 2005-59. Passed 11-21-05; Ord. 2011-07. Passed 2-7-11.)
1460.13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by City to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program including
Ordinance 2005-59 dated November 21, 2005. However, this chapter does not
repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in
the Program, nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinances, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2011-07. Passed 2-7-11.)
1460.14 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and
the invalidity of any portion of this chatper shall not affect the validity of
the remainder.
(Ord. 2011-07. Passed 2-7-11.)
1460.99 VIOLATIONS; REMEDIES; PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Community Development
Director may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this
chapter exists. The Community Development Director shall notify the owner, in
writing, of such violation.
   (a)   If such owner fails, after ten days notice, to correct the violation:
      (1)   The City may make application to the Stephenson County Circuit
Court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such
other order as the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with this
chapter;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      (4)   The City shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property;
   (b)   Community Development Director shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damage and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   The Community Development Director is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in
writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if
necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop
work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      (1)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation, and
      (2)   The time and place of the hearing.
   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present
evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (c)   Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

   (a)   Permitted Locations. Off-premises signs are allowed in business,
commercial, manufacturing, agricultural and flood plain zoned areas.
   (b)   Size. No off-premises sign may be erected which exceeds 672 square
feet in area, fourteen feet in height and forty-eight feet in length. This
includes border and trim, but excludes an ornamental base or apron, supports
and other structural members. The maximum size limitation shall apply to each
side of a sign or sign structure. A maximum of two signs may be erected in a
facing, in which event the facing shall be deemed to be one sign, and the size
of the facing may not exceed the dimensions listed above. Signs may be doubled-
faced, placed back to back or V-type in which the maximum angle of the two
facings shall not exceed forty-five degrees. The area shall be measured by the
smallest square, rectangle, triangle, circle or combination thereof which will
encompass the entire sign.
   (c)   Lighting.
      (1)   No sign may be erected or maintained which is not effectively
shielded, as to prevent beams or rays of light from being directed at any
portion of the traveled way, or which is of such intensity or brilliance as to
cause glare or to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle.
   (d)   Spacing. No off-premises sign twelve feet by twenty-five feet or less
in size may be erected within 100 feet of an existing off-premises sign of any
size or of an existing off-premises sign structure, located on the same side of

than twelve feet by twenty-five feet in size may be erected within 200 feet of
an existing off-premises sign of any size or of an existing off-premises sign
structure, located on the same side of the right of way and facing in the same
direction. A sign structure may have one or two facings with a maximum of two
signs per facing. Back to back and side to side signs or V-type signs, in which
the maximum angle of the facings shall be forty-five degrees, shall be treated
as a single-sign structure. The foregoing requirements on spacing between
structures shall not apply to structures which are separated or screened by
buildings, natural surroundings or other obstructions if only one sign facing
located within such distance is visible at any one time. No off-premises sign
shall be placed, erected or maintained within 150 feet from the boundary line

1468.33 VARIANCES.
   (a)   The City Council may authorize such variances from, and exceptions to,
the application of the terms, regulations and requirements of this Sign Code,
where the strict and literal application of the Code would create a particular
hardship for the applicant.
   (b)   Effect of Denial of Variance. No application for a variance to this
chapter which has been denied wholly or in part by the City Council shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the City Council action
denying the application, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of changed
conditions found to be a valid ground for waiver of this one-year limitation by
the Building Commission and by the City Council.
   (c)   Standards for Granting Applications for Variances. Variances to this
chapter may be granted:
      (1)   To prevent undue hardship:
      (2)   To permit reasonable use of property:
      (3)   If it will alleviate some demonstrable, practical and peculiar
difficulty;
      (4)   For public or private convenience and necessity, not as a matter of
absolute necessity, but of reasonable need and expediency;
      (5)   When the plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances;
      (6)   If denial would amount to a practical confiscation of property as
distinguished from mere inconvenience;
      (7)   If its primary function and purpose is not to produce a monopoly in
the area;
      (8)   Not merely as a matter of economic convenience or advantage;
      (9)   Only in such manner as to minimize the effect of such relief upon
adjacent property and to preserve the essential character of the area;

good;
      (11)   Only if it may be done without substantially impairing the general
purpose and intent of this Building and Housing Code;

traffic conditions, property values, public utility service, schools, parks,
recreational facilities, and other matters pertaining to the public health,
safety and welfare;
      (13)   If it will not unduly increase the population or intensity of land
use of the area;
      (14)   Only if such of the above standards as are pertinent and
applicable are answerable in a manner favorable to the application;
      (15)   Only if it will not impede the normal and orderly development and

this Building and Housing Code and the Fire Prevention Code.
   (e)   Expiration of Authorization. If work, construction or use has not

Zoning Appeals, the City Council, without further public hearing, may grant or
reject any proposed variance, or may refer it back to the Board of Zoning

   A community survives and improves by capitalizing on its assets and
attributes. Community improvement is necessary and important. The public
interest and well-being require that guidelines and controls are used not to
inhibit or constrain improvement, but rather to shape and channel such activity
to the benefit of the community. Freeport can meet the needs of the future and
provide a basis for long-range planning by identifying, utilizing, and
developing its current assets. Such planning draws from both the past and the
present to illuminate the passageway to the future. It is the purpose of this
chapter to promote the protection, enhancement, perpetuation of improvements of
special character or historical interest or value in the interest of the
health, prosperity, safety, and welfare of the people of the City of Freeport
by:
   (a)   Providing a mechanism to identify and preserve the historic and
architectural characteristics of Freeport which represent elements of the
City's cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history;
   (b)   Promoting civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the
past as represented in Freeport's landmarks and historic districts;
   (c)   Stabilizing and improving the economic vitality and value of
Freeport's landmarks and historic areas;
   (d)   Protecting and enhancing the attractiveness of the City to buyers,
visitors and shoppers and thereby supporting business, commerce, industry, and
providing economic benefit to the City;
   (e)   Fostering and encouraging preservation, restoration of structures,
areas, and neighborhoods and thereby preventing future urban blight.

1475.19 CERTIFICATE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.
   This process enables the Commission to determine whether a property owner
will lose all reasonable use of the property if the Certificate of
Appropriateness is denied. It is an important finding when claims of a "taking
of private property without just compensation" (U.S. Constitution) are made.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the ordinance to the contrary, the
Commission may issue a Certificate of Economic Hardship to allow the
performance of work for which a Certificate of Appropriateness has been denied.
   (a)   Applicants claiming economic hardship shall be required to apply to
the Commission to determine eligibility for rehabilitation assistance, if any
is available. The eligibility for and availability of financial aid shall be
considered by the Commission in making it decision.
   (b)   An applicant for a Certificate of Economic Hardship may submit any or
all of the following information in order to assist the Commission in making
its determination on the application:
      (1)   The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the
party from whom purchased (including a description of the relationship, if any,
between the owner and the person from whom the property was purchased).
      (2)   The assessed value of the land and improvements thereon according
to the two most recent assessments.
      (3)   Real estate taxes for the previous two years.
      (4)   Remaining balance on mortgage, if any, and annual debt service, if
any, for the previous two years.
      (5)   All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the owner
or applicant in connection with this purchase, financing or ownership of the
property.
      (6)   Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and
offers received, if any.
      (7)   Any consideration by the owner as to profitable adaptive use for
the property.
      (8)   If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from
the property for the previous two years. Itemized operating and maintenance
expenses for the previous two years, and annual cash flow before and after debt
service, if any, during the same period.
      (9)   Form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole
proprietorship, for-profit, or not for-profit corporation, limited partnership,
joint venture or other.
      (10)   Any other information including the income tax bracket of the
owner, applicant, or principal investors in the property, reasonably necessary
for a determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used or yield
a reasonable return to present or future owners.
   (c)   If the Commission finds that without approval of the proposed work,
the property cannot obtain a reasonable economic return therefrom, then the
application shall be delayed for a period not to exceed three (3) months.
During this period of delay, the Commission shall investigate plans and make
recommendations to the City Council to allow for a reasonable beneficial use or
a reasonable economic return, or to otherwise preserve the subject property.
Such plans and recommendations may include, but not be limited to: a relaxation
of the provisions of the ordinance, a reduction in real property taxes,
financial assistance, building code modifications, and/or changes in zoning
regulations.
   (d)   If, by the end of this three (3) month period, the Commission has
found that without approval of the proposed work the property cannot be put to
reasonable beneficial use or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic
return therefrom, then the Commission shall issue a Certificate of Economic
Hardship approving the proposed work. If the Commission finds otherwise, it
shall deny application for a Certificate of Economic Hardship.
   (e)   Appeals.
      (1)   When a Certificate of Appropriateness or a Certificate of Economic
Hardship is approved or denied for either a landmark or a structure within an
Historic District, the applicant or any interested party may, within thirty
(30) days, appeal the Commission's decision to the City Manager. The City
Manager may receive comments on the contents of the record, but no new matter
may be considered by the City Manager. The City Manager may affirm the decision
or recommend changes after due consideration of the facts contained in the
record submitted to the City Manager by the Commission. The City Manager may
overturn the Commission's decision. If the City Manager decides that a
Certification of Economic Hardship should be issued, the City Clerk shall
notify the applicant and the Secretary of the Commission within seven (7) days
of the City Manager’s decision, and the Secretary of the Commission then shall
issue the permit within fifteen (15) days.
      (2)   If the City Manager concurs with the Commission's decision not to
issue a Certificate of Economic Hardship, the City Clerk shall notify the
applicant and the Secretary of the Commission within seven (7) days. The City
Manager’s decision in this matter shall be final subject only to judicial
review as provided by law.

site within an Historic Preservation District or of a landmark, the owner will
be required to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Commission
prior to reconstruction if municipal monies are expended on the project or
complete a mandatory review before a permit is issued by the City of Freeport.
Although exact duplication of the previous structure may not be required, the
exterior design of the property shall be in harmony with the exterior design of
the structure prior to damage, and the character of the Historic Preservation
District.
(Ord. 2002-78. Passed 1-6-03.)
1475.99 PENALTY.
   The Commission may establish an appropriate system of processing fees for
the review of nominations, mandatory review, and Certificates of
Appropriateness. Any person who undertakes or causes an alteration,
construction, demolition, or removal of any nominated or designated landmark or
property within a nominated or designated landmark or designated Historic
District without a Certificate of Appropriateness or mandatory review shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine
of not less than fifty dollars ($50) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars

Building Codes, the Community Development Director shall promptly issue a
permit for the construction of the facility in accordance with the application.
Provided, that if the Community Development Director, in his or her reasonably

(Ord. 2018-40. Passed 9-17-18.)
1477.12 SOLAR ACCESS.
   In order to preserve access to solar resources by all residents, the
following provisions restrict the construction of structures on adjacent lots
which may cause a significant decrease in the amount of available sunlight to a
particular lot.
   (a)   Solar Access Areas. Two solar access areas are hereby established as
defined below. The purpose of dividing the City into solar access areas is to
provide solar access protection for each area of the City consistent with
planned densities, topography and lot configurations and orientations.
      (1)   Solar access area I (SA-1) - SA-1 is designed to protect solar
access principally for residential areas where, because of planned density,
topography or lot configurations or orientations, the preponderance of lots
therein currently enjoy such access and where solar access of this nature would
not unduly restrict permissible development. SA-1 includes all property in all
Residential (R1 through R-6), Professional Use (P-1), and Agricultural (A-1)
Districts.
      (2)   Solar access area II (SA-2) - SA-2 is designed to protect solar
access principally for rooftops in areas where, because of planned density,
topography or lot configuration or orientation, the preponderance of lots
therein currently enjoy such access and where solar access of this nature would
not unduly restrict permissible development. SA-2 includes all property not
included in SA-1.
   (b)   Solar Access Protection.
      (1)   Solar fence. A solar fence is hereby hypothesized for each lot
located in the City. Each solar fence completely encloses the lot in question,
and its foundation is contiguous with the lot lines. Such fence is vertical, is
opaque and lacks any thickness. Said concept shall be applied to all
calculations required by this section. The term "solar fence" as used
throughout this section shall refer to such hypothetical fence specifically as
described in this subsection.
      (2)   No person shall erect an object or structure on any other lot that
would shade a protected lot in SA-1 to a greater degree than the lot would be
shaded by a solar fence twelve feet in height, between two hours before and two
hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day.
      (3)   No person shall erect an object or structure on any other lot that
would shade a protected lot in SA-2 to a greater degree than the lot would be
shaded by a solar fence twenty-five feet in height, between two hours before
and two hours after local solar noon on a clear winter solstice day.
      (4)   Maximum height. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, nothing in this section prevents a structure in SA-1 from being erected
up to a height of twenty-five feet, or a structure in SA-2 from being erected
up to a height of thirty-five feet, if located within the allowed buildable
area of the lot.
      (5)   Any application for a variance of any requirement of this section
shall include, in addition to the requirements for variations generally as set
forth in these Codified Ordinances, the following:
         A.   A graphic representation showing the shadows that would be cast
by the proposed structure between two hours before and two hours after local
solar noon on a clear winter solstice day;
         B.   The solar fences on all lots that the shadows would touch;
         C.   All possible obstructions of solar access protected by permit;
and
         D.   Provide additional information as may be required by the
Community Development Director.
      (6)   Existing structures. A structure in existence on the date of
establishment of an applicable solar access area, or structures and vegetation
in existence on the date of issuance of an applicable solar access permit, are
exempt from the application of this section. For purposes of this section,
structures are deemed to be in existence on the date of issuance of a
development permit authorizing its construction.
      (7)   Temporary solar obstructions. Unavoidable temporary obstructions of
protected solar access necessitated by construction activities or other
necessary and lawful purposes are exempt to the extent that they do not exceed
ten days in any three month period and thirty days in any year.
      (8)   Solar analysis. When a solar analysis is required for any review
process, it shall be prepared in compliance with the methods described in
materials provided by the Community Development Director.
(Ord. 2018-40. Passed 9-17-18.)
1477.13 LICENSED CONTRACTORS.
   No work shall be performed on any solar energy system, nor any component
thereof, by any person who is not a licensed commercial contractor in the City
of Freeport, as defined by Section
1446.01.
(Ord. 2018-40. Passed 9-17-18.)
1477.14 SOLAR INTERCONNECTION TYPES.
   Solar interconnection shall be done by the following approved methods:
   (a)   Piercing or any other connector or lug must have a listing from UL or
other approved agency, must be rated for conductors on both the line and load
sides of the electrical service, must be dual rated for both AL (aluminum)/CU
(copper) wiring, and must be correctly rated for the size of the PV system.
   (b)   Meter adapters shall be allowed by Community Development Director and/
or Freeport Fire Marshall approval only.
   (c)   Back-Fed breakers or fuses must be rated for their use.
