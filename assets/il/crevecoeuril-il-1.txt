ADMINISTRATIVE
CHAPTER 1
VILLAGE CODE
SECTION:
1-1-1: Title
1-1-2: Acceptance
1-1-3: Amendments
1-1-4: Interpretations
1-1-5: Code Of Conduct
1-1-1: TITLE:
Upon adoption by the board of trustees this code is hereby declared to be and
shall hereafter constitute the official village code of the village of Creve
Coeur. Any reference to the number of any section contained herein shall be
understood to refer to the position of the same under its appropriate chapter
and title heading, and to the general penalty clause relating thereto, as well
as to the section itself, when reference is made to this code by title in any
legal document. (1970 Code)
1-1-2: ACCEPTANCE:
This code, as hereby presented in printed form, shall hereafter be received
without further proof in all courts and in all administrative tribunals of this
state as the ordinances of the village of general and permanent effect. (1970
Code)
1-1-3: AMENDMENTS:
Any ordinance amending this code shall set forth the title, chapter and section
number of the section or sections to be amended, and this shall constitute a
sufficient compliance with any statutory requirement pertaining to the
amendment or revision by ordinance of any part of this code. All such
amendments or revisions by ordinance shall be immediately forwarded to Sterling
Codifiers, and the said ordinance material shall be prepared for insertion in
its proper place in each copy of this code. Each such replacement page shall be
properly identified and shall be inserted in each individual copy of this code
within thirty (30) days from the date of its final passage. (1970 Code)
1-1-4: INTERPRETATIONS:
In the determination of the provisions of each section of this code the
following rules shall be observed:
   (A)   Intent To Defraud: Whenever an intent to defraud is required in order
to constitute an offense, it shall be sufficient if an intent appears to
defraud any person.
   (B)   Liability Of Employers And Agents: When the provisions of any section
of this code prohibits the commission of an act, not only the person actually
doing the prohibited act or omitting the directed act, but also the employer
and all other persons concerned with or in aiding or abetting the said person
shall be guilty of the offense described and liable to the penalty set forth.
(1970 Code)
1-1-5: CODE OF CONDUCT:
The code of conduct of the village of Creve Coeur is predicated on the golden
rule which states, "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you". Village
meetings and hearings are forums for conducting the people's business in an
orderly and dignified way. Therefore there are certain standards of conduct
which are required:
   (A)   Board members and officials must not engage in verbal abuse of fellow
board members and officials, staff or members of the public. If any member or
official engages in such abuse, the member or official will be ruled out of
order by the chair and reprimanded by the board if such commentary continues.
   (B)   Citizens who are given the privilege of the floor to address the board
will not be permitted to verbally abuse board members, officials or village
employees. If there is a violation, the chair will interrupt the party, rule
the party out of order, and if such commentary continues, the violating party
will forfeit the privilege of addressing the village board. Complaints
regarding specific village employees can be submitted in writing to the office
of the mayor, the village clerk and/or a village board member, and/or other
relevant parties.
Under no circumstances will any portion of this code be used to limit strong
public debate on vital community issues or stifle the complete consideration of
divergent ideas, no matter how unpopular these ideas may be. Rather, the
purpose of this code of conduct is to ensure civility in the conduct of the
people's business. (Ord. 618, 2-10-2010)

any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new
ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied
to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect.
This Section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.

provision; nor shall this Chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,

of deposit, Treasury bills and other securities guaranteed by the U.S.
Government, participation in the State of Illinois Public Treasurer's

needs for the current month plus one month (based on forecasted needs) and any
reasonably anticipated special needs.
   (C)   Yield; Return On Investment: Within the constraints on Illinois law,
considerations of safety, and this investment policy, every effort should be
made to maximize return on investments made. All available funds will be placed
in investments or kept in interest-bearing deposit accounts.

considered and authorized only by the action of the Village Trustees upon the
recommendation of the Chief Investment Officer. The Chief Investment Officer

   (A)   Limitations On Class J And K Licenses:
      1.   The Village shall design and provide for all interested applicants
in the Office of the Village Clerk an application that describes the event's
hours, and expected attendance, the Village or library district owned property
to be used, the area where alcoholic beverages will be served, the type of
beverages to be served, who will serve the beverages, how the licensee will
prevent consumption of alcohol by minors, and proof of adequate dramshop
(liability) insurance coverage. The application shall be given to the Liquor
Commission or its designee who shall either approve or deny the application
within ten (10) working days.
      2.   The license is only valid for the specific Village or library
district owned property described in the license application and only for the
days and times as approved by the Liquor Commission or designee. Liquor may
only be served and consumed in a well-defined and designated area on Village or
library district owned property. The licensee must make sure that alcoholic
beverages do not leave the defined area.
      3.   The licensee must carry adequate dramshop liability insurance and
proof of purchase of insurance must be provided to the Village before the
event. If the licensee seeks to sell alcoholic beverages in a building or on
property owned or operated by the Village, as opposed to just serving alcohol
to attendees, the licensee must include the Village as an additional insured.
(If you are a private party, contact your homeowners' insurance provider to
determine how to obtain coverage for your event.)
      4.   A photocopy of the liquor license approval must be displayed on the
premises during any such function.
      5.   The service and consumption of alcoholic liquor shall only be
permitted on the premises and not outside of the premises. If the premises
where alcohol is to be served are out of doors (in a Village owned park), those
premises where alcohol is served must be clearly marked and alcohol may not be
removed from the clearly marked premises.
      6.   The service of alcoholic liquor must be by a person at least twenty
one (21) years of age who is an agent or employee of the licensee and the
licensee must implement measures to ensure that minors are not served alcoholic
liquors and do not consume alcoholic liquor on the premises.
      7.   No private event catered under this license shall exceed eight (8)
hours in duration and no alcoholic liquor shall be served earlier than ten
o'clock (10:00) A.M. and no later than one o'clock (1:00) A.M.
      8.   In the case of a K license for a public event, private security must
be employed by the licensee, unless the licensee is the Village itself or
library district itself, in proportion to the amount of people expected at the
event in consultation with the Creve Coeur Police Department. The cost of
security will be entirely paid for by the licensee. A K license will not be
granted without a security plan, approved by the CCPD and paid for by the
licensee.
      9.   In the case of a K license for a public event, after preliminary
approval from the Liquor Commission, the event is only given final approval
after a majority vote approving the same at a regularly scheduled and properly
noticed Village Board, or Library Board (only in the case that the library will
be used for the event) meeting.
      10.   The licensee shall comply with all applicable ordinances and State
law and obtain all applicable permits for the private catered event.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any licensee to sell or permit the
consumption of alcoholic liquor outside of the principal building located on
the licensed premises unless the license granted by the Local Liquor Control
Commission grants such right with respect to specifically delineated outside
areas shown on the site plan provided with the licensee's application. Where
outdoor sales and/or consumption have been approved, the approved outdoor area
must be enclosed with some permanent fencing or temporary enclosure (such as
plastic snow fencing), and the licensee shall require all ingress to and egress
from the licensed premises to take place through the principal building on the
premises and not through any openings in the outdoor enclosure. (Ord. 820B, 7-

This chapter shall apply to all new buildings and additions to buildings,
except:
   (A)   Temporary one-story buildings for use of builders.
   (B)   Wooden fences not over four feet six inches (4'6") high. (Ord. 267, 9-
27-1961)
   (C)   For "modular dwellings" as defined by section
10-1-2 of this code, the regulatory standards for the construction of modular
dwellings adopted by the Illinois department of public health shall apply
unless a specific standard in this code shall exist, in which case the
requirements of the building code shall control. (Ord. 550-A, 5-10-1995)
4-1-2-1: SHEDS, CARPORTS, GARAGES, AND OTHER DETACHED STRUCTURES:
   (A)   Definitions:
   CARPORT: A structure open on at least two (2) sides used generally for
covering vehicles. A carport is typically considered a "detached structure"
regardless of size and its proximity to the home or garage unless it is part of
a proper permitted and planned home addition. If the carport is not open on at
least two (2) sides, it shall be considered a garage and will have to comply
with all code requirements for a garage.
   DETACHED STRUCTURE: Any item erected or built on a property in the village
of Creve Coeur that is present on the property for longer than two (2) weeks. A
detached structure could be anything from an outbuilding or a tree house to a
tent. A detached structure is not a "portable storage container" which is
defined and regulated in section
10-14-14 of this code.
   GARAGE: An enclosed structure on three (3) or more sides that is used,
commonly for the parking of vehicles. Any detached structure over four hundred
(400) square feet (example, bigger than 20 by 20 feet or 16 by 25 feet) will be
considered a garage. All garages must be supported on continuous footings and
must meet all other requirements for garages as indicated elsewhere in this
code.
   SHED: A detached one- or multi-story structure, used for tool or equipment
storage, a playhouse or similar use, it does not exceed ten feet (10') tall at
the eave heights, the maximum distance that it can be off the ground is
eighteen inches (18"). Any structure that does not comply with these criteria
will be treated as any other detached structure. A shed is not a tent. A tent
cannot be used as a shed.
   (B)   Requirements For All Detached Structures:
      1.   Any detached structure of any type and any size must follow all
building code and zoning code requirements including setback requirements.
      2.   The construction or addition of any detached structure to a village
property requires a building permit. (Permit fees are listed on a schedule in
the office of the village clerk.)
      3.   Detached structures over two hundred (200) square feet must be
anchored to the ground, and must pass a final inspection.
      4.   Any detached structure over two hundred fifty six (256) square feet
must have a permanent foundation system (at least 12 inches below final grade,
typically including concrete piers).
      5.   No detached structure may be placed closer than five feet (5') from
any property line nor may it be placed closer than twelve inches (12") from any
other detached structure, garage or dwelling.
      6.   Detached structures may only be placed in side or rear yards.
      7.   Regardless of size, if the structure will have electricity, it must
have an electrical permit and pass a final electrical inspection.
      8.   Regardless of size, if the structure will have access to gas
service, it must have a building permit and pass a final building inspection.
      9.   Regardless of size, if the structure will have water service, it
will require a building permit and pass a final plumbing inspection.
      10.   Any addition to a detached structure will be required to meet the
requirements of the structure it becomes. (In other words, a carport
subsequently enclosed requires a building permit that meets with the
requirements of a garage. A garage subsequently equipped with electricity will
require an electrical permit and final inspection.)
   (C)   Requirements Particular To Carports:
      1.   Unattached metal, plastic, and canvas carports may not be outside of
the setback requirements for the main dwelling structure on the property as
required by zoning regulations. Additionally, such carports may only be placed
in a side or rear yard.
      2.   Attached wood frame carports are considered an addition onto the
dwelling or garage and require permits and inspections to ensure building code
compliance as do home additions.
   (D)   Penalties For Failure To Abide By The Permit Requirements Herein:
      1.   Failing to obtain a building permit prior to building or adding to
any structure that requires a permit will result in the permit fees being
double the scheduled fee.
      2.   Refusal to apply for and pay a permit fee after notice that one is
owed will result in daily fines from twenty five dollars ($25.00) to seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00).
      3.   Putting up a structure that does not meet with all building code and
zoning code requirements, including setback requirements will cause the
offender to obtain daily fines in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) to seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per day until the offending
structure is removed in its entirety. (Ord. 783, 5-27-2015)
4-1-3: EXISTING BUILDINGS:
Every new installation and every repair exceeding a total cost of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) including labor, said labor to be computed as not less than
the full cost of materials used, shall comply with the requirements of this
chapter.
A permit shall be required for all work on the exterior of any building. (The
cost of said permit is dependent upon the scope of work to be completed.)
No permit is required for the cosmetic remodeling of an interior of a
residential unit (repainting, putting in new fixtures, or new carpet or
flooring). Major remodeling, however (the moving of walls, removal of walls,
replumbing, adding plumbing or changes to electrical work), requires a permit.
Once again, the cost of the permit is dependent upon the scope of work. (Ord.
267E, 1-13-2016)
4-1-4: ALTERATIONS:
This chapter shall also apply to all alterations which affect the structural
strength or sanitary conditions of any building, but shall not include ordinary
repairs necessary for the maintenance of any building. (Ord. 267, 9-27-1961)

such building. The permit fee for the moving or demolishing of a structure
under this section shall be in accordance with the fees on file with the
building inspector. Property shall be left free and clear of all debris and all
excavations and shall be filled with the proper material approved by the
building inspector for the required project.

specifications covering the material or materials to be used, have been
submitted to, and approved by the building inspector and a permit has been
issued for the proposed construction or alteration. One set of the approved
plans and specifications shall be retained by the building inspector and one
set shall be kept at the building during construction. No changes shall be made
unless revised plans and specifications have been submitted to and approved in
writing by the building inspector. All public buildings shall meet all
specifications of the state fire marshal. (Ord. 267, 9-27-1961)
   (B)   Business And Public Buildings: All business and public buildings to be
built and all additions thereto, within the village, excepting one- and two-
family dwellings and public schools, shall comply with Illinois law and state
fire marshal regulations, including at least the minimum fire safety standards
for all occupancies of the applicable life safety code of the National Fire

family dwellings.

one and two family dwellings is hereby deleted.
      2.   Sprinkler Requirements. For all structures other than one and two
family dwellings and buildings where the only use is storage of non-combustible
materials (with no commercial operations or residential occupancy), the
automatic sprinkler requirements of the NFPA 101 Life Safety Code, 2018 Edition
shall apply to the same extent as with new construction in the following
circumstances: (1) where there is a change in ownership of such structure
(other than transfers from an individual(s) to a partnership, business entity

change of ownership of any commercial operation located in such structure, (3)

installation of automatic sprinklers is required hereunder shall complete such
installation within a period of twelve (12) months from the effective date of
the change in ownership (of the property or business occupying the property),
change in use or occupancy classification, or issuance of a building permit for
any Renovation, Modification, Reconstruction or Addition. The Village Building
Inspector, with the approval of the Village President, may grant extensions of
the foregoing time for compliance based upon special circumstances demonstrated
by the owner. The Building Inspector may approve variations from the
requirements of the NFPA 101 Life Safety Code, 2018 Edition where the design or
layout of the structure make strict compliance impossible or impractical,
provided that in no event shall the automatic sprinkler requirement be waived
or eliminated for any residential dwelling unit.

shall, upon conviction, subject the offender to a fine of not less than twenty
five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for

officers from time to time as the village board deems necessary. The process to
hire part time police officers is as follows:
      1.   The chief of police will bring the qualifications of all candidates
for the position to the police and fire committee of the village board; the
chief will make recommendation to the committee of the candidate the chief
feels is most qualified for the position.
      2.   The police and fire committee will review the candidates and the
chief's preferences and will make a decision on a candidate.
      3.   The committee chairman will bring the committee's recommendation for
hire to the board for approval.
   (B)   Duties: A part time police officer shall have all the responsibilities
of a full time police officer and such specific duties as delineated in the

part time officer may work within a calendar year is restricted. Part time
police officers shall not be assigned to supervise or direct full time police

   (D)   Policy Regarding Primary Employment: It is recognized that part time
officers will more than likely be engaged in a regular full time trade,
profession or occupation, commonly referred to as their primary employment. It
is the intent of the village not to hire or retain any part time officer whose
primary employment or occupation would conflict or be inconsistent with his/her
position on the Creve Coeur police department. The following are rules and

Creve Coeur police department, he shall note the same in the officer's
personnel file and direct the officer, in writing, to either make changes in
his primary employment, so as to eliminate the conflict, or to resign his part
time position.
      5.   Upon failure of the part time officer to make the necessary changes,
as stated above, the police committee of the village board, upon request from
the chief of police, will review the recommendation that the part time officer
be discharged. The chairman of the police committee shall then report the same
to the entire board and upon a simple majority vote of the village board, said
officer shall be discharged as a part time officer.
      6.   Part time officers shall not engage in any primary employment that
shall involve the sale, dispensing, or service of any manner of any alcoholic
liquor or beverages.
      7.   Part time officers shall not engage in any bail bond agencies,
private detective agencies, or any similar business that investigates the
private affairs of a citizen.
   (E)   Discipline: Part time officers shall be under the disciplinary
jurisdiction of the chief of police. Part time officers serve at the discretion
of the village of Creve Coeur authorities, shall not have any property rights
in said employment, and may be removed by the village of Creve Coeur
authorities at any time. Part time police officers shall comply with all
applicable rules and general orders issued by the police department.
   (F)   Other Policies With Respect To Part Time Officers:
      1.   Part time officers shall receive quarterly evaluations from their
supervisors and semiannual reviews by the chief of police to determine if any
abuses of departmental policy or official assignment have occurred.

hours per week in the village of Creve Coeur. Additionally, part time officers
may not work more than one thousand five hundred sixty (1,560) working hours

total number of hours for both departments count toward the one thousand five
hundred sixty (1,560) hour limit and must be reported to the state training
board.
      3.   Certified part time officers shall serve a three (3) month
probationary period, noncertified officers, if they are hired due to exigent
circumstances specifically approved by the village board, shall serve a six (6)
month probationary period.
      4.   Part time officers, whether certified or not, cannot be used in
place of or to supplant full time positions. It is further understood that
overtime shall be offered to full time officers first and if no one accepts the

knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he:
      1.   Sells, delivers, or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver
or provide any obscene writing, picture, record, or other representation or

of his body for gain; or

intent to disseminate it in violation of this section, or of the penal laws or
regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
      6.   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented or
held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (C)   “Obscene” Defined: Any material or performance is obscene if: (1) the
average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find
that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and (2) the
average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find
that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts
or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or
simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the
genitals; and (3) taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic,
political or scientific value.
   (D)   Interpretation Of Evidence: Obscenity shall be judged with reference
to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children
or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of
the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed
for or directed to such an audience.
Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination,
distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially
exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with
respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the
matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence shall be
admissible to show:
      1.   The character of the audience for which the material was designed or
to which it was directed;
      2.   What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary
adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have
on the behavior of such people;
      3.   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational, or other merits of
the material, or absence thereof;
      4.   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
state;
      5.   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or
other promotion of the material;
      6.   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (E)   Permissive Inference: An intent to disseminate may be inferred from
the creation, purchase, procurement, or possession of a mold, engraved plate or
other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple
copies, or the possession of more than three (3) copies of obscene material.
   (F)   Affirmative Defense: It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      1.   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under eighteen (18) years of age;
      2.   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.
   (G)   Severability Clause: If any section, subsection, subdivision
paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase in this section, or any part thereof, or
application thereof to any person, firm, corporation, public agency, or
circumstance, is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or
ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not
affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this section
or any part thereof. It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent of the
board of trustees that this section would have been adopted had such
unconstitutional or invalid provision, clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or
part thereof not then been included.

the dissemination:
   (A)   Was not for sale or gain and was made only to personal associates
other than children under eighteen (18) years of age;

for stolen or wanted information on the vehicle. When the Illinois state police
files are searched with negative results, the information contained in the

police. The information determined from these record searches will be used by
the police department in sending notification by certified mail to the owner or

disposition be made and setting forth public sale information. Exceptions to a
notification by certified mail to the registered owner or other legally
entitled person are set forth in subsection (F) of this section.

obtained from the registration records of this state, the sending of a second
certified notice will not be required.
      3.   When the identity of the registered owner or other person legally
entitled to the possession of an abandoned, lost or unclaimed vehicle of seven

purpose of determining the identity of the registered owner, lienholder, or
other legally entitled person and contacting the registered owner, lienholder,
or other legally entitled person by the U.S. mail, public service or in person
for a determination of disposition; and, an examination of the state police
stolen vehicles files for theft and wanted information. At the expiration of
the ten (10) day period, without the benefit of disposition information being

receiving domestic sewage. Such water may be conducted to a separate sump for
the purpose of pumping it to the surface of the ground or to a storm sewer if
such exists. (Ord. 304, 3-6-66)
In the event that only the floor drain in a building is involved at property
where the sanitary sewer was not constructed deep enough to serve the floor
drain, then the floor drain, alone, may be omitted from connection with the
public sanitary sewer, instead of complying with the requirements for sump
construction. In this case, adequate provision shall otherwise be made. (Ord.
334, 1-2-69)
7-1-32: FUNCTION OF HOUSE CONNECTIONS AND DRAINS:
The domestic sewage from residences, human habitations, institutions, stables,
garages, business buildings and industries shall be conveyed from said
structures in a conduit or pipe herein termed a "house sanitary connection".

   (C)   Where a connection or drain is laid at less distance than five feet
(5') from the exterior wall of any building, or in ground where it will be
subjected to vibration, or to settlement, cast-iron pipe shall be used. Where
the ground is of sufficient solidity for a proper foundation or where special
supports or secure foundations are provided, vitrified clay or cast-iron pipe
may be used.
7-1-35: LAYING:
No house sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet (3') of any
bearing wall which might be thereby weakened. The house sewer shall be laid at
a sufficient depth to protect it from frost.
All sewer and drain pipes shall be laid carefully in a trench in a straight
line and on a straight grade. Where deviation from a straight run is necessary,
it shall be made with a curve or other acceptable fitting.

   (A)   Every dwelling, along with all accessory structures located upon the
same lot or a contiguous lot, may be inspected systematically for compliance
with this chapter. Systematic inspections of dwellings may consist of both
exterior and interior inspections.
Exterior inspections may include the dwelling and any accessory structures, and
any environmental violations. Interior inspections, however, shall be limited

shall be applicable to the residential and common or public areas of such
building or premises. (Ord. 634A, 12-11-2013)
7-8-2: FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS:
   (A)   All dwellings subject to this chapter may be inspected at least once
every five (5) years. Written notice of the date of the inspection shall be
given to the owner and/or dwelling occupant at least five (5) days prior to the
date of the inspection. Said notice shall advise the owner and/or occupant of
the inspection, his/her right to refuse inspection of the dwelling unit, and
the village's right to seek issuance of an administrative search warrant in the
event of any such refusal. No inspection of an occupied dwelling shall occur
without the consent of the owner and/or occupant unless an administrative
search warrant is obtained. It shall be the responsibility of the owner and/or
occupant to be present at the dwelling unit on the date and time of inspection
to provide access for inspection.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall preclude the inspection of any premises
subject to this chapter more frequently than set forth in subsection (A) of
this section; provided, however, that any inspection more frequent than set
forth in subsection (A) of this section, shall be based upon a citizen
complaint or other indicia that are more probable than not that a housing
violation exists.
   (C)   A property owner desiring to notify the village that access is denied,
prior to a request for an inspection, may do so by advising the village in
writing that they wish to deny access to their property and require the village
to obtain an administrative search warrant. Said notice should be in writing
and should contain the following information: 1) owner name and address (agent
if applicable); and 2) property address and tax identification number. An
owner's denial of access shall not preclude a tenant from granting access. The
village will make every reasonable effort to recognize any other
constitutionally recognized method of refusing access to a building, but will
recognize denials for access when the above information is provided for each
property.
   (D)   The village is authorized to and may elect to obtain an administrative
warrant in the event that the property owner and/or occupant denies access to
or refuses inspection of the dwelling. A denial of access includes, but it is
not limited to, a written denial of access pursuant to Section
7-8-2(C), denial of entry at the scheduled date and time of inspection or re-
inspection, absence from the dwelling on the scheduled date and time of the
inspection or re-inspection, or any action or nonaction taken by the owner and/
or occupant that demonstrates an intent to refuse an inspection or re-
inspection. If the village elects to obtain an administrative warrant pursuant
to this Section
7-8-2(D), a five hundred-dollar ($500.00) fee will be assessed to the owner
and/or occupant who refuses inspection to cover the cost necessary to prepare,
obtain, and execute the administrative warrant. (Ord. 634A, 12-11-2013; Ord.

laws, the village shall provide written acknowledgment of same to the owner
and/or occupant upon request.
   (B)   If, upon completion of the inspection, the dwelling is found to have
one or more health or life threatening violations, or exterior housing code or
environmental violations, the village shall provide written notice of such
violations to the owner or designated agent who shall then have thirty (30)
days to correct said violation. If a dwelling is found to have one or more
health or life threatening violations, a fifty dollar ($50.00) charge will be
assessed for a reinspection fee to cover the cost of the reinspection to ensure
that the violations of the code found in the initial inspection are abated.
   (C)   If the dwelling passed inspection with no major health or life
threatening violations but minor violation(s) was/were noted, the minor
violation(s) must be remedied at the next scheduled inspection. In the event
that the minor violation(s) was/were not corrected, the building inspector
shall issue a citation under this section immediately. Each violation not
corrected shall be a separate offense and the fine shall be in the amount of
fifty dollars ($50.00) to seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per uncorrected
violation.
   (D)   If the village building inspector or his designee determines that any
applicable village code or ordinance has been violated after notice of such
violation(s) has been given and the time allowed to correct any such violation

warrant to verify that the violations have been removed. (Ord. 787, 8-12-2015)

thereof, or allow the same to be occupied by any person as a dwelling unless

with all provisions of the minimum housing regulations of this code.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person occupying any dwelling or
premises, or portion thereof, not to remove or cause to be removed therefrom,

waste, or to leave such building or premises in any condition detrimental or
dangerous to health.

boarding house, or dormitory shall cause or allow the same to be overcrowded or
so great a number of persons to dwell, remain or sleep in any such house, or
any portion thereof, as to cause any danger or detriment to health.
   (E)   The village building inspector or his designee is hereby authorized
and empowered to cause a sanitary inspection to be made of any and all
dwellings within the village at any reasonable hour.

the owner or person in control of the building or premises, or his agent, or
the occupant, directing such person to abate such nuisance and within forty
eight (48) hours to place such building or premises in a condition which shall
not endanger the public health.
   (G)   Upon failure of an owner or person in control to place any building or
premises in a sanitary condition within forty eight (48) hours of the notice
required by the preceding subsection, the village building inspector or his
designee shall proceed to abate such nuisance, and is authorized in addition
thereto, to post notice on the building or premises that such is unsafe for
habitation, and to enforce the provisions of this code including title 4,
chapter 5 of this code. Such inspector or designee shall keep an account of the

of four dollars ($4.00) per thousand gallons, being two dollars ($2.00) water
usage and two dollars ($2.00) sewer usage. Annually, the number of mobile homes
will be determined by the mobile home park and submitted to the Village for
confirmation, which number will then be used for the calculation of the monthly
Capital Improvement Fund fee and the base rate amount.
For residential users, a senior citizen discount for users over sixty two (62)
years old, after January 1, 2015, will apply and the water and sewer usage fees
will not apply to the first two thousand (2,000) gallons used.

or the owners of existing buildings who connect said structures, or restore the
service, to the water system of the village shall be required to have a village
approved water meter by January 1, 2015. The location of each meter shall be
approved by the public works department.
   (B)   There shall be a water meter service charge equal to the actual cost
of the meter and remote device. Alternatively, a meter payment program is
hereby established where a user, other than a rental property or business which
are not eligible for the program, may enroll to pay the actual cost of the
meter and remote device payable in equal monthly installments over the course
of thirty six (36) months as payment for the meter. Installation of meter shall
be the responsibility of the homeowner in accordance with specifications
supplied by the public works department. In those cases where payment of those
charges would work an undue hardship on the user, payment arrangements may be
made at the discretion of the public works department. After installation in
the system, the meter shall be inspected by a representative of the public
works department for approval. If installation does not meet specifications, a
fifteen dollar ($15.00) charge will be made for each additional trip to inspect
meter installation. When meter installation is approved, the meter and readout
device shall become the property of the village. Larger sized meters will be
charged according to costs of materials.
   (C)   Existing users of the village water which do not have meters at this
time may request that a water meter and remote readout device be installed on
their building as outlined in this section. Once a meter is installed, however,
it must remain in service thereafter. No later than January 1, 2015, every
existing user of the village water must have installed and in operation a water
meter as outlined in this section, and no “grandfathering” of lesser
requirements will exist. If the user has not purchased a water meter as of
January 1, 2015, they will automatically be enrolled in the meter payment
program at that time.
   (D)   Businesses, industrial and commercial users, schools, churches,
restaurants, hotels, motels, and nightclubs without usable water meters must
install meters acceptable to the public works department by November 30, 1994.
All village water users must have water meters purchased and installed by
January 1, 2015, or the user will be charged a twenty five dollar ($25.00)
monthly noncompliance fee until the meter is installed and the department has
inspected and approved the installation.
   (E)   Any owner or occupant of premises using the water service of the
village shall permit entrance and access to said premises by the public works
department for the purpose of inspection of the water meter, replacement, or
installation thereof upon said premises. If it is necessary to repair or
replace the meter due to normal use, wear and tear, the user shall reimburse
the village for the actual cost of repair or replacement less a credit for the
amount paid for the original meter installation. If it is necessary to repair
or replace the meter due to damage to the seal or meter from any tampering or
vandalism, the user shall pay all of the costs of a new meter, installation or

8-11-5: ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS:
   (A)   Village Review Of Permit Applications: Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Village Clerk
and sent to the Mayor and Board of Trustees for consultation with the engineer
hired by the Village as necessary within a reasonable time after filing. If the
application does not conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances,
codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Clerk shall, on advice and
direction from the Mayor and the Board, reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the Village Clerk in consultation with the
Mayor and Board of Trustees is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the
requirements of this chapter and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the Village Clerk shall issue a permit therefor as soon as
practicable.
   (B)   Additional Village Review Of Applications Of Telecommunications
Retailers:
      1.   Pursuant to section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village
that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior to
the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Village Clerk,
in consultation with the Mayor and Board of Trustees and the engineer hired by
the Village, if necessary, shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon
which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      2.   In the event that the Village Clerk fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either ten
(10) days after service of notice to the Village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter.
      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to section
8-11-4 of this chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (A) of this
section. (Ord. 814, 4-11-2018)
8-11-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   (A)   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on Village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the Village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations. (Ord. 814, 4-11-2018)
8-11-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with section
8-11-21 of this chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor. (Ord. 814, 4-11-2018)
8-11-8: INSURANCE:
   (A)   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
subsections (A)1 through (A)4 of this section:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      3.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
   (B)   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the Village within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
   (D)   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the Village of Creve Coeur of such intent to cancel
or not to renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no
event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection (A) of this section, or the requirements of
subsections (B), (C) and (D) of this section. A utility that elects to self-
insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements
required under subsection (A) of this section, such as evidence that the
utility is a "private self-insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. (Ord. 814, 4-11-
2018)
8-11-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 814, 4-11-2018)
8-11-10: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Mayor and the Board of Trustees after consultation
with an engineer employed by the Village if necessary. The dollar amount may
also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount
of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions
of this subsection (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 814, 4-11-
2018)

8-11-17: VEGETATION CONTROL:
   (A)   Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming shall not be considered a
normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
chapter.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (B)   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The Village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Village of the emergency, detail what steps have been taken for protection of
the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs.
If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement
of traffic, the Village police shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public.

the Mayor, the Board of Trustees, and, if necessary, an engineer employed by
the Village, shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision
of this chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The Village may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Village may require the utility requesting the
variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. 814, 4-11-2018)
8-11-22: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the Village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
Village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility who does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 814, 4-11-2018)
8-11-23: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 814, 4-11-2018)
8-11-24: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter
is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof. (Ord. 814, 4-11-2018)

9-2-4: TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNALS LEGEND:
Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the words
"Go", "Caution", or "Stop" or exhibiting different colored lights successively,
the following colors only shall be used and said terms and lights shall
indicate as follows:
   (A)   Circular Green or the Word "Go":
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or
turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. But
vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      2.   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed otherwise by a pedestrian
signal.
   (B)   Steady Yellow or the Word "Caution":
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter or the related green
movement is being terminated, and shall stop before entering the nearest
crosswalk at the intersection, but if such stop cannot be made in safety, a
vehicle may be driven cautiously through the intersection.
      2.   Unless otherwise directed by pedestrian signal, pedestrians facing
such signal are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway, and no pedestrian shall cross except upon a green light or go sign.
   (C)   Steady Red or the Word "Stop":
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at such other point as may be indicated
by a clearly visible line; if there is no such line then vehicles shall stop
before entering such crosswalk and shall remain standing until the green
indication is shown, unless otherwise directed by a sign or arrow.
      2.   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway, shall
cross until receiving a green light or go sign or unless and until a separate
"Walk" indication is shown.
   (D)   Green Straight Through Arrow (Alone):
      1.   Vehicular traffic facing right or left: Such signal may proceed
straight through, but shall not turn right or left. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection at the time such signal is exhibited.

the appropriately marked or unmarked crosswalk unless directed otherwise by a
pedestrian signal.
   (E)   Green Turn Arrow (Alone or With Circular Green, With Steady Yellow,
With Steady Red, or With Green Straight Through Arrow):
Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall comply with the meaning of the
circular green, steady yellow or straight through arrow indication as if it
were shown alone, except that such vehicular traffic may cautiously enter the
intersection to make the movement indicated by the green turn arrow. Vehicular
traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
   (F)   In the event that an official traffic control signal or flashing red
signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the
provision of this Section and of Section
9-2-5 shall be applicable except as to provision which by their nature can have
no application. Any stop required shall be at a sign or marking on the pavement
indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any sign or
marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (G)   The motorman of any street car shall obey the above signals applicable
to vehicles.
   (H)   Green Arrow Alone:
Vehicular traffic facing the signal may enter the intersection only to make the
movement or movements indicated by the arrows, but shall not interfere with
other traffic or endanger pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk.
   (I)   In the event an official traffic control signal or flashing red signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provision
of this Section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their
nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

shall have the following meaning:
   (A)   Opaque arrows on green, green arrow on opaque background, or green

over which the signal is displayed providing that no intersection traffic
control signal gives a stop indication affecting the lane or lanes involved.
   (B)   Opaque "x" on red, red "x" on opaque background, or red alone: Drivers
of vehicles facing such signals are prohibited from using the lane over which
the signal is displayed.
9-2-7: PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS:

the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the driver
of all vehicles.
   (B)   Don't Walk: While the "don't walk" signal is illuminated, either
steady or flashing, no pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the

9-11-3: PROBABLE CAUSE AND NOTICE:
Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is

of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and who is physically
present at the scene of the alleged violation that the vehicle will be towed
and impounded. The officer shall inform any present owner and/or person in
control of the vehicle of that person's right to request a hearing to be
conducted under section
9-11-4 of this chapter. An owner may secure release of an impounded vehicle
pending completion of the hearings provided for in section
9-11-4 of this chapter by posting a bond of cash, money order, certified check,
or approved credit card payment service with the Police Department in the
amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and accrued towing and storage

9-11-4: HEARING:
Within forty eight (48) hours after a vehicle is towed/impounded pursuant to

by certified mail, return receipt requested at the address of the owner as it
appears in the records of the Secretary of State, of his or her right to
request a hearing before a Hearing Officer to determine whether the subject
vehicle is eligible for impoundment pursuant to this section. The notice shall
state the penalties that may be imposed if no hearing is requested, including
that a vehicle that is not released by payment of the penalty and fees may be
sold or disposed of by the Village in accordance with applicable law. The owner
of record seeking a hearing must file a written request for a hearing with the
Village no later than fifteen (15) days after the notice was mailed.
Upon receiving a written request for a hearing, the Chief of Police shall
review the file and determine whether the facts of the situation are such that
the Village should dismiss the impoundment charge. If the Chief of Police
determines not to dismiss the impoundment charge upon his or her review, the
hearing shall be conducted by the Hearing Officer appointed by the Mayor under
authority of this Code.
The hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the
Hearing Officer, no later than forty five (45) days after the request for a
hearing has been filed. No less than ten (10) days prior to the hearing, the
Hearing Officer will notify the owner of record, by mail, of the date, time and
location of the hearing. All interested persons shall be given an opportunity

Hearing Officer may, at the request of the Village or the owner, direct
witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of
evidence will not apply during the hearing, but hearsay evidence shall be
admissible only if it is of the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent
persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after considering evidence
received during the hearing, the Hearing Officer determines by a preponderance
of the evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with the commission of
an offense set forth in section
9-11-1 of this chapter, the Hearing Officer shall enter an order finding the
owner of the vehicle civilly liable to the Village of an administrative and
processing fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00). If bond has been posted in
accordance with section
 9-11-6 of this chapter, all sums due the Village and the tow operator for
towing and impoundment fees shall be distributed to the Village and tow
operator, as the case may be. If the Hearing Officer enters an order finding
the owner of record liable to the Village for the administrative fee, any
vehicle still impounded shall continue to be impounded until the owner pays the
administrative fee to the Village plus all applicable towing and storage
charges to the tow operator.
If the Hearing Officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
vehicle was not used in connection with the commission of an offense set forth
in section
9-11-1 of this chapter, the Hearing Officer shall order the immediate return of
the owner's vehicle and of any cash bond and may order a return of towing and
impoundment fees (if said fees were paid in advance of the hearing).
If the owner of record fails to timely request a hearing the Hearing Officer
shall enter a default order in favor of the Village. (Ord. 682A, 1-9-2019)
9-11-5: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW:
A final order entered by a Hearing Officer under section
9-11-4 of this chapter is subject to review under the Administrative Review Act
found at 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq. (Ord. 682A, 1-9-2019)
9-11-6: ADMINISTRATIVE FEE; DISPOSAL OF VEHICLES:
The administrative fee as imposed pursuant to this chapter shall constitute a
debt due and owing the Village. The debt may be satisfied by the bond posted
pursuant to this chapter or where no bond is posted, by cash, money order,
certified check or approved credit card payment service. If the administrative
penalty and applicable towing and impoundment fees are not paid within thirty
(30) days after the expiration of time for administrative review of the Hearing
Officer's determination or within thirty (30) days after an action seeking
administrative review has been resolved and in favor of the Village, whichever
is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of
in the manner provided for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the
Illinois Vehicle Code. (Ord. 682A, 1-9-2019)
9-11-7: VEHICLE POSSESSION:
Except as otherwise provided by law, no owner, lien holder or other person
shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this
chapter until the bond and towing and impoundment fees are paid or the
administrative penalty and fees applicable under this chapter have been paid.
Whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has
commenced proceedings to repossess the vehicle, possession of the vehicle shall
be given to that person if she or he agrees in writing to pay to the Village
from proceeds of the sale of the vehicle the administrative fee, plus
applicable towing and storage charges. (Ord. 682A, 1-9-2019)

general public.
   SPECIAL USES: This zoning title is based upon the division of the village
into districts within which districts the use of land and buildings and the
location of structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is
recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique
characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district
without consideration in each case, of the effect such uses will have on
neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at a particular
location. Such special uses fall into two (2) general categories:
   (A)   Uses either municipally operated, or operated by publicly regulating
utilities or uses traditionally affected with a public interest.
   (B)   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that
their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their effect
upon neighboring properties or public facilities.
   STABLE: A building accommodating one or more horses.
   STORY: That part of a building (except a "mezzanine" as defined herein)
included between the surface of one floor and the surface of the next floor, or
if there is no floor above, then the ceiling when more than fifty percent (50%)
by cubic content is below the height level of the adjoining ground.
   STORY, HALF: An uppermost story lying under a sloping roof, the floor area
of which, at a height of four feet (4') above the floor, does not exceed one-
half (1/2) of the floor area in the story directly below, and the height above
at least two hundred (200) square feet of floor space is seven feet six inches
(7'6").
   STREET: All property dedicated or intended for public or private street,
highway, freeway or roadway purposes or subject to easements therefor.
   STREET LINE: A dividing line between a lot, tract or parcel of land and a
contiguous street.
   STRUCTURAL ALTERATION: Any change in the supporting members of a building,
such as bearing walls or partitions, columns, beams or girders, or any
substantial change in the roof or in the exterior walls.
   STRUCTURE: Anything constructed or erected, that use of which requires
permanent location on the ground or attached to something having a permanent
location on the ground, including, but without limiting, the generality of the
foregoing, advertising signs, billboard backstops for tennis courts and
pergolas.
   TEMPORARY BUILDING OR USE: A structure or use permitted by the board of
appeals to exist during periods of construction of the main building or use, or
for special events.
   USE: The purpose for which land or a building is designed, arranged or
intended to be used, or for which land or building is or may be occupied.
   USE, MAIN: The principal use to which the premises are devoted and the
principal purpose for which the premises exist.
   VEHICLE: Every device in, upon, or by which any person or property is or may
be transported.
   VEHICLE SALES AND RENTAL: The sale, rental, or display of vehicles, boats,
trailers, recreational vehicles, mobile homes, or farm equipment, not including
salvage operations or scrap operations.
   WALL (FENCE): An obscuring structure of definite height and location to
serve as an obscuring screen in carrying out the requirements of this title.
   YARD: An open space on the same lot with a building, unoccupied and
unobstructed by any portion of a structure from the ground upward, except as
otherwise provided herein. In measuring a yard for the purpose of determining
the width of a side yard, or the depth of a rear yard, the mean horizontal
distance between the lot line and main building shall be used.
   YARD, FRONT: A yard extending across the front of a lot between the side lot
lines, and being the minimum horizontal distance between the street line and
the main building or any projection thereto other than the projection of the
usual steps.
   YARD, REAR: A yard extending across the rear of a lot, measured between the
side lot lines, and being the minimum horizontal distance between the rear lot
line and rear of the main building or any projections other than steps. On
corner lots, the rear yard shall be considered as parallel to the street upon
which the lot has its least dimension. On both corner lots and interior, the
rear yard shall in all cases be at the opposite end of the lot from the front
yard.
   YARD, SIDE: A yard between the main building and the side line of the lot
and extending from the front yard line to the rear yard line.
   ZONING EXCEPTIONS AND VARIANCES:
      Exception: A use permitted only after review of an application by the
zoning board or the village board; such review being necessary because the
provisions of this title covering conditions, precedent or subsequent, are not
precise enough to all applications without interpretation, and such review is
required by this title.
      Variance: A modification of the literal provisions of this zoning title
granted when strict enforcement of this zoning title would cause undue hardship
owing to circumstances unique in the individual property on which the variance
is granted.
The crucial points of variance are: undue hardship and unique circumstances
applying to the property. A variance is not a justification unless these
elements are present in the case.
The "exception" differs from the "variance" in several respects. An exception
does not require "undue hardship" in order to be allowable. The exceptions that
are found in this title appear as "special uses" on review by the village board
or zoning board. These land uses could not be conveniently allocated to one
zone or another, or the effects of such uses could not be definitely foreseen
as of a given time. The general characteristics of these uses include one or
more of the following:
   (A)   They require large areas.
   (B)   They are infrequent.
   (C)   They sometimes create an unusual amount of traffic. (Ord. 482, 4-7-
1982; amd. Ord. 550-C, 5-10-1995; Ord. 482-T, 2-26-1997; Ord. 482X, 7-9-1997;

   (A)   Protect human life and health.
   (B)   Minimize public and private property damage.
   (C)   Protect individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
   (D)   Minimize surface and ground-water.
   (E)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in combination
with similar developments, create an unjustified demand for public investment
in flood-control works by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including
public facilities which serve such uses, shall be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction.
   (F)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in combination
with similar development, cause flood losses if public streets, sewer, water
and other utilities must be extended below the flood level to serve the
development.
   (G)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in combination
with similar development, create an additional burden to the public to pay the
costs of rescue, relief, emergency preparedness measures, sandbagging, pumping
and temporary dikes or levees.
   (H)   Control development which will, when acting alone or in combination
with similar development, create an additional burden to the public for
business interruptions, factory closings, disruption of transportation routes,
interference with utility services, and other factors that will result in loss
of wages, sales, production and tax write-offs.
   (I)   Provide for public awareness of the flooding potential.
   (J)   Help maintain a stable tax base by the preservation or enhancement of
property values for future flood-plain development. In addition, development of
future flood-blight areas on flood plains will be minimized and property values
and the tax base adjacent to the flood plain will be preserved.
10-3A-2: PRINCIPAL USES PERMITTED:
In a C Conservation District no building or land shall be used and no building
shall be erected except for one or more of the following specified uses, unless
otherwise provided in this Ordinance, provided that no filling, diking,

   (A)   All uses:
No structure (temporary or permanent), fill (including fill for roads and
levees) deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment, or other use
may be allowed as a special-exception use which, acting alone or in combination
with existing or future uses, unduly affects the capacity of the floodway or
unduly increases flood heights. Consideration of the effects of a proposed use
shall be based on a reasonable assumption that there will be an equal degree of
encroachment extending for a significant reach on both sides of the river.
   (B)   Fill:
      1.   Any fill proposed to be deposited must be shown to have some
beneficial purpose and the amount thereof not greater than is necessary to
achieve that purpose, as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the owner showing
the uses to which the filled land will be put and the final dimensions of the
proposed fill or other materials.
      2.   Such fill or other materials shall be protected against erosion by
riprap, vegetation cover, or bulkheading.

placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow
of flood water.
         (a)   Whenever possible, structure shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and
         (b)   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately
on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
      4.   Structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may
result in damage to other structures, restriction of bridge openings and other
narrow sections of the river; and
      5.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be
constructed at or above the regulatory flood-protection elevation for the
particular area, or floodproofed.
   (D)   Storage of Material and Equipment:
      1.   The storage and processing of materials, that are in time of
flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal
or plant life is prohibited.
      2.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject
to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warnings.

proposed type of home occupation. Thereupon the zoning board shall investigate
or cause to be investigated the circumstances and attitudes of the neighborhood
prior to granting approval of or the rejection of the application.
The application and/or registration for permission to conduct such business
shall be accompanied by a fee which shall be established annually by the

giving the owner and any interested persons who applied for the use at least
ten (10) days' written notice of the grounds for revocation and the opportunity
for an appeal before the zoning board of appeals at which time they may present
evidence bearing upon the question and cross examination of witnesses. The
grounds for which a permit may be revoked are:
         (a)   The owner or interested person applying for the use has
knowingly furnished false or misleading information or withheld relevant
information on any application for any use or knowingly suffered or caused
another to furnish or withhold such information on his or her behalf;
         (b)   The owner, his/her agent, employee, officer, tenant, licensee or
occupant has violated any of the provisions of the zoning ordinance or the

that the building inspector shall give at least seven (7) days' prior written
notice to the owner of the alleged violation or manner in which the property no
longer complies with the standards with the opportunity to correct the problem
during said time.
Appeals from any decision of the building inspector concerning the granting or
revocation of a use with administrative approval shall be to the zoning board
of appeals. Filing of an appeal from the decision of the building inspector to
revoke a permit will stay his/her decision pending the decision of the zoning
board of appeals.
      8.   The home occupation permit shall expire when:

or use thereof which would make the variation necessary for the full enjoyment
of the lot by the owners or occupiers.

CHAPTER 12
GENERAL REGULATIONS
SECTION:
10-12-1: Subdivision Open Space Plan
10-12-2: Average Lot Sizes
10-12-3: Schedule of Regulations
10-12-1: SUBDIVISION OPEN SPACE PLAN:
The intent of this Chapter is to permit one family residential subdivisions to
be planned as a comprehensive unit allowing, therefore, certain modifications
to the standards as outlined in the "Schedule of Regulations" to be made in R-
1, R-2, and R-3 One Family Residential Districts when the following conditions
are met:
   (A)   The lot area in all R-1, R-2, and R-3 One Family Residential Districts
may be reduced to the size of the smallest lot size allowed as indicated in
Section 10-12-3 herein, provided that the population density shall be no
greater than if the land area to be subdivided were developed in the minimum
average square foot lot areas as required under R-1, R-2, and R-3. All
calculations shall be predicated upon the One Family Districts having the
following number of dwelling units per acre:
      R-1 - 2.2 dwelling units per acre
      R-2 - 3.9 dwelling units per acre
      R-3 - 4.5 dwelling units per acre
   (B)   Lot widths may be reduced to not less than eighty five feet (85') in
an R-1 District and sixty feet (60') in an R-2 District. The required least
side yard indicated in Section 10-12-3 shall be provided for each lot. The
total of two (2) side yards indicated in Section 10-12-3 may be reduced by ten
percent (10%).
   (C)   For each foot of land gained, under the provisions of subsection (A)
above of this Section, within a residential subdivision, through the reduction
of lot size below the minimum requirements as outlined in the "Schedule of
Regulations", equal amounts of land shall be dedicated to common use of the lot
owners in the subdivision in a manner approved by the Village.
   (D)   The area to be dedicated for the common use of the subdivision shall
in no instance be less than two (2) acres and shall be in a location and shape
approved by the Village.
   (E)   Access shall be provided to areas dedicated for the common use of the
subdivision for those lots not bordering on such dedicated areas by means of
streets or pedestrian access-ways.
   (F)   In approving the application of the "Subdivision Open Space Plan"
technique, the Zoning Board shall be cognizant of the following objectives:
      1.   To provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the
natural character of open fields, stands of trees, brooks, lakes, hills, and
similar natural assets;
      2.   To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the
development of residential areas;
      3.   To encourage a more efficient and desirable use of open area while
recognizing a reduction in development costs, and by allowing the developer to
by-pass natural obstacles in the site;
      4.   To encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance
to all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the
development of recreational facilities.
   (G)   This plan for reduced lot sizes shall only be permitted if it is
mutually agreeable to the Village Board and the subdivider or developer.
   (H)   Under this planned unit approach, the developer or subdivider shall
dedicate the total park area (see subsection (B) of this Section) at the time
of filing of the final plat on all or any portion of the plat.
10-12-2: AVERAGE LOT SIZES:
The intent of this Section is to permit the subdivider or developer to vary his
lot sizes and lot widths so as to average the minimum size of lot per unit as
required in Section 12-12-3, Schedule of Regulations, for each One Family
Residential District. If this option is selected, the following conditions
shall be met:
   (A)   In meeting the average minimum lot size the subdivision shall be so
designed as not to create lots of widths of less than eighty five feet (85') in
an R-1 District, sixty feet (60') in an R-2 District.
   (B)   All computations showing lot area and the average area resulting
through this technique shall be indicated on the print of the preliminary plat.
   (C)   The combining of the features of Sections
10-12-1 and
10-12-2 may be carried out. The Zoning Board shall determine, in their review
of the preliminary plat that the full intent of Sections
10-12-1 and
10-12-2 has been met.

Notes -Schedule of Regulations
         (a)   See Section
10-12-1, "Subdivision Open Space Plan" and Section
10-12-2, "Average Lot Sizes" regarding exceptions as to lot area, and the
related density controls.
         (b)   The side yard abutting upon a street shall not be less than
eight feet (8') when there is a common rear yard. In case of a rear yard
abutting a side yard of an adjacent lot, the side abutting a street shall not
be less than the required front yard of that district.
         (c)   The height of any main building or accessory building may exceed
the maximum permitted height by one foot (1') for each additional one foot (1')
by which the width of each yard exceeds the minimum yard requirement.
         (d)   The total number of rooms in a multiple dwelling structure of
two (2) stories or less shall not be more than the area of the parcel, in
square feet divided by nine hundred (900). The total number of rooms in a
multiple dwelling of over two (2) stories shall not be more than the area of
the parcel, in square feet, divided by five hundred forty (540). For the
purpose of computing rooms, the following shall control:
 
Efficiency Apartment Unit 1 room
One-Bedroom Unit          2 rooms
Two-Bedroom Unit          3 rooms
Three-Bedroom Unit        4 rooms
 
         (e)   In RM-2 Districts the minimum front and rear yards shall be
equal to the height of the building, except that where a front lot line abuts a
street, one-half (1/2) the width of the right of way of said street may be
considered as a front yard setback, but in no instance shall any front or rear
yard setback be less than twenty five feet (25'). In all RM-1 and RM-
2 Multiple-Residence Districts, the minimum distance between any two (2)
buildings shall be regulated according to the length and height of such
buildings. The formula regulating the required minimum distance between two (2)
buildings is as follows:
 
S = LA + LB + 2 (HA + HB )
6
Where:  
 S  = Required minimum horizontal distance between any wall of building A and
       any wall of building B or the vertical prolongation of either.
 LA = Total length of building A.
       The total length of building A is the length of that portion or portions
    of a wall or walls of building A from which, when viewed directly from
       above, lines drawn perpendicular to building A will intersect any wall
       of building B.
 LB = Total length of building B.
       The total length of building B is the length of that portion or portions
    of a wall or walls of building B from which, when viewed directly from
       above, lines drawn perpendicular to building B will intersect any wall
       of building A.
 HA = Height of building A.
       The height of building A at any given level is the height above natural
       grade level of any portion or portions of a wall or walls along the
    length of building A. Natural grade levels shall be the mean level of
       the ground immediately adjoining the portion or portions of a wall or
       walls along the total length of the building.
 HB = Height of building B.
       The height of building B at any given level is the height above natural
       grade level of any portion or portions of a wall or walls along the
    length of building B. Natural grade levels shall be the mean level of
       the ground immediately adjoining the portion or portions of a wall or
       walls along the total length of the building.
 
         (f)   Any side or rear yard for a principal use or a special use
permitted in this district other than one-family, two- (2) family and multiple-
family dwellings shall not be less than the height of the structure at the side
or rear lot line.
         (g)   For each story in excess of two (2) stories, a side yard of two
and one-half feet (21/2') for each additional story shall be provided, in
addition to the minimum ten foot (10') requirement. The distance between
buildings on the same lot shall be regulated by the building distance formula
specified in subsection (e) of this Section.
         (h)   In a block on one side of a street thirty percent (30%) or more
occupied, the depth of the front yard shall not be less than, and need not be
more than, the average depth of front yards of existing buildings.
         (i)   No side yards are required along the interior side lot lines,
except as otherwise specified in the Building Code. On the exterior side yard
which borders on a Residential District, there shall be provided a setback of
not less than ten feet (10') on the side or residential street. If walls or
structures facing interior lot lines contain windows or other openings, side
yards of not less than ten feet (10') shall be provided. Parking shall be
permitted in the front yard after approval of the parking plan layout and
points of access by the Zoning Board. The setback shall be measured from the
nearest side of the existing and/or proposed right of way lines, whichever is
greater. (Ord. 482, 4-7-1982)
         (j)   (Rep. by Ord. 482Y, 8-13-1997)
         (k)   One-half (1/2) the width of alleys at the rear of the lot may be
considered in computing rear yard setbacks.
         (m)   Parking shall not be permitted in a required front yard.
         (n)   A six foot (6') obscuring wall or fence and a twenty foot (20')
wide greenbelt or a six foot (6') chain link fence and a heavily planted forty
foot (40') wide greenbelt shall be provided on those sides of the property
abutting land zoned for residential use; the planting plan shall be reviewed
and approved by the Building Inspector in conformity with Section
10-14-9 of this Title.
         (o)   Planned developments involving two (2) acres or more shall be
subject to the approval of the Village Board after having received the review
and recommendation of the Zoning Board regarding modification to height and
bulk restrictions of this Chapter; it being the intent hereof to allow for
greater height where adequate site relationship to abutting zones or uses can
be maintained. (Ord. 482, 4-7-1982)
CHAPTER 13

farm buildings, church spires, flag poles, public monuments or wireless
transmission towers; nor to chimneys not more than three hundred fifty feet
(350') in height; provided, however, that the Zoning Board may specify a height
limit for any such structure when such structure requires authorization as a
special use; or the Board may grant a variance to permit a higher chimney upon
a finding of fact that such greater height is in the public interest.
   (D)   Lots Adjoining Alleys: In calculating the area of a lot that adjoins a
dedicated alley or lane, for the purpose of applying lot area requirements of
this Title, one-half (1/2) the width of such alley abutting the lot shall be
considered as part of such lot.
   (E)   Yard Regulations: When yard regulations cannot reasonably be complied
with, as in the case of a planned development in the Multiple Family District,
or where their application cannot be determined on lots existing and of record
at the time this Title became effective, and on lots of peculiar shape,
topography, or due to architectural or site arrangement, such regulations may
be modified or determined by the Zoning Board.

regulations, restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by the
provisions of any other law or ordinance, then the provisions of this title
shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other law or ordinance impose more
stringent requirements than are imposed or required by this title, then the
provisions of such law or ordinance shall govern. (Ord. 482, 4-7-1982)
10-14-2: SCOPE:
No building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be erected,
constructed or altered, and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of
any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except in conformity with the
provisions of this title. (Ord. 482, 4-7-1982)
10-14-3: NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, STRUCTURES:
   (A)   Intent: Within the districts established by this title or amendments
that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this title was passed or amended, but which
would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this title or
future amendment.
It is the intent of this title to permit these nonconformities to continue
until they are removed. Such uses are declared by this title to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this
title that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended,
nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere
in the same district.
A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a
nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged
after passage of this title by attachment on a building or premises of
additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition
of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district
involved.
To avoid undue hardships, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a
change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this title and upon which actual building construction has been
diligently carried on. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the
placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a
permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing
building has been substantially begun preparatory to actual construction
provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the
building involved.
   (B)   Nonconforming Lots: In any district in which single-family dwellings
are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
title, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this title. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails
to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally
applicable in the district; provided that yard dimension and other requirements
not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance to yard
requirements shall be obtained through approval of the zoning board.
   (C)   Nonconforming Uses Of Land: Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this title, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer
permissible under the terms of this title as enacted or amended, such use may
be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
      1.   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date or amendment of this title.
      2.   No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date
of adoption or amendment of this title.
      3.   If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period
of more than one hundred eighty (180) days, any subsequent use of such land
shall conform to the regulations specified by this title for the district in
which such land is located.
   (D)   Nonconforming Structures: Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this title that could not be built
under the terms of this title by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the
lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
      1.   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity;
      2.   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
title;
      3.   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
   (E)   Nonconforming Uses Of Structures And Land: If a lawful use of a
structure, or of structure and land in combination, exists at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this title, that would not be allowed in the
district under the terms of this title, the lawful use may be continued so long
as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      1.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this title
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, or moved, except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
      2.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use, and which
existed at the time of adoption or amendment of this title, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
      3.   If no structural alterations are made, and nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming
use provided that the zoning board, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming
use. In permitting such change, the zoning board may require appropriate
conditions and safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this title;
      4.   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the
nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
      5.   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for six (6) consecutive
months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period, the
structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be
used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses shall be excepted from this
provision;
      6.   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises
in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (F)   Repairs And Maintenance: On any building devoted in whole or in part
to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12)
consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding fifty
percent (50%) of the assessed value of the building, provided that the cubic
content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of
this title shall not be increased.
Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring
to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by
any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such
official.
   (G)   Uses Under Exception Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses: Any use for
which a general exception or special approval is permitted as provided in this
title shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further action
be deemed a conforming use in such district.
   (H)   Change Of Tenancy Or Ownership: There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land, structures
and premises provided there is no change in the nature or character of such
nonconforming uses except in conformity with the provisions of this title.
(Ord. 482, 4-7-1982)
10-14-4: ACCESSORY BUILDINGS:
Accessory buildings, except as otherwise permitted in this title shall be
subject to the following regulations:
   (A)   Where the accessory building is structurally attached to a main
building, it shall be subject to, and must conform to, all yard regulations of
this title, applicable to main buildings.
   (B)   Accessory buildings shall not be erected in any required yard, except
a rear yard. (Ord. 482, 4-7-1982)
   (C)   An accessory building may not occupy more than twenty five percent
(25%) of a required rear yard, plus twenty percent (20%) of any nonrequired
rear yard, nor exceed twenty four feet by thirty feet (24' x 30'), whichever is
the lesser. An accessory building or garage may be built on a vacant lot that
has no dwelling only with the approval of the zoning board, which zoning board
shall take into consideration the character of the neighborhood and the impact
upon said neighborhood from the proposed accessory building or garage to be
erected upon the vacant lot. (Ord. 482D, 1988)
   (D)   No detached accessory building shall be located closer than ten feet
(10') to any main building nor shall it be located closer than five feet (5')
to any side or rear lot line. In no instance shall an accessory structure be
located within a dedicated easement right of way. (Ord. 482-N, 12-13-1995)
   (E)   No detached accessory building in an R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-T, RM-1,
RM-2, O-1 or B-1 district shall exceed one story or fifteen feet (15') in
height. Accessory buildings in all other districts may be constructed to equal
the permitted maximum height of structures in said districts, subject to zoning
board review and approval.
   (F)   When an accessory building is located on a corner lot, the side lot
line of which is substantially a continuation of the front lot line of the lot
to its rear, said building shall not project beyond the front yard line
required on the lot in rear of such corner lot. When an accessory building is
located on a corner lot, the side lot line of which is substantially a
continuation of the side lot line of the lot to its rear, said building shall
not project beyond the side yard line of the lot in the rear of such corner
lot. (Ord. 482, 4-7-1982)

10-14-5-2: OFF STREET PARKING:
   (A)   General Requirements:
      1.   Location Of Parking Spaces: All parking spaces shall be located on
the same zoning lot as the building or use served, except that parking spaces
to serve business, commercial, industrial, and office buildings or uses may be
located within three hundred feet (300') of the use if the spaces are located
in a business, commercial or industrial or office district.
Residential off street parking spaces shall consist of a paved parking strip,
driveway, garage or combination thereof and shall be located on the premises
they are intended to serve and shall be subject to requirements of section
10-14-4, "Accessory Buildings", of this chapter.
      2.   Control Of Off Street Parking Facilities: In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served is located, the facilities shall be in the same
possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory.
Private possession may be either by deed or long term lease, the term of the
lease to be approved by the zoning board; and the deed or lease shall be filed
with the zoning board. The deed or lease shall require the owner to maintain
the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served or
the deed or lease, whichever ends first.
      3.   Handicapped/Accessible Parking: Any required parking area shall
provide parking spaces designated and located to adequately accommodate the
disabled, and these shall be clearly marked as such. The markings shall include
yellow striping on the pavement designated as the accessible parking space and
shall provide a clearly posted sign as provided by section 11-301 of the
Illinois vehicle code. The sign shall clearly announce the fine for illegal
parking in the accessible space. Accessible parking spaces shall be the parking
spaces located closest to nearest accessible entryway to the facility. One
handicapped/accessible space shall be required for the first twenty five (25)
(or less) parking spaces required on a site. When more than twenty five (25)
spaces the number of required handicapped/accessible parking spaces shall be
provided as indicated in the schedule of handicapped/accessible parking
requirements at subsection (C) of this section. The schedule of handicapped/
accessible parking spaces applies to all zoning districts.
      4.   Access: All off street parking facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley in a manner which
will least interfere with traffic movement.
      5.   Collective Parking For Separate Uses:
         (a)   Off street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided
collectively if the total number of spaces is not less than the sum of the
separate requirements of each use and all regulations governing the location of
parking spaces in relation to the use served are adhered to. Further, no
parking space or portion thereof shall be counted as a required space for more
than one use unless authorized by the zoning board.
         (b)   The zoning board may authorize a reduction in the total number
of required parking spaces for two (2) or more nonresidential uses jointly
providing off street parking when their respective hours of operation do not
overlap. (See schedule for shared parking listed in subsection (C) of this
section.) The approval of joint use parking shall be subject to the following
conditions:
            (1)   Building Or Use: No more than fifty percent (50%) of the
parking spaces required for a building or use may be supplied by parking
facilities required for any other building or use.
            (2)   Distinguishable Land Uses: The number of shared spaces for
two (2) or more distinguishable land uses shall be determined by the following
procedure:
   A. Multiply the minimum parking required for each individual use, as set
forth in the schedule of required parking, by the appropriate percentage
indicated in the shared parking percentages schedule, for each of the six (6)
designated time periods.
   B. Add the resulting sums for each of the six (6) columns.
   C. The minimum parking requirement shall be the highest sum among the six
(6) columns.
            (3)   Conformance; Conflict: If one, or all of the land uses
proposing to make use of joint parking facilities do not conform to one of the
general land use classifications in the shared parking percentages schedule as
determined by the zoning board, then the petitioner shall submit sufficient
data to indicate that there is not substantial conflict in the principal
operating hours of the uses.
            (4)   Legal Agreement: The property owners involved in the joint
use of off street parking facilities shall submit a legal agreement approved by
the village attorney guaranteeing that the parking spaces shall be maintained
so long as the use of the property is in existence or unless the required
parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this section
10-14-5. The instrument shall be recorded by the property owner with the
recorder of deeds, and a copy filed with the zoning board.
            (5)   Fractional Parking Spaces: When the calculation of the number
of off street parking spaces results in fractional space, any fraction of less
than one-half (1/2) may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-half (1/2) or
more, shall be counted as one parking space. Parking spaces required on an
employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or
present on the premises at any one time.
            (6)   Use Of Required Parking Spaces: Except as provided in special
use, required parking spaces are solely for the parking of passenger vehicles
of patrons, occupants, or employees for the legal use. The storage of
merchandise, materials, inoperable motor vehicles, recreational vehicles and
boats, motor vehicles for sale, trucks, trailers, or equipment is not
permitted.
               A. Obscuring Fences Or Shrubs: Where the parking area is
contiguous to a residential district, the line or lines of contiguity of the
property shall be provided with a continuous and completed obscuring wood or
masonry wall, fence, or shrubbery six feet (6') in height, measured from the
surface of the parking area. Each entrance and exit from a parking lot shall be
at least twenty feet (20') from any adjacent property located in a residential
district.
               B. Landscaping And Screening: Landscaping and screening shall be
provided in accordance with the requirements of the zoning code.
               C. Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off street parking
areas shall be down-lit away from residential properties and public streets in
such a way as not to create a nuisance. However, in no case shall the lighting
exceed three (3) foot-candles measured at the lot line, nor shall the lighting
be installed at a height exceeding twenty feet (20'). Lighting for off street
parking shall be arranged to reflect the light away from all adjoining
residential buildings, and residential streets and property.
   (B)   Specific Requirements:
      1.   All off street parking shall be calculated using the off street
parking schedule listed in subsection (C) of this section.
      2.   In addition to the requirements of the off street parking schedule,
nonresidential uses must also provide one space for each vehicle that is parked
at the property by the owner.
      3.   Parking spaces for accessory uses not specifically enumerated within
a parking class shall be assumed to be included in the principal (permitted or
special) use requirement. If, for any reason the classification of any use, for
the purpose of determining the amount of off street parking is not readily
ascertainable, the parking requirements for the use shall be established by the
zoning board. To determine the number of spaces required for a proposed use the
zoning board shall consider the number of parking spaces required for the
listed use most similar to the proposed use.
      4.   When computing the number of required parking spaces for a zoning
lot, the total number of required spaces shall be based upon all of the uses on
the zoning lot. Therefore, one principal use may actually contain two (2) or
more parking class uses (e.g., retail sales and warehousing, or warehousing and
offices).

   SCHEDULE OF SHARED PARKING CALCULATIONS
How To Use The Schedule Of Shared Parking Calculations: For each applicable
general land use category, calculate the number of spaces required for a use if
it were freestanding (refer to the regular schedule of parking requirements).
Use those figures for each land use to calculate the number of spaces required
for each time period for each use (6 time periods per use). For each time
period, add the number of spaces required for all applicable land uses to
obtain a grand total for each of the six (6) time periods. Select the time
period with the highest total parking requirement and use that total as your
shared parking requirement.

damages by reason of such sign or any part thereof, and such policy shall be
kept in full force, with proof of insurance furnished the village clerk, so
long as such sign shall remain.
   (M)   Modification Of Requirements: Whenever any sign to be erected or
structurally altered is surrounded by such development or unusual condition as
to make strict compliance difficult, or work a material hardship and an
injustice, the building inspector on request of the applicant, shall forward
the application, together with his recommendations to the village board.
Thereupon the village board shall refer the application to the village zoning
board of appeals for report and recommendations, which the board may, after

10-14-10: USES NOT INCLUDED WITHIN A SPECIFIC USE DISTRICT:
Because the uses hereinafter referred to possess unique characteristics making
it impractical to include them in a specific use district classification, they
shall be permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals under the conditions
specified, and after public hearing.
These uses require special consideration since they service an area larger than
the Village and require sizable land areas, creating problems of control with
reference to abutting use districts. Reference to those uses falling
specifically within the intent of this Section is as follows:
   (A)   Outdoor Theaters: Because outdoor theaters possess the unique
characteristic of being used only after darkness and since they develop a
concentration of vehicular traffic in terms of ingress and egress from their
parking area, they shall be permitted in I-1 District only. Outdoor theaters
shall further be subject to the following conditions:
      1.   The proposed internal design shall receive approval from the
Building Inspector and Village Engineer as to adequacy of drainage, lighting
and other technical aspects.
      2.   Points of ingress and egress shall be available to the outdoor
theater from abutting major thoroughfares and shall not be available from any
residential street.
      3.   All vehicles, waiting or standing to enter the facility, shall be
provided off-street waiting space. No vehicle shall be permitted to wait or
stand within a dedicated right of way.
      4.   The area shall be so laid out as to prevent the movie screen from
being viewed from residential areas or adjacent major thoroughfares. All
lighting used to illuminate the area shall be so installed as to be confined
within and directed to the premises of the outdoor theater site.
   (B)   Commercial Television and Radio Towers and Public Utility Microwaves,
and Public Utility T.V. Transmitting Towers: Radio and television towers,
public utility microwaves and public utility T.V. transmitting towers, and
their attendant facilities shall be permitted in I-1 and I-2 Districts provided
said use shall be located centrally on a continuous parcel of not less than one
times the height of the tower measured from the base of said tower to all
points on each property line.
   (C)   Benching and Terracing:
      1.   Permit Required: No person shall strip, excavate, grade or otherwise
remove top or underearth (hereinafter called land removal) except in connection
with the construction or alteration of a building on such premises and
excavating or grading incidental thereto, except after securing a permit from
the Building Inspector of the Village.
      2.   Plans and Specifications: All plans and specifications for land
removal shall be submitted with applications for a permit to conduct said land
removal. At the discretion of the Building Inspector, or upon request by the
Village Board, the applicant may be required to furnish a topographic map
showing the original and the proposed final contours of the final site. The
topographic map shall be drawn to a minimum horizontal scale of one inch equals
fifty feet (1" = 50') and two foot (2') contour intervals shall be indicated.
After the excavation is completed, the site shall be graded to conform to the
approved topographic map. The applicant has the right to appeal to the Village
Board if in disagreement with the Building Inspector.
The application shall be accompanied by the applicant's proposed methods for
the prevention of erosion. Such work may involve the construction of berms,
dams, sediment basins, slope drains, seeding and mulching or other methods to
prevent erosion. This erosion prevention schedule must be approved by the
Building Inspector prior to the start of work.
The Village Engineer shall review the site plan prior to approval and make
recommendations to the Building Inspector.
      3.   Prevention of Public Nuisances: During the period of land removal
authorized under paragraph 2 above, the permit holder shall erect such
temporary and permanent fences and take other measures as may be necessary to
keep said land removal area from becoming a public nuisance, including but not
limited to a control of blowing soil particles and the inundation of lower
lands because of the loss of vegetation in the land area. The Building
Inspector shall have the right to inspect the work at any time. When in the
opinion of the Building Inspector the land has a high potential for erosion,
the areas that can be exposed by land removal operations at any one time shall
be subject to approval by the Inspector and the duration of the exposure of the
uncompleted operation shall be as short as practicable.
      4.   Protection Of Yard Areas: At all times during land removal
authorized under subsection (C)2 of this Section, no part of said land removal
area can extend into what is defined as a yard area for use classification of
the land in question as described in Section 10-12-3 of this Title.
      5.   Specifications For Slopes, Benches And Vegetation: Benching and
terracing shall conform to the following:
         (a)   Slopes created by land removal shall not exceed a vertical rise
of one foot per horizontal two feet (1':2'); for each twenty five feet (25') of
elevation, a minimum twelve foot (12') berm or bench must be incorporated in
any terrace created or altered through land removal. If in the opinion of the
Village Engineer, the soil conditions do not allow these slopes, they may be
changed as directed. These changes may be required at any time it is deemed
necessary.
         (b)   Upon completion of land removal, the site shall be planted by
seeding or plugging with crown vetch or vegetation with equal qualities as
approved by the Building Inspector. The area shall be prepared to accept seed
or planting, fertilizer applied, and enough seed or plugs applied to
satisfactorily produce a suitable cover.
         (c)   The permit holder will be required to incorporate all permanent
erosion control features at the earliest practicable time as outlined in his
approved schedule.
      6.   Prevention Of Erosion: The Building Inspector has the authority to
limit the surface area of erodible material exposed by excavation and to direct
the permit holder to provide immediate permanent or temporary control measures
as necessary to prevent erosion. After completion of authorized land removal
under subsection (C)2 of this Section, the permit holder must, to the
satisfaction of the Building Inspector, cover all exposed earth with vegetation
leaving said land as near as possible to its former state but with vegetation
at least sufficient to prevent erosion of the land and to prevent the land from
being detrimental to or endangering public health, safety, comfort or general
welfare, considering the zoning use authorized for surrounding land. (The
standard used in considering what is detrimental or a danger to the public
after the land removal operation is completed is increased in severity over the
standard used in subsection (C)2 of this Section due to performance of the
condition.)
      7.   Bond Required: No permit to move over one thousand (1,000) cubic
yards shall be effective unless there is on file with the Village a cash bond
with a corporate surety in the penal sum equal to ten dollars ($10.00) per one
hundred (100) cubic yards of earth to be moved or portion thereof, but not less
than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to assure that:
         (a)   The permit holder, its agents and servants, will comply with all
the terms, conditions, provisions, requirements and specifications contained in
this subsection (C).
         (b)   The permit holder, his agents and servants, will save harmless
the Village from any expense incurred through the failure of the permittee, his
agents and servants to operate and maintain land removal operations as required
by this subsection (C), including any expense the Village may be put to for
correcting any condition or violation of this subsection (C) by the Village's
own labor and equipment, whenever the Village Board of Trustees determines it
is necessary for the Village to correct any condition in violation of this
subsection (C) or from any damages growing out of the negligence of the
permittee or his agents or servants; and
         (c)   Before acceptance, all bonds must be approved by the Village
Board of Trustees. If a corporate bond is offered, it is to be executed by a
company authorized to transact business in this State as a surety. If a cash
bond is offered, it shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the Village who
shall give his official receipt therefor, reciting that said cash has been
deposited in compliance with and subject to the provisions of this subsection
(C)7. No bond or surety shall be released until the requirements of these
regulations have been complied with. The permit holder will pay all costs for
engineering and inspection as approved by the Village. (Ord. 482, 4-7-1982)
      8.   Filing Fee: A filing fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for
each permit required to be secured from the Building Inspector of the Village
in accordance with the Benching and Terracing Act shall be paid to the Village
at the time of application for the permit. (Ord. 482Z, 8-13-1997)
10-14-11: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:

high. The obscuring fence may be eliminated where such fence will interfere
with traffic movement on public streets or thoroughfares.
   (B)   Glare: Glare from any process (such as or similar to arc welding or
acetylene torch cutting) which emits harmful rays shall be performed in such a
manner as not to extend beyond the property line, and as not to create a public
nuisance or hazard along lot lines.
   (C)   Grading: Grading, as it relates to residential structures, shall be so
developed as to drain surface water away from residential dwellings. A minimum
slope of one-fourth inch in one foot (1/4":1') shall be provided. (Ord. 482, 4-
7-1982)

stations, television stations or other transmitting entities including
necessary appurtenances such as a tower or towers may be erected above the
maximum height otherwise applicable to the location in question, upon approval
of an application for a special use for the transmitting tower or pole.
Provided, however, that no such special use may be authorized or continued
after authorization unless subsections (A) and (B) of this Section, are met by
all towers except self-supporting or monopole towers which are subject to
subsection (C) of this Section.
   (A)   Restrictions: No building other than nonhabitable accessory buildings
and structures and no public roadways shall be allowed within the zoned lot or
within the fall zone of the tower.
   (B)   No Buildings On Zoning Lot: The distance between the base of any
transmitting or other tower and the nearest property line of the zoning lot on

   (C)   Permanent Soil Erosion, Sediment And Stormwater Control Measures:
      1.   Erosion And Sediment Control Measures: All control measures required
under this section shall conform to the design criteria, standards, and
specifications provided in the applicable standards, referenced in appendix B
attached to the ordinance codified herein, now in effect or as hereafter
amended. All control measures installed shall be sufficient to prevent
observable sediment from leaving the site during a 5-year frequency storm
event. All sediment that moves off site due to construction activity will be
cleaned up before the end of the same workday. All sediment that moves off site
due to storm events will be cleaned up before the end of the next workday. For
example, installing a rock construction drive or cleaning tires could be used
to minimize tracking of sediment onto public roads.
      2.   Permanent Stormwater Control Measures: Stormwater detention
facilities shall be designed for a minimum 25-year rainfall event and ten (10)
minute duration. Each stormwater detention area shall be provided with a method
of emergency overflow in the event that a rainfall event in excess of a 25-year
rainfall event occurs. This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to
function without attention or maintenance. Detention facilities shall be
designed to have a dry bottom except when inundated immediately following a
storm event. The stormwater runoff rate from the site shall not exceed the 2-
year predevelopment stormwater runoff rate from the site. Evaluation of
submitted plans shall be based on the stormwater design analysis and example in
appendix A attached to the ordinance codified herein.
      3.   Regional Stormwater Control Systems: To allow for the beneficial
development and maintenance of regional stormwater management systems, where
they are available and they are appropriate, an applicant may submit a design
dependent on such a system. The applicant may submit documentation of the
approval for the use of the regional stormwater management facility from the
governmental agency having jurisdiction over it. The applicant shall submit
evidence showing that there will be no adverse flooding impact to any receiving
stream between the point of discharge and the regional stormwater facility. If
the erosion control administrator approves the use of a regional stormwater
management system, the applicant shall be exempt from the requirements in this
section for permanent on site stormwater controls. Such exemption shall not
apply to any temporary stormwater control measures required by this section.
   (D)   Temporary Soil Erosion, Sediment And Stormwater Control Measures:
      1.   Temporary Control Measures Required: On site sediment control
measures shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating land
disturbing activities on the site. Fully functioning temporary sediment control
measures (including, but not limited to, perimeter sediment controls) shall
remain in place until the ground is stabilized with permanent ground cover. In
cases where it is not practical to leave the temporary sediment control
measures in place prior to establishing permanent ground cover (for example,
when control measures need to be removed in order to grade the area or install
pavement or sod), an exception will be made only if one of the conditions
listed below will be met. In no way does adhering to one of the conditions
below relieve the owner of responsibility to clean up or repair any damages
caused from sediment or stormwater runoff leaving the site.
      2.   Permanent Ground Cover: Permanent ground cover shall be established
with pavement, aggregate or sod within three (3) working days of the removal of
temporary sediment barriers; or
      3.   Permanent Vegetation: Permanent vegetation shall be established by
seeding with anchored mulch or erosion control blanket within three (3) working
days of final grading in the spring or fall seeding periods. All disturbed
areas must have permanent ground cover established within six (6) months of the
project completion, or within six (6) months of occupancy, whichever comes
first. Summer seeding is acceptable on project areas which shall be watered.
This does not apply to concentrated flow areas.
      4.   Maintenance: Sediment control measures and temporary stormwater
control measures are to be maintained so they are operating effectively until
permanent ground surface protection and permanent stormwater control measures
are established in a manner specified in the applicable permit issued pursuant
to this section.
      5.   Additional Control Measures: The erosion control administrator may
require additional control measures pursuant to the standards if determined as
necessary after site inspection, and prior to issuing the permit.
   (E)   Retrofitting Presently Developed Sites: In instances where the project
involves a presently developed site, the applicant may request an exemption
from fully complying with the stormwater control requirements. The erosion
control administrator shall determine the type and extent of compliance
required based on existing and proposed site conditions, and the impact of
stormwater runoff on the surrounding area. This exemption will only be granted
in cases where the proposed condition of the site will not be significantly
different from the existing condition as determined by the erosion control
administrator. The purpose of this subsection is to allow for alterations to
presently developed sites without a major redesign of the existing (or
nonexisting) stormwater system, while assuring that all projects will be moving
closer to compliance with the stormwater control requirements of this section.
   (F)   Residential; Erosion And Sediment Control Permit: Before commencing
any project involving construction of a new single- or two-family dwelling,
addition, garage or foundation, or commencing on any project disturbing an area
greater than five thousand (5,000) square feet, the owner of the land, or his
representative, shall file an application for a residential (1- and 2-family
dwelling) erosion and sediment control permit, accompanied by a residential

10-15-4: DISPLAY OF PROPERTY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER:
In order to aid in the identification of property locations, it is necessary
that each property in the village of Creve Coeur be adequately and properly
identified by street number and location.
Each owner or person in possession or control of any parcel of property located
within the boundaries of the village shall post the street address
identification number assigned to said property in a conspicuous manner either
upon any improvement located thereon or in the yard immediately adjacent to
said improvement. Such display shall be in a conspicuous manner so as to allow
the easy observation of the same from the roadway immediately adjacent to and
in front of each parcel of property. (Ord. 625, 10-13-2004; amd. Ord. 882, - -
2019)
10-15-5: VARIATIONS:
   (A)   The zoning board, after a public hearing, may recommend a variation
the regulations of this title in harmony with the general purposes and intent
of this title, and where the zoning board makes findings of fact, in accordance
with the standards hereinafter prescribed, that there are practical
difficulties or particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict
letter of the regulations of this title.
   (B)   Any person having a freehold interest in land, or a possessory
interest entitled to exclusive possession thereof, or a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest which
is specifically enforceable, may file an application to vary the regulations of
this title.
   (C)   Application For Variations And Notice of Hearing: An application for a
variation shall be filed in writing with the building inspector on a form
prescribed by the zoning board. The application shall contain such information
as the zoning board may require by rule. Upon receipt of an application for a
variation, the zoning board shall hold at least one public hearing on the
proposed variation. Notice of the public hearing shall be published at least
once not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the village. The notice shall
contain the particular location for which the variation is requested, including
the common street address and property index number, as well as brief statement
of what the proposed variation consists of. The published notice may be
supplemented by an additional form of notice as the zoning board, by rule, may
require.
   (D)   Standards For Variations: The zoning board shall not recommend a
variation and village board shall not vary the regulations of this title, as
authorized in this section, unless it makes findings based upon the evidence
presented to it in each specific case that:
      1.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape,
topographical conditions, or other extraordinary conditions of the specific
property involved, a practical difficulty or particular hardship to the owner
would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter
of the regulations were to be carried out.
      2.   The conditions upon which an application for a variation is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification.
      3.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property.
      4.   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this title and has
not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the property.
      5.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located.
      6.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of the
public street, increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
   In granting a variance the zoning board shall issue a written
recommendation, which shall include findings of fact specifying the reasons for
granting the variation. The zoning board may also impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the property benefited by the variation as it deems necessary
to comply with the standards established in this section, to reduce or minimize
the effect of such variation upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to
better carry out the general purposes and intent of this title.
   (E)   Authorized Variations: Variations from the regulations of this title
shall be granted by the zoning board only in accordance with the standards
established in this section, and may only be granted with respect to the
following matters:
      1.   To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or a setback
required by the applicable regulations.
      2.   To permit the erection and use of a building or use of premises for
public utility purposes, and make exceptions therefore to the height and bulk
district requirements herein established.
      3.   To permit the modification of the automobile parking spaces or
loading space(s) requirements herein established.
      4.   To permit the modification of the height and area regulations herein
established.
   (F)   Decisions: The concurring vote of four (4) members of the zoning board
shall be necessary to recommend approval of a variation. The zoning board shall
only recommend approval of a variation upon evidence that it meets the
standards established in this section. The recommendation of the zoning board
shall be set forth in writing with the findings of fact specifying the reasons
(s) for recommending approval of the variation.
   The village board may grant or deny any application for a variation. The
village board shall only grant a variation upon evidence that it meets the
standards established in this section. The decision of the village board shall
be set forth in writing with the findings of fact specifying the reasons(s) for
granting the variation. In addition, any application for a variation which
fails to receive a recommendation for approval by the zoning board shall not be
approved by the village board except upon a vote of two-thirds of the trustees
then holding office.
   No order of the village board granting a variation shall be valid for a
period longer than one (1) year from the date of such order unless a building
permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration of a
building is commenced or the use of the property is commenced and completed in
accordance with the terms of such permit. A property for which a variation has
been granted shall not violate the conditions and restrictions imposed or
findings of fact issued by village board unless changed by further appeal in
accordance with this section. (Ord. 882, - -2019)
10-15-6: SPECIAL USES:
   (A)   The development and execution of this title is based upon the division
of the village into districts, within which districts the uses of land and
buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to
the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use at the given location. Such special uses fall into
two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Any person having a freehold interest in land, or a possessory
interest entitled to exclusive possession thereof, or a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory interest which
is specifically enforceable, may file an application to use land for one or
more of the special uses provided for in this title in the zoning district in
which the land is located.
   (C)   Application For Special Use: An application for a special use permit
shall be filed with the building inspector on a form prescribed by the zoning
board. The application shall be accompanied by such plans or data prescribed by
the zoning board, including, but not limited to, a statement in writing by the
applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed special use will
conform to the standards set forth in this section.
   In addition, an applicant for a special use permit shall include with the
application a list of the owners, as recorded in the office of the Tazewell
County recorder of deeds and as appears from the authentic tax records of such
county, of all property within two hundred fifty (250) feet in each direction
of the location for which the special use is requested; provided, the number of
feet occupied by all public roads, streets, alleys and other public ways shall
be excluded in computing the two hundred fifty (250) feet requirement.
   (D)   Hearing On Application: Upon receipt of an application the zoning
board shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed special use. Not
more than thirty (30) days or less than fifteen (15) days in advance of such
hearing, notice of time and place of such hearing shall be published at least
once in a newspaper of general circulation in the village, as prescribed by the
Illinois Municipal Code. The notice shall contain the particular location in
which the special use is requested, including the common street address and
property index number, and a brief statement of the requested special use.
   The zoning board shall also, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than
fifteen (15) days before the hearing at which the application for special use
is to be considered, send written notice to the persons within two hundred
fifty (250) feet of the subject property appearing on the list required herein
to be furnished by the applicant, which shall contain the time and place of the
hearing, the address of the requested special use, the name and address of the
applicant for special use, and a brief statement of the nature of the requested
special use.
   Supplemental or additional notices may be published or distributed as the
zoning board may, by rule, prescribe from time to time.
   (E)   Authorization Of Special Use: The concurring vote of four (4) members
of the zoning board shall be necessary to recommend approval of an application
for a special use permit. The zoning board shall only recommend approval of a
special use upon evidence that it meets the standards established in this
section. The recommendation of the zoning board shall be set forth in writing
with the findings of fact, and shall include any stipulations or additional
conditions and guarantees, which must be complied with as the zoning board
deems necessary for the protection of the public interest.
   The village board may grant or deny any application for a special use
permit. The village board shall only grant an application for special use upon
evidence that it meets the standards established in this section. The decision
of the village board shall be set forth in writing with the findings of fact,
and shall include any stipulations or additional conditions and guarantees,
which must be complied with as the village board deems necessary for the
protection of the public interest. In addition, any application for a special
use permit which fails to receive a recommendation for approval by the zoning
board shall not be approved by the village board except upon a vote of two-
thirds of the trustees then holding office.
   (F)   Standards: No special use shall be recommended by the zoning board for
approval or granted by village board unless it shall make findings based upon
the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      1.   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or
general welfare.
      2.   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
      3.   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and
orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
      4.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
      5.   Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and
egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
      6.   The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the village board pursuant to
the recommendations of the zoning board.
      7.   Where it is found a use not otherwise acceptable to the neighborhood
in which it is located would be acceptable with certain conditions of use
operation and improvement, the zoning board may recommend and the village board
may require the granting of such special use subject to specified conditions.
Such conditions may include:
         (a)   Landscape screening or fencing.
         (b)   Hours of operation.
         (c)   Night lighting (including parking areas) so as not to be
annoying to surrounding properties.
         (d)   Requirements for access lanes and parking areas to protect
pedestrian safety.
         (e)   Restraint on signage so as to be compatible with surrounding
properties.
         (f)   Limitation on outdoor storage.
         (g)   Where any site plan expansion is proposed.
         (h)   Any other such requirements which, in the opinion of the zoning
board of appeals or council, would render the use compatible with surrounding
properties.
   (G)   Termination Of Special Uses: Any special use authorized by the village
board shall be deemed to have automatically terminated upon the occurrence of
any of the following:
      1.   The failure to establish the special use within one (1) year after
authority to establish the special use is granted by the village board.
      2.   After establishment of a special use, the discontinuation of that
use for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.
      3.   The violation of any condition, stipulation or agreement placed upon
the special use by the village board.
   In the event that a special use authorized with respect to any property
within the village is discontinued, abandoned or terminated as provided in this
section, the only uses which may be established on that property are the
permitted uses authorized under the zoning regulations applicable to that
property or any special use authorized by the village board which has not been
terminated, discontinued or abandoned in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
   (H)   Effect Of Special Use Permit: Upon the authorization of any special
use with respect to a given property, any person entitled by any possessory
interest to utilize that property may establish the authorized special use but
only in accordance with any conditions, stipulations or agreements applicable
to such special use. In the alternative, any such person may establish with
respect to such parcel any permitted use authorized by the zoning regulations
applicable to the district in which the parcel is located. (Ord. 882, - -2019)
10-15-7: APPEALS:
An appeal may be taken to the zoning board by any person or by any office,
department, board or bureau within the village aggrieved by a decision of the
building inspector or other authorized official. Such an appeal shall be taken
within forty-five (45) days from the date of the action complained of, by
filing with the building inspector and with the zoning board a notice of appeal
in accordance with Title 2, Chapter 9 of this code. (Ord. 882, - -2019)

   (A)   Built on a single chassis;
   (B)   Four hundred (400) square feet or less in size;
   (C)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SFHA: See definition of floodplain.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date
the building permit was issued. This, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or
other improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of
a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage
of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a
substantial improvement, actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE: See definition of "building".
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cumulative percentage of damage subsequent to the adoption of this chapter
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed.
Volunteer labor and materials must be included in this determination. The term
includes "repetitive loss buildings" (see definition).
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: (A) Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a structure taking place subsequent to the adoption of this
chapter in which the cumulative percentage of improvements:
      1. Equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
      2. Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
   (B)   "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive
loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.
The term does not include:
      1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
State or local Health, Sanitary, or Safety Code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
      2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places.
   VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the required Federal, State, and/or local permits
and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided. (Ord. 828, 11-9-2016)

delineated as an "A Zone" on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of
Tazewell County shall be according to the best data available from Federal,
State or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must
be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations.
   (D)   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of those parts of
unincorporated Tazewell County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the Village of Creve Coeur, or that may be annexed into the
Village of Creve Coeur, shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles
in the Flood Insurance Study of Tazewell County prepared by the Federal

by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has
not been filled after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map is
not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the provisions of this
chapter.
The building inspector shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map
identification.
The building inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant
copies of all other Federal, State, and local permits, approvals or permit-not-
required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The building
inspector shall not issue a permit unless all other Federal, State, and local
permits have been obtained. (Ord. 828, 11-9-2016)

10-17-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals
for a variance. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Village
Board. The Village Board may attach such conditions to granting of a variance
as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   Conditions: No variance shall be granted unless the applicant
demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other State and Federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   Notification: The Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant in
writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protections
standards of section
10-17-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a
building will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property, and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic Structures: Variances to the building protection requirements
of section
10-17-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
10-17-6 and
10-17-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and
wet-floodproofed.
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with
section
10-17-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
10-17-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section

heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free

the Village of Creve Coeur or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 828, 11-9-2016)
10-17-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to

violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Village Attorney may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
Village Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the

on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The Village of Creve Coeur shall record a notice of violation on the
title of the property.
   (B)   The Village Attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
The Village Attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension
of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate
the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to
resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the Village of Creve Coeur from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord.

11-2-2: Pre-Application Procedure
11-2-3: Procedure For Conditional Approval of Preliminary Plat
11-2-4: Procedure For Approval of Final Plat
11-2-5: Boundary Maps
11-2-1: PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS:
   (A)   Regulatory: No land, after the effective date of this Title, shall be
subdivided within the Village or within one and one-half (11/2) miles thereof
over which the Village has jurisdiction, the plats thereof filed or recorded,
nor any street laid out, nor any improvement made to such subdivision or
subdivided land, until the plat or plats of the subdivision have been certified
to and approved by action specified herein.
   (B)   Conformity With Comprehensive Plan: The layout of the subdivision
shall be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan.
No land shall be subdivided for any use unless access to the land over streets
exists or shall be provided for by the subdivider in the manner as provided
herein.
   (C)   Advisory: In order to conserve time, effort and expenses, the
subdivider may consult with the Zoning Board and the Plat Officer prior to the
preparation of the tentative plan of the subdivision. Requirements for streets,
school, parks or recreational sites; shopping centers, community facilities,
sanitation, water facilities, and drainage, and relation to other developments,
existing and proposed, in the vicinity shall be analyzed in advance of the
preparation of the preliminary plat. (Ord .962, 10-26-2022)
11-2-2: PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
Prior to the filing of an application for conditional approval of the
Preliminary Plat, the subdivider may submit to the Plat Officer, a sketch plan
showing the proposed layout of the entire tract in relation to existing
topography, together with a copy of existing covenants, if known. This step
shall not require formal application, nor any fee nor the filing of a plat with
the Clerk.
Within ten (10) days after receipt of the sketch plan, the Plat Officer shall
inform the subdivider in writing that the plans and data as submitted or as
modified do, or do not meet the requirements of this Title. When the plans and
data do not meet such requirements, the Plat Officer shall state the reasons in
writing and deliver a copy to the subdivider.
11-2-3: PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAT:
The subdivider shall, after the above preapplication procedure, cause to be
prepared a preliminary plat together with improvement plans and other
supplementary material as specified in Chapter 5, Section 2, of this Title,
including an alternate layout in sketch form of the entire tract owned by the
subdivider, if not submitted under Section
11-2-2 hereof.
Sufficient copies, not less than three (3) of the preliminary application, the
preliminary plat and all required supplementary material shall be filed with
the Plat Officer, to meet the distribution requirements of the Village.
The Plat Officer shall forthwith transmit one copy to the Village Engineer and
one copy to the Zoning Board and he shall retain the third copy for his office.
The Village Engineer and the Zoning Board shall review the plat, and each shall
submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the Plat Officer. Such
report shall be submitted within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the plat.
Failure to submit a report within the specified time limit or a mutually agreed
extension thereof, shall be deemed a recommendation of approval of the plat.
Following review of the preliminary plat and accompanying supplemental
material, and review and consideration of the reports provided for herein, the
Plat Officer shall take action accordingly, approving, revising or rejecting
the proposed subdivision, and he shall in writing so notify the subdivider, the
Zoning Board, and the Village Engineer.
If the action of the Plat Officer is that of approving the preliminary plat, he
shall properly endorse his approval and date of such approval on all copies of
the plat. One copy of the plat shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy
shall be furnished the Village Engineer and one copy shall be retained by the
Plat Officer. If revisions are to be made, said revisions shall be indicated on
the plats before and prior to their endorsement. Such preliminary plat shall
bear the certificate of approval as follows:
   “STATE OF ILLINOIS )
      ) ss.
   County of Tazewell   )
   I,                    Plat Officer of the Village of Creve Coeur, do hereby
approve this Preliminary Plat in accordance with the provisions of the
Subdivision Ordinance of Creve Coeur, Illinois, this          day of          ,
A.D.       . This approval is not authority for recording of the above Plat.
                                                                 
   Plat Officer, Village of Creve Coeur, Ill.”
If the Plat Officer rejects the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall have the
right to appeal the decision to the Village Board, which Board may suspend the
Plat Officer’s decision or may modify or reverse, in whole or in part, his
decision. If the Village Board approves the preliminary plat, then the Plat
Officer shall be directed by motion passed in a meeting of the Village Board,
to endorse the plat.
Approval of the preliminary plat shall be construed to be an expression of
approval of the general layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of the
final plat, and to be assurance to the subdivider that the final plat will be
approved if it conforms to the terms of the conditional approval and this
Title, in force at the time of submitting and obtaining approval of the
preliminary plat. (Ord. 962, 10-26-2022)
11-2-4: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT:
Not later than one year after approval of the preliminary plat, or such
additional time as the Plat Officer may allow, the subdivider may submit the
original tracing of an intended final plat, together with a print thereof to
the Plat Officer.
The final plat shall conform to the preliminary plat as approved and it may
constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which the
subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time; provided however, that
such portion conforms to all requirements of this Title.
Within twenty (20) days after receipt of plats and supplementary material, the
Plat Officer shall inform the subdivider that the plans and data submitted or
as modified, do or do not meet the requirements of this Title. When the plans
and data do not meet the requirements of this Title, the Plat Officer shall, in
writing, state the reasons and deliver a copy to the subdivider.
Final approval of a final plat shall be granted by the Plat Officer on the
basis of its conformity with the preliminary plat as approved, and with all
pertinent laws, rules, regulations and particularly with the requirements of
Chapters 4 and 5 of this Title, and with the Comprehensive Plan. The Plat
Officer shall notify the subdivider and his Engineer of the action taken, and
also the Village Engineer and Zoning Board.
In the event that only a portion of the approved preliminary plat is presented
for final approval, the Plat Officer may notify the subdivider in writing
whether or not the preliminary approval of the unrecorded portion has been
renewed for one year. In the absence of such written notification, the
subdivider may within one year after conditional approval of the preliminary
plat apply to the Plat Officer for extension of the conditional approval of the
preliminary plat without being required to pay additional fees.
An estimate of expenditures, covering the cost of the improvements required by
this Title shall be submitted with the final plat. This estimate of
expenditures shall be verified by the Village Engineer for accuracy and
adequacy, which verification shall be submitted with the final plat and data
required in this Title when presented to the Village Board for approval.
No final plat of any subdivision shall be approved for recording in the Office
of the Tazewell County Recorder of Deeds, unless (1) the improvements required
in this Title have been completed and approved prior to final recording
approval, or (2) the subdivider shall file with the Village Clerk a surety
bond, cashier’s or certified check of the amount determined from the estimate
of expenditures, guaranteeing to the Village that such improvements shall be
constructed and completed in a satisfactory manner, within the period of time
specified by the Plat Officer, but not to exceed one year. Property owners
signator of surety bonds, shall provide guaranteed evidence of their ownership
of real estate pledged and that it is free and clear of other obligations,
including the payments of real estate taxes and special assessments. The form
of said bonds and checks shall be approved to the satisfaction of the Village
Attorney and shall be made payable to the Village of Creve Coeur, Illinois, or
its benefit.
When approved, the final plat shall bear the following certificate:
   “STATE OF ILLINOIS )
      ) ss.
   County of Tazewell   )
   I,                    Village of Creve Coeur Plat Officer, do hereby approve
this Final Plat in accordance with the provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance
of the Village of Creve Coeur, Tazewell County, Illinois, this          day of
         , A.D.         .
                                            
   Creve Coeur Plat Officer.”
Within sixty (60) days after approval of the final plat by the Plat Officer,
said plat shall be filed by the subdivider with the County Recorder, and if not
so filed, shall have no validity and shall not thereafter be recorded without
recertification by the Plat Officer. All plats (original tracings of said
plats) after being recorded, shall become the property of the County, and kept
by them for safe keeping.
For the approval of any final plat, as hereinabove required, the subdivider
shall pay into the General Fund of the Village as a fee for such approval, the
sum of one dollar ($1.00) for each lot, sublot, tract or parcel of land shown
upon any plat to be approved as a subdivision, and provided, further, that the
said fee for the approval of any plat shall be not less than ten dollars
($10.00). In addition to said fees set forth above, the subdivider shall
reimburse the Village for all engineering expenses of checking plats, water,
sewer and other plans, specifications, data, contours and for inspection of
construction of the facilities required by this Title, and all legal fees in
connection with said subdivision or relating thereto or to checking titles,
bonds, financial matters or the like; all costs to be paid prior to final
approval of the plat. (Ord. 962, 10-26-2022)
11-2-5: BOUNDARY MAPS:
Any parcel of land may be divided into two (2) parts, either of which part is
less than five (5) acres, for the purpose of ownership, transfer or building
development provided no new street or easement of access is required, by
submitting an adequate map, certified by a Licensed Illinois Land Surveyor.
Such boundary map shall bear the certification of the County Clerk that there
are no delinquent taxes and/or assessments against the land or parcel described
in the boundary plat or map.
Such boundary shall bear a certificate of approval, signed by the Plat Officer,
as follows:
   “STATE OF ILLINOIS )
      ) ss.

boundary map in accordance with the provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance of
Creve Coeur, Illinois, this       day of         , A.D.       .
                                            
   Creve Coeur Plat Officer.”
No such boundary map shall be recorded or have any validity until it has been
signed and approved by the Plat Officer. The Plat Officer shall file one copy
of such boundary map in his office, the Plat Officer shall make a record of
such map and he shall not sign another boundary map further dividing said land
within two (2) years of the date of the approval thereof. In addition, any such
boundary map must otherwise comply with zoning requirements, lot sizes and the
like, if for other than merely increasing one’s needed or desired lot size.
Any survey plat of a parcel of land, which parcel is not part of a subdivision
as defined for the purpose of this Title, shall be entitled to recording,
provided it shall be endorsed with the following certification, signed and
sealed by the Illinois Registered Land Surveyor preparing the plat: “I hereby
certify at this parcel of land is not part of a subdivision requiring Village
approval under the Subdivision Ordinance of the Village of Creve Coeur,

subdivisions:
The design of the subdivision shall be in harmony with and shall conform with
the Comprehensive Plan and shall be in accordance with good subdivision design
principles not otherwise set forth herein.
Natural features, such as distinctive trees or vegetation, streams, ponds,
hilltops, bluffs, creek bottoms and outlook stations or views shall be
preserved and enhanced wherever possible. In laying out a subdivision due
consideration shall be given to aesthetic features existing within the tract
being subdivided and which may add to the aesthetic quality of existing nearby
subdivisions.
11-3-2: STREETS:
The course, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, to topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety,
and their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of land to be served by
such streets and they shall conform to the following design standards:
Where not shown on the Comprehensive Plan, the arrangement of streets in a
subdivision shall either:
   (A)   Provide for the continuation of projection of existing principal
streets in surrounding area; or
   (B)   Conform to Thoroughfare Plan where applicable; or
   (C)   Conform to topographic or other conditions where continuance or
projection of existing streets is impractical or undesirable from the community
standpoint.
Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged.
All new subdivisions along State and County Highways shall be arranged to
provide direct access to such Highways at intervals not less than one thousand
three hundred twenty feet (1,320'), except where impractical or impossible due
to existing property divisions or topography or due to undue traffic
concentration at points of such access. Also, roads and streets within such
subdivision shall be arranged to permit access to adjacent future subdivisions
without encroachment upon this regulation.
No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent (.5%). No street
grade on major streets shall be more than five percent (5%) and on minor
streets shall not exceed nine percent (9%).
   (A)   Street Intersections: Streets shall be laid out to intersect at nearly
as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at
less than seventy degrees (70°).
Street intersections with center line offsets of less than one hundred twenty
five feet (125') are prohibited.
   (B)   Horizontal Deflection of Street Lines: Where connecting street lines
deflect from each other more than ten degrees (10'), they shall be connected
with a curb with a radius adequate to assure sight distance.
A tangent at least one hundred feet (100') long shall be introduced between
reverse curves on major and collector streets, where the curve radius is less
than five hundred feet (500').
   (C)   Alleys should not be permitted in residential districts.
   (D)   Right-of-Way: Street right-of-way widths not shown in the
Comprehensive Plan should not be less than the following:

Alleys                        25 feet
 
In a subdivision that adjoins or includes an existing street that does not
conform to the right-of-way width required above, one-half (1/2) of the
additional width shall be provided along each side of such street for the
entire frontage included within the land being subdivided, or as the Plat
Officer may determine is proper.
Dead-End Streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than six
hundred feet (600'), unless limitation of the site by reason of topography or
existing development make impractical development except with a longer length.
They shall be provided with a circular turn around having an outside surface
diameter of at least one hundred feet (100'). The center of the turn around
shall be located between the center line of the street and its right-of-way
line, facing into the turn around.
All streets shall be public and dedicated to the Village.
Reserve strips controlling access to street right-of-way shall not be permitted
except upon approval of the Plat Officer and when control and disposition of
the reserved strip is vested in the Village.

The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with regard to:
   (A)   Provision for adequate building sites for the special type of use
contemplated.
   (B)   Requirements as to lot size and dimensions.
   (C)   Needs for convenient access circulation, control and safety of street
traffic.
   (D)   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
In cases where the block length exceeds six hundred feet (600') and where
deemed essential by the Plat Officer to provide pedestrian circulation to
schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and other community facilities, a right-
of-way dedicated to the public use for a walk way not less than ten feet (10')
wide shall be provided and dedicated.
11-3-5: LOTS:
All provisions of the Zoning Ordinance (Title 10 of this Code) concerning lots
shall apply, including lot area, width, and depth. No parcel, remainder, gore,
outlot or remnant of land which is part of the tract being subdivided shall be
created which by reason of lot width, depth, area, frontage, topography, or
lack of access thereto, cannot be used as a zoning lot, or be subject to
further subdivision in accordance with the terms of this Title. Any remaining
parcel or outlot which cannot be made to comply with the foregoing shall be
eliminated by combining the area thereof with one or more adjoining lots which
do comply, or by conveying the same for appropriate public use, subject to
acceptance of the same by some public body.
The lot shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the
subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated.
Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except where
essential to provide separation or residential development from major streets
or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines
except where topography or drainage conditions warrant angling lot lines, or
where turn arounds of a permanent type are required.
11-3-6: PARKS, PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES:
When a proposed park, playground or school is shown in the Comprehensive Plan,
or in the opinion of the Plat Officer is necessary for the public welfare, the
Plat Officer may require the reservation of the appropriate area, not to exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the area within the subdivision. Upon the approval of
a final plat containing the reservation for such public use, the corporate
authorities having jurisdiction of such use, be it a school board, park board,
or other authority, shall acquire the land so designated by purchase, or
commence proceedings to acquire such land by condemnation, within one year from
the date of the filing of such plat; and if it does not do so, the land so
designated may then be used by the subdivider in any other manner consistent

Notwithstanding the requirements set forth above, no additional paved width,
curb, gutter, base course or surface shall be required on an existing improved
street which is a part of the state, county or township road system, where the
land being developed abuts said street. A sidewalk, however, shall be required
for the full frontage of the subdivision on collector streets. (Ord. 351, 10-1-
1969)
11-4-4: SANITARY SEWERS:
When the sanitary sewer system is conveniently available, the subdivider shall
connect the subdivision with that sanitary sewer or some other municipally
owned sanitary sewer system.
Under special conditions, the subdivider may be permitted to construct a
separate sanitary sewer system to serve the subdivision, provided he complies
with the requirements of the Illinois department of public health in the
construction of such sanitary sewer facilities, and upon the further direction
and recommendation of the village engineer. Upon satisfactory completion
thereof, the entire installation, mains, connectors, disposal plant and system
shall be turned over to the village or Creve Coeur sanitary district, who
shall, at no cost to either the village or district, be and become the owner in

completion of construction and acceptance thereof, the entire system, mains,
valves, hydrants, storage tanks, pumps, controls and the like, shall be turned
over to the village within one year, together with all easements, land or
rights, without cost to the village, and thereafter and upon acceptance
thereof, the village shall be the owner in fee of all said property and
facilities and shall thereafter operate and maintain said system. (Ord. 351,
10-1-1969)
11-4-7: STORM DRAINAGE:
The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with an adequate storm sewer
system and stormwater controls including submitting any necessary plans and
drawings in conformity with the village stormwater control ordinance as
described in section
10-14-15 of this code. Such system shall be designed by a registered,
professional engineer authorized to practice in this state. Such plans then
shall be submitted to and examined by the village engineer for approval,
correction or modification. (Ord. 351, 10-1-1969; amd. Ord. 661, 9-10-2008)
A storm sewer system shall be provided wherever curbs are installed, and where
the evidence available indicates to the plat officer that the natural surface
drainage is inadequate.
Where the surface drainage is deemed adequate, easements for such surface
drainage may be required to be obtained by the subdivider. (Ord. 351, 10-1-
1969)
All storm drainage facilities, land, easements and rights shall remain the
responsibility and property of the subdivision and shall not become the
property of the village, upon acceptance of the subdivision plat, and

stormwater drainage facilities and easements. If the subdivision retains
responsibility for stormwater drainage facilities, land, and improvements, the
subdivider shall submit for approval and then record as part of the
restrictions for the subdivision provisions providing for the maintenance,
repair and replacement of the improvements and easements. If the subdivision
fails to keep the improvements maintained and in proper repair, the village may
make any necessary repairs, replacement and maintenance and may charge the
subdivider if the subdivider retains any interest in the subdivided property
and the owners of the lots in the subdivision. The subdivision plans submitted

11-4-8: UNDERGROUND UTILITIES:
All utilities, electric, telephone, water, sewer, cablevision and all other
utilities, shall be placed underground or if such cannot reasonably be done in
the opinion of the village, then such installations so far as is possible,
shall be placed on easements at the rear of the lots or such other place as the
village engineer and plat officer determine to be necessary either because of
circumstances, topography or undue hardships. (Ord. 351, 10-1-1969)
11-4-9: MODIFICATION:

other physical conditions peculiar to the site, the Zoning Board, together with
the recommendations of the village engineer and plat officer, may authorize
minor modifications in the application of such provisions as, in their opinion
and for reasons set forth in minutes of the commission, will not materially
