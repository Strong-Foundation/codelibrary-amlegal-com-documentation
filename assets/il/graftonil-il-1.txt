to advise the Council and the public of the materials presented.

Council may ask the chair for clarification of the motion under consideration.

meetings on a vote of a majority of all the Aldermen authorized by law to be
elected.

the motion shall specify a time certain for further consideration of the motion
or proposition.
      2.   A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not open the main question

      3.   A motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time shall
not be construed as a motion to postpone indefinitely, but shall be considered
to be of the same general nature and to possess the same general attributes so
far as applicable under these rules, as a motion to postpone indefinitely or to
a time certain.
   W.   Motion To Refer: A motion to refer to a standing committee shall take
precedence over a similar motion to refer to a special committee.

appertaining thereto.

      1.   A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the same
meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A motion for

renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be reconsidered.
      2.   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by Aldermen who
voted on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless
otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received
a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground
that a greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the
passage or adoption of such motion, then in such case, a motion to reconsider
may be made and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such
question to be reconsidered.
   BB.   Adoption Of “Robert’s Rules of Order Revised”: The rules of

lewd or disgraceful manner, or who uses opprobrious, obscene and insulting

present, or expelled by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all Aldermen elected.
(2006 Code § 1-2-11; amd. Ord. 743, 5-6-2021)
1-7-6:   ORDINANCES, RESOLUTIONS AND MOTIONS:
   A.   Preparation: It shall be the duty of the City Attorney to prepare such
ordinances as may be required by the City Council.
   B.   Consideration: When a proposed ordinance is considered, it shall be
read one time by title only unless the City Council shall otherwise
specifically direct.
   C.   Vote Required; Record Kept: The passage of all ordinances for whatever
purpose, and of any resolution or motion: 1) to create any liability against a
city; or 2) for the expenditure or appropriation of its money, shall require
the concurrence of a majority of all members then holding office on the City
Council, including the Mayor, unless otherwise expressly provided by this Code
or any other act governing the passage of any ordinance, resolution, or motion;
provided, that where the Council consists of an odd number of Aldermen, the
vote of the majority of the Aldermen shall be sufficient to pass an ordinance.
The yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of the
designated ordinances, resolutions, or motions and recorded in the journal of
the City Council. In addition, the Corporate Authorities at any meeting may, by
unanimous consent, take a single vote by yeas or nays on the several questions
of the passage on any two (2) or more of the designated ordinances, orders,
resolutions or motions placed together for voting purposes in a single group.
The single vote shall be entered separately in the journal under the
designation “omnibus vote”, and in such event, the Clerk may enter the words
“omnibus vote” or “consent agenda” in the journal in each case in lieu of
entering names of the members of City Council voting “yea” and of those voting
“nay” on the passage of each of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions
and motions included in such omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of
such single or omnibus vote and such entries of the words “omnibus vote” or
“consent agenda” in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance with the
requirements of this section to all intents and purposes and with like effect
as if the vote in each case had been separately by yeas and nays on the
question of the passage of each ordinance, order, resolution and motion
included in such omnibus group, and separately recorded in the journal.
Likewise, the yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of
any other resolution or motion at the request of any Alderman and shall be
recorded in the journal.
   D.   Approval; Veto: All resolutions and motions: 1) which create any
liability against the City; or 2) that provide for the expenditure or
appropriation of its money; or 3) to sell any City property, and all ordinances
passed by the City Council shall be deposited with the City Clerk. If the Mayor
approves an ordinance or resolution, the Mayor shall sign it. Those ordinances,
resolutions and motions which the Mayor disapproves shall be returned to the
City Council, with the Mayor’s written objections, at the next regular meeting
of the City Council occurring not less than five (5) days after their passage.
The Mayor may disapprove of any one or more sums appropriated in any ordinance,
resolution, or motion making an appropriation, and, if so, the remainder shall
be effective. However, the Mayor may disapprove entirely of an ordinance,
resolution, or motion making an appropriation. If the Mayor fails to return any
ordinance or any specified resolution or motion with his written objections,
within the designated time, it shall become effective despite the absence of
the Mayor’s signature.
(2006 Code § 1-2-14)
   E.   Reconsideration; Passing Over Veto: Every resolution and motion
specified in subsection D of this section and every ordinance that is returned
to the City Council by the Mayor shall be reconsidered by the City Council at
the next regular meeting following the regular meeting at which the City
Council receives the Mayor’s written objection. If, after reconsideration, two-
thirds (2/3) of all the Aldermen then holding office on the City Council agree
at that regular meeting to pass an ordinance, resolution, or motion,
notwithstanding the Mayor’s refusal to approve it, then it shall be effective.
The vote on the question of passage over the Mayor's veto shall be by yeas and
nays, and shall be recorded in the journal.
(2006 Code § 1-2-15)
   F.   Reconsideration At Special Meeting: No vote of the City Council shall
be reconsidered or rescinded at a special meeting unless there are present at
the special meeting at least as many Aldermen as were present when the vote was
taken.
(2006 Code § 1-2-16)

be responsible for the actual charges.
   B.   Waivers Or Reductions: Documents shall be furnished without charge or

locations than the office having charge of the requested records.

specified records.
         c.   The request is couched in categorical terms and requires an
extensive search for the records responsive to it.
         d.   The requested records require examination and evaluation by
personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they
are exempt from disclosure under the terms of the Illinois Freedom of
Information Act or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions.

Clerk shall notify the person making the request, by letter, within the time
limits specified in this subsection, of the reasons for the delay and the date

   A.   Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be
complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for
the City, there is no method of narrowing the request, and the burden on the
City strongly outweighs the public interest in the information. If the City
responds to a categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly
burden its operation, it shall do so in writing signed by the Clerk specifying
the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which
compliance will so burden the operation of the City.
   B.   After receipt of this response in writing, the person making the
request shall have an opportunity to reduce the request to manageable
proportions. If the person making the request fails to reduce the request to
manageable proportions, the response of the City shall be treated as a denial
of the request information.
(2006 Code § 15-1-9)
1-12-9:   EXEMPTIONS FROM INSPECTION AND COPYING:
Information exempted by 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes ILCS 140/7 of the Freedom

working days of receipt thereof. Failure to respond shall be considered a

Illinois Compiled Statutes 140/11 of the Freedom of Information Act.
(2006 Code § 15-1-11)

Allegations
1-14-5:   Consequences Of A Violation Of The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-14-6:   Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report
1-14-1:   PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations, it is a policy of the City to prohibit harassment of any person
by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal
agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials,
municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are
prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment
relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. 687, 1-16-2018)
1-14-2:   DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as any
unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a
sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual’s employment;
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   B.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      1.   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature;
      2.   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking”
or “kissing” noises;
      3.   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
      4.   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing
the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault; and
      5.   Textual/electronic: “sexting” (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
   C.   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
(Ord. 687, 1-16-2018)
1-14-3:   PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating his position to the
offending employee, and his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for
sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   B.   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      1.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal, if subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      2.   Contact With Supervisory Personnel:
         a.   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the City Manager or Administrator, or the Chief Executive Officer of
the municipality.
         b.   The employee experiencing what he believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      3.   Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this chapter is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint
with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days.
   C.   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   D.   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.

1-14-4:   PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
chapter;
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this chapter.
   B.   For the purposes of this chapter, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee; or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may
not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he has opposed that which he reasonably and
in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he has
made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed
over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge due within one hundred eighty (180) days (IDHR) or three
hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 687, 1-16-2018)
1-14-5:   CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this chapter or the
prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per offense, applicable
discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and
penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or Federal law.
Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
State or Federal agency.
(Ord. 687, 1-16-2018)
1-14-6:   CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
   A.   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining.
   B.   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging
a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State’s
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor, An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior

date of filing the application. Except for the amount of tax and interest due
under this section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application

before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which
case, the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax
Administrator, whichever is longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this

amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. GROSS CHARGES for
private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination
point within the City and charges for the portion of the interoffice channels
provided within the City. Charges for that portion of the interoffice channel
connecting two (2) or more channel termination points, one or more of which is
located within the jurisdictional boundary of the City, shall be determined by
the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the
interoffice channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary
of the City and the denominator of which is the total number of channel
termination points connected by the interoffice channel. However, GROSS CHARGE
shall not include any of the following:
   A.   Any amounts added to a purchaser’s bill because of a charge made
pursuant to:
      1.   The tax imposed by this article;
      2.   The tax imposed by the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act (35 ILCS
630/1 et seq.);
      3.   The tax imposed by section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      4.   911 surcharges; or
      5.   Charges added to customers’ bills pursuant to the provisions of
section 9-221 or 9-222 of the Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/9-221 or 9-
222.2), as amended, or any similar charges added to customers’ bills by
retailers who are not subject to rate regulation by the Illinois Commerce
Commission for the purpose of recovering any of the tax liabilities or other
amounts specified in those provisions of the Public Utilities Act.
   B.   Charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside the City.
   C.   Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data

   F.   Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided
in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under
this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that
the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or
between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service.
   G.   Bad debts (“bad debt” means any portion of a debt that is related to a
sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable Federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made).
   H.   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin operated telecommunications
devices.
   I.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act (35 ILCS 635/1 et seq.)
   J.   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if:
      1.   Those charges are aggregated with other charges for
telecommunications that are taxable;
      2.   Those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice; and
      3.   The retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on the
retailer’s books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate or
terminate outside this State.
INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that originate and
terminate within this State.

application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer
not maintaining a place of business within this State, who, to the satisfaction
of the department, furnishes adequate security to ensure collection and payment
of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect
such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect
the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this State in
the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining
a place of business within this State. The permit may be revoked by the
department at its discretion.
RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE Or Any Like Term: Means
and includes any retailer having or maintaining within the State, directly or
by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities,

SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event, this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, SERVICE ADDRESS means the customer’s place of primary use as defined
in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air to ground
systems and the like, SERVICE ADDRESS shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, private line means a
dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the
customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of
channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified
locations. The definition of TELECOMMUNICATIONS shall not include value added
services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form,
content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than
transmission. TELECOMMUNICATIONS shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter
company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered TELECOMMUNICATIONS
subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this definition,
“prepaid telephone calling arrangements” means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act (35 ILCS 120/2-27).

that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall

subsection to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the
municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the City or receiving in the
City interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of five percent (5%)

remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the State. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.

show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made tax free on the
ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number
from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection
with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable
because of being a sale for resale.

3-8-1:   PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND RATIONALE:
   A.   Purpose: It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general
welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses within the City. The provisions of this chapter have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or
reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to
restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by
the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene material.
   B.   Findings And Rationale: Based on evidence of the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to
the City Council, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions
incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C., 124
S.Ct. 2219 (June 7, 2004); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S.
425 (2002); Pap’s A.M. v. City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426
U.S. 50 (1976), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); California
v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); and based upon reports concerning secondary
effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but
not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden
Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979,
1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980; Los
Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington -
2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003;
Amarillo, Texas - 1977; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the report
of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented
Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the City Council finds:
      1.   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of
disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter, and
sexual assault and exploitation.
      2.   Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land
uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and
should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses to minimize the
secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary
concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area.
      3.   Each of the foregoing secondary effects constitutes a harm which the
City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This
substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the
City's rationale of this chapter, exists independent of any comparative
analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses.
Additionally, the City’s interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses
extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future
sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the City. The City Council
finds that the cases and information relied on in formulating this chapter are
reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

regulations of this chapter, during those times when the sexually oriented
business is occupied by patrons or is open to the public. This section shall be
narrowly construed by the City to authorize reasonable inspections of the
licensed premises pursuant to this chapter, but not to authorize a harassing or
excessive pattern of inspections. The provisions of this section do not apply

      2.   The City shall issue written intent to revoke a sexually oriented
business license or a sexually oriented business employee license, as

      3.   The fact that any relevant conviction is being appealed shall have
no effect on the revocation of the license; provided, that if any conviction
which serves as a basis of a license revocation is overturned or reversed on
appeal, that conviction shall be treated as null and of no effect for
revocation purposes.
      4.   When, after the notice and hearing procedure described in section 3-
8-17 of this chapter, the City Council revokes a license, the revocation shall
continue for one year, and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually oriented
business license or sexually oriented business employee license for one year
from the date revocation becomes effective.
(2006 Code § 7-6-10)
3-8-17:   HEARING ON DENIAL, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE; APPEALS:

revoke a license, the Mayor shall immediately send such notice, which shall
include the specific grounds under this chapter for such action, to the
applicant or licensee (respondent) by personal delivery or certified mail. The
notice shall be directed to the most current business address or other mailing
address on file with the Mayor for the respondent. The notice shall specify a
date, not less than ten (10) days nor more than twenty (20) days after the date
the notice is issued, on which the City Council shall conduct a hearing on the
Mayor’s intent to deny, suspend, or revoke the license.
   B.   At the hearing, the respondent shall have the opportunity to prevent
all of respondent's arguments and to be represented by counsel, present
evidence and witnesses on his or her behalf, and cross examine any of the
Mayor’s witnesses. The Mayor shall also be represented by counsel and shall
bear the burden of proving the grounds for denying, suspending, or revoking the
license. The hearing shall take no longer than two (2) days, unless extended at

decision, including specific reasons for the decision pursuant to this chapter,
to the respondent within five (5) days after the hearing.

decision shall not become effective until the thirtieth day after it is
rendered, and the decision shall include a statement advising the respondent of
the right to appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction. If the
City Council’s decision finds that no grounds exist for denial, suspension, or
revocation of the license, the City Council shall, contemporaneously with the
issuance of the decision, order the Mayor to immediately withdraw the intent to
deny, suspend, or revoke the license and to notify the respondent in writing by
certified mail of such action. If the respondent is not yet licensed, the Mayor
shall contemporaneously therewith issue the license to the applicant.

briefing and/or disposition of the action, shall comply with any expedited
schedule set by the court, and shall facilitate prompt judicial review of the
proceedings. The following shall apply to any sexually oriented business that
is in operation as of the effective date hereof: Upon the filing of any court
action to appeal, challenge, restrain, or otherwise enjoin the City’s
enforcement of the denial, suspension, or revocation, the City shall
immediately issue the respondent a provisional license. The provisional license
shall allow the respondent to continue operation of the sexually oriented
business or to continue employment as a sexually oriented business employee and
will expire upon the court’s entry of a judgment on the respondent’s appeal or
other action to restrain or otherwise enjoin the City’s enforcement.
(2006 Code § 7-6-11)
3-8-18:   PROVING VIOLATION OR BUSINESS LICENSEE LIABILITY:
This chapter does not impose strict liability. Unless a culpable mental state
is otherwise specified herein, a showing of a knowing or reckless mental state
is necessary to establish a violation of a provision of this chapter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the purposes of this chapter, an
act by an employee that constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of
that employee's license shall be imputed to the sexually oriented business
license for purposes of finding a violation of this chapter, or for purposes of
license denial, suspension, or revocation, only if an officer, director, or
general partner, or a person who managed, supervised, or controlled the
operation of the business premises, knowingly or recklessly allowed such act to
occur on the premises. It shall be a defense to liability that the person to
whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent the act.
(2006 Code § 7-6-19)
3-8-19:   FAILURE OF CITY TO MEET DEADLINES:
In the event that a City official is required to take an action or do a thing
pursuant to this chapter within a prescribed time, and fails to take such
action or do such thing within the time prescribed, said failure shall not
prevent the exercise of constitutional rights of an applicant or licensee. If
the act required of the City official under this chapter, and not completed in
the time prescribed, includes approval of condition(s) necessary for approval
by the City of an applicant’s or licensee's application for a sexually oriented
business license or a sexually oriented business employee’s license (including
a renewal), the license shall be deemed granted and the business or employee
allowed to commence operations or employment the day after the deadline for the
City’s action has passed.
(2006 Code § 7-6-20)
3-8-20:   APPLICATION TO EXISTING BUSINESSES:
All existing sexually oriented businesses and sexually oriented business
employees are hereby granted a de facto temporary license to continue operation
or employment for a period of ninety (90) days following the effective date
hereof. By the end of said ninety (90) days, all sexually oriented businesses
and sexually oriented business employees must conform to and abide by the
requirements of this chapter.
(2006 Code § 7-6-17)
3-8-21:   PENALTIES AND ENFORCEMENT:

to comply with or resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be guilty of an ordinance violation and, upon conviction, shall
be punishable by a fine not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00).
Each day a violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a
separate offense and the violator shall be fined as such.
   B.   The City’s legal counsel is hereby authorized to institute civil
proceedings necessary for the enforcement of this chapter to prosecute,
restrain, or correct violations hereof. Such proceedings, including injunction,
shall be brought in the name of the City; provided, however, that nothing in
this section and no action taken hereunder, shall be held to exclude such
criminal or administrative proceedings as may be authorized by other provisions
of this chapter or any of the laws or ordinances in force in the City or to
exempt anyone violating this chapter or any part of the said laws from any
penalty which may be incurred.

or in a neighboring municipality of atomic or other means from without, or by
means of sabotage or other disloyal actions within, or from fire, flood,
earthquake, or other natural or manmade causes, and in order to ensure that the

great, and the Governor has proclaimed the City a disaster, he may make
application for funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund. If monies available
from the fund are insufficient, and if the Mayor finds that other sources of

   D.   Duty To Reduce Speed: A vehicle shall be driven upon the streets and
alleys of the City at a speed which is reasonable and proper with regard to

vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the
driver of the duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an
intersection or when special hazard exists with respect to pedestrian or other
traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be decreased
as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or
entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all

of the permit, unless the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this
period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or
by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty
(360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void
unless the City grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

      2.   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
City.
(2006 Code § 31-6-8)
   D.   Advisory Report: Within a reasonable time after the public hearing, the
Zoning Board shall submit an advisory report on the requested variance to the
City Council. Their advisory report shall be responsive to all of the variance
standards set forth in subsection F of this section.
(2006 Code § 31-6-9)
   E.   Decision By City Council: The City Council shall act on every request
for a street graphic variance at their next regularly scheduled meeting
following submission of the Zoning Board's advisory report. The City Council
may grant a street graphic variance by an ordinance passed by simple majority
vote of all the members then holding office. In a separate statement
accompanying any such ordinance, the City Council shall state their findings of
fact, and indicate their reasons for granting or denying the requested
variance.
(2006 Code § 31-6-10)
   F.   Standards For Granting Variances: The City Council shall not grant any
street graphic variance unless, based upon the evidence presented to them, they
determine that:
      1.   The proposed variance is consistent with the spirit and purpose of
this chapter, and will not cause injury to the area in which the street graphic
is/will be located or be detrimental to the public welfare in any way; and
      2.   Strict application of the requirements of this chapter would result
in great practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant; and
      3.   The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from such
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship while protecting the
broader public interest; and
      4.   The plight of the applicant is due to peculiar circumstances not of
his own making; and
      5.   In cases involving “areas of special control,” granting the proposed
variance will not result in the maintenance or erection of a street graphic
that is inharmonious with the special characteristics of such area; and
      6.   The peculiar circumstances engendering the variance request are not
applicable to other street graphics in the vicinity, and therefore, a variance
would be a more appropriate remedy than an amendment.
(2006 Code § 31-6-11)
8-11E-3:   AMENDMENTS:
   A.   Proposed Amendments: The City Council may amend this chapter in
accordance with the provisions of this section. Amendments may be proposed by

   B.   Filing: Every proposal to amend this chapter shall be filed with the
Administrator on a prescribed form. The Administrator shall promptly transmit
said proposal, together with any comments or recommendation he may wish to
make, to the Zoning Board for a public hearing.
(2006 Code § 31-6-14)
   C.   Public Hearing; Notice: The Zoning Board shall hold a public hearing on
every amendment proposal within a reasonable time after said proposal has been
submitted to them. At the hearing, any interested party may appear and testify,
either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. Notice indicating the
time, date, and place of the hearing and the nature of the proposed amendment
shall be given not more than thirty (30) nor less than fifteen (15) days before
the hearing:
      1.   By first class mail to all parties whose property would be directly
affected by the proposed amendment; and
      2.   By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
City.
(2006 Code § 31-6-15)
   D.   Advisory Report; Action By City Council: Within a reasonable time after
the public hearing, the Zoning Board shall submit their advisory report to the
City Council. The City Council shall act on every proposed amendment at their
next regularly scheduled meeting following submission of said report. Without
further public hearing, the City Council, by simple majority vote of all the
members then holding office, may either pass the proposed amendment or refer it
back to the Zoning Board for further consideration.

8-12-1:   FINDINGS:
The City Council hereby finds that:
   A.   The soil types found in the City are susceptible to erosion and if left
unprotected could cause severe loss of soil with resultant damage to property;
   B.   The topography of the City contains areas with steep slopes upon which,
if clearing of trees and/or inappropriate construction takes place, could
result in severe erosion and slope stability problems which could result in
damage to property;
   C.   Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain nonagricultural uses including, but not limited to, the
construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the
building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and
drainageways, and the creation of recreational facilities;
   D.   The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision
and reducing traction of road vehicles;
   E.   Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed out
fills, and embankments;
   F.   Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to
pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs;
   G.   Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and
other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and
   H.   Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage
capacity of floodplains and natural depressions, resulting in increased chances
of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
(2006 Code § 32-1-1)
8-12-2:   PURPOSE:
The City Council, therefore, declares that the purpose of this chapter is to
safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment, and
promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design,
construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity which
disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on
land situated in the City. It is the intention of this chapter that the
delivery of sediment from sites affected by land disturbing activities be
limited, as closely as practicable, to that which would have occurred if the
land had been left in its natural undisturbed state.
(2006 Code § 32-1-2)

in saturated soil conditions.
(2006 Code § 32-2-1)
8-12-4:   PRINCIPLES FOR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES:
It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation
caused by development activities, including clearing, grading, stripping,
excavating, and filling of land, in the City. Measures taken to control soil
erosion and off site sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment
is not transported from the site by a storm event of 10-year frequency or less.
The following principles shall apply to all development activities within the
City and to the preparation of the submissions required under section
8-12-5 of this chapter:
   A.   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site
so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where
high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided where possible, and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   B.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and wetlands
should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of
watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures.
   C.   Special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from
any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake,
pond, or wetland. Preventive measures should reflect the sensitivity of these
areas to erosion and sedimentation.
   D.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   E.   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other
appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
from land undergoing development.
   F.   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be
based on assessment of the probable frequency or climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs, and
benefits involved.
   G.   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   H.   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
and rates of discharges will not create additional erosion on site or
downstream.
   I.   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional
as soon as practical during development.
   J.   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land
uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
   K.   All waste generated as a result of site development activity should be
properly disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by
either wind or water.
   L.   All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from
being tracked onto public or private roadways.
   M.   All downspouts from structures shall be connected to or shall direct
drainage to the approved storm drainage system.
(2006 Code § 32-3-1)
8-12-5:   SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Permit Required: Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no
person shall commence or perform any clearing, grading, stripping, excavating,
or filling of land which meets the following provisions without having first
obtained a site development permit from the Building and Zoning Administrator
of the City.
      1.   Any land disturbing activity (i.e., clearing, grading, stripping,
excavation, fill, or any combination thereof) that will affect an area in

water flow to tributary and downstream lands, and comprehensive watershed
management plans, or the use of any retention facilities; possible saturation
of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; runoff
surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainageways; nature and
type of soil or rock which, when disturbed by the proposed development
activities, may create earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be
landscaped; and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape
through grading or removal of vegetation.
(2006 Code § 32-4-8)
   I.   Retention Of Plans: Plans, specifications, and reports for all site
developments shall be retained in original form by the Building and Zoning
Administrator.
(2006 Code § 32-4-9)
8-12-6:   DESIGN AND OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Applicability: All clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and
filling which is subject to the permit requirements of this chapter shall be
subject to the application standards and requirements set forth in this
section.
(2006 Code § 32-5-1)
   B.   Responsibility: The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility
for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, and the City or its
officers or agents will not be made liable for such damage by:
      1.   The issuance of a permit under this chapter;
      2.   Compliance with the provisions of that permit or with conditions
attached to it by the Building and Zoning Administrator;
      3.   Failure of City officials to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions;
      4.   Failure of City officials to recommend denial or to deny a permit;
or
      5.   Exemptions from the permit requirements of this chapter.
(2006 Code § 32-5-2)
   C.   Single Lot Site Design Requirements:
      1.   On site sediment control measures shall be constructed and
functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, or
fill activities on the site.
      2.   Control measures shall be constructed to control runoff from the
property to such an extent possible that sediment is retained on site. The
applicant may select one or more of the control measures as shown in the Office
of Building and Zoning.
         a.   For minimally sloping lots (slopes less than 8 percent) or areas
with limited disturbance must select control measures as shown in the Office of
Building and Zoning.
         b.   For moderately sloping lots (slopes between 8 percent and 20
percent), select control measures both in the Office of Building and Zoning.
      3.   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent
measures within seven (7) calendar days following the end of active
disturbance, or redisturbance consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or nonvegetative measures.
         b.   Areas having slopes greater than twelve percent (12%) shall be
stabilized with sod, mat, or blanket in combination with seeding or equivalent.
      4.   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices
must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of
their intended function.
      5.   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
disposed of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved
with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
      6.   On site sediment control measures, as specified by the following
criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing,
grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site:
         a.   For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers
(including filter fences, straw bales, or equivalent control measures) shall be
constructed to control all off site runoff as specified in referenced
handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty five feet
(25'), may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is
expected.
         b.   For disturbed areas draining more than one but less than five (5)
acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at
the downslope point of the disturbed area.
         c.   For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment
basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point
of the disturbed area.
         d.   Sediment basins and sediment traps designs shall provide for both
detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed
of equal volumes of “wet” detention storage and “dry” detention storage, and
each shall be sized for the 2-year, 24-hour runoff from the site under maximum
runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the basin shall be
that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten (10)
hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only
drains the dry detention storage.
         e.    The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated
sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction
period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume or sediment generated in
one year. For construction periods exceeding one year, the 1-year sediment load
and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted.
      7.   Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and
diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the 10-year frequency
storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized
within forty eight (48) hours, consistent with the following standards:
         a.   For grades up to four percent (4%), seeding in combination with
mulch, erosion blanket, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod
or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel.
         b.   For grades of four percent (4%) to eight percent (8%), sod or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied in the channel.
         c.   For grades greater than eight percent (8%), rock, riprap, or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively
reduced using drop structures.
      8.   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent
measures within seven (7) calendar days following the end of active
disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or nonvegetative measures.
         b.   Areas having slopes greater than twelve percent (12%) shall be
stabilized with sod, mat, or blanket in combination with seeding, or
equivalent.
      9.   Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided
where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following
requirements shall be met:
         a.   Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to
the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary,
temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap
or gravel.
         b.   The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept
to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be stabilized
within forty eight (48) hours after channel disturbance is completed,
interrupted, or stopped.
         c.   Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall
be constructed in the dry and fully stabilized before flow is diverted.
      10.   Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment
traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications.
      11.   Soil storage piles containing more than ten (10) cubic yards of
material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than
twenty five feet (25') to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers,
including straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be installed
immediately on the downslope side of the piles.
      12.   If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be
protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through
appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent.
      13.   Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads,
access drives, and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent
sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment
reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street
cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a
controlled sediment disposal area.
      14.   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices
must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of
their intended function.
      15.   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
disposed of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved
with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
(2006 Code § 32-5-3)
   D.   Handbook Adopted By Reference: The standards and specifications
contained in “Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control” (the Yellow Book) and the "Illinois Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control" (the Green Book) cited in subsection 8-
12-5D2d(2) of this chapter are hereby incorporated into this section and made a
part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods
of operation under site development and erosion and sedimentation control plans
approved under section
8-12-5 of this chapter. In the event of conflict between provisions of said
manuals and of this chapter, this chapter shall govern.
(2006 Code § 32-5-4)
   E.   Maintenance Of Control Measures: All soil erosion and sediment control
measures necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter shall be maintained
periodically by the applicant or subsequent land owner during the period of
land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure
adequate performance.
(2006 Code § 32-5-5)
   F.   Inspections:
      1.   The Building and Zoning Administrator shall make inspections as
hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work
completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with
the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan. Plans for
grading, stripping, excavating, and filling work bearing the stamp of approval
of the Building and Zoning Administrator shall be maintained at the site during
progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections and to ensure compliance
with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, the grading or building
permit, and this chapter, the permittee shall notify the Building and Zoning
Administrator within two (2) working days of the completion of the construction
stages specified below:
         a.   Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control
measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding
with any other earth disturbance or grading;
         b.   After stripping and clearing;
         c.   After rough grading;
         d.   After final grading;
         e.   After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and
         f.   After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of
sediment controls.
      2.   If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in
phases or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the
completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area. If an
inspection is not made and notification of the results given within five (5)
working days after notice is received by the City from the permittee, the
permittee may continue work at his/her own risk, without presuming acceptance
by the City. Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in
writing at the site.
(2006 Code § 32-5-6)
   G.   Special Precautions:
      1.   If at any stage of the grading of any development site the Building
and Zoning Administrator determines by inspection that the nature of the site
is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil
any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the
Building and Zoning Administrator may require, as a condition of allowing the
work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions be taken as is
considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. “Special
precautions” may include, but shall not be limited to, a more level exposed
slope; construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing,
compaction, or cribbing; installation of plant materials for erosion control;
and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering geologist
which may be made requirements for further work.
      2.   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on
any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee
required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the Building and Zoning
Administrator may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion
or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to
ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of
seasonal rains.
(2006 Code § 32-5-7)
   H.   Amendments Of Plans: Major amendments of the site development or
erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the Building and
Zoning Administrator and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the
same manner as the original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be
authorized by the Building and Zoning Administrator by written authorization to
the permittee.
(2006 Code § 32-5-8)
8-12-7:   ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Exceptions: The Board of Appeals may, in accordance with the following
procedures, authorize exceptions to any of the requirements and regulations set
forth in this chapter:
      1.   Application for any exception shall be made by a verified petition
of the applicant for a site development permit, stating fully the grounds of
the petition and the facts relied upon by the applicant. Such petition shall be
filed with the site development permit application. In order for a petition to
be granted, it shall be necessary that the Board of Appeals find all of the
following facts with respect to the land referred to in the petition:
         a.   That the land is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations of record that it
is impossible or impracticable for the applicant to comply with all of the
requirements of this chapter;
         b.   That the exception is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; and
         c.   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject
property.
      2.   Each application for an exception shall be referred to the Building
and Zoning Administrator for review. The officer shall transmit his
recommendations to the Board of Appeals, which shall review such
recommendations prior to granting or denying the exception.
      3.   The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on each application
for exception, within thirty (30) days after receiving the application, in the
manner provided with respect to appeals. After public hearing, the Board may
approve the site development permit application with the exceptions and
conditions it deems necessary, or it may disapprove such site development
permit application and exception application, or it may take such other action
as appropriate.
(2006 Code § 32-6-1)
   B.   Suspension Or Revocation Of Permit:

   A.   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the
City by the Illinois Compiled Statutes.
   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to diminish threats to public health,
safety, and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new
development and redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the
inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of
downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources.
The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of
quality is the development and improvement of land and as such, this chapter
regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts.
   C.   This chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives:
      1.   To assure that new development does not increase the drainage or
flood hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
      2.   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff;

incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants. Retention
of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property’s drainage system to
reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff
pollutants.
   B.   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable.
Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open space,
aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing fields),
wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid using
portions of the property exclusively for stormwater management.
(2006 Code § 33-1-6)
8-13-7:   DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS AND METHODS:
   A.   Release Rates: The drainage system for a property shall be designed to
control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the 10-year, 24-hour
and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels which will not cause an increase in
flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with
other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities in basins less
than twenty (20) acres, the modified rational method of design as specified in
the IDOT drainage manual may be used to calculate release rates.
Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage system shall be
evaluated when designing the outlet.
   B.   Detention Storage Requirements: The design maximum storage to be
provided in the detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year,
24-hour event and reservoir (also called a modified pool or level pool) routing
or equal. Detention storage for basins less than twenty (20) acres shall be
computed using the rational method. Detention storage for basins greater than
twenty (20) acres shall be computed using hydrograph methods.
   C.   Drainage System Design And Evaluation: The following criteria should be
used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective
is to provide capacity to pass the 10-year peak flow in the minor drainage
system and an overload flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity.
      1.   Design Methodologies: Major and minor conveyance systems for areas
up to twenty (20) acres may be designed using the rational formula. The
rational formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for
larger sites. Runoff hydrograph methods as described in subsection D of this
section must be used for major drainage system design for all systems with
greater than twenty (20) acres of drainage area and for the design of all
detention basins.
      2.   Positive Drainage: Whenever practicable, all areas of the property
must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a
stage at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity
of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the
minor drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street
ponding and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch
(1").
   D.   Methods For Generating Runoff Hydrographs: Runoff hydrographs shall be
developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and
antecedent moisture:
      1.   Rainfall: Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system
hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois
State Water Survey’s Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall
distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems
with critical durations less than or equal to twelve (12) hours. The third
quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis
of detention basins and conveyance systems with critical durations greater than
twelve (12) and less than or equal to twenty four (24) hours. The fourth
quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with
durations greater than twenty four (24) hours. The first, third, and fourth
quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in Table 37 of Bulletin
70. The SCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff
distributions.
      2.   Antecedent Moisture: Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not
rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume
a conservative wet antecedent moisture condition as a minimum.
   E.   Wet Detention Basin Design: Wet detention basins shall be designed to
remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and, as
much as feasible, to be available for recreational use.
      1.   Wet Basin Depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet (3') deep,
excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be
provided, it shall be at least six feet (6') deep over twenty five percent
(25%) of the bottom area to prevent winter freezeout.
      2.   Wet Basin Shoreline Slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the
normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than three to one (3:1 horizontal to
vertical).
      3.   Permanent Pool Volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the 2-
year event.
      4.   Inlet And Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance
between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they
should be at opposite ends of the basin.
   F.   Dry Detention Basin Design: In addition to the other requirements of
this chapter, dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to
be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and, as much as feasible, to be available
for multiple uses.
      1.   Dry Basin Drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that eighty
percent (80%) of their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than
seventy two (72) hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event.
Underdrains directed to the outlet control shall be used if necessary to
accomplish this requirement.
      2.   Velocity Dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets
and to minimize resuspension of pollutants.
      3.   Inlet And Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance
between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they
should be at opposite ends of the basin.
   G.   Minimum Detention Outlet Size: Where a single pipe outlet or orifice
plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of
four inches (4"). If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater
than those specified in this section, and regional detention is not a practical
alternative, alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which incorporate
self-cleaning flow restrictions.
   H.   Detention In Floodplains: The placement of detention basins within the
floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable
operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention requirements
of this chapter may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood
fringe areas on the project site, provided the following provisions are met:
      1.   Detention In Flood Fringe Areas: The placement of a detention basin
in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for one and one-half
(1-1/2) times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the
detention basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage
provided shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this
section. The applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all stream flow and
floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along
watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention.
All floodplain storage lost below the 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced
below the existing 10-year elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the
existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year
flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to
drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
      2.   Detention In Floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the
floodway only in accordance with subsection H3 of this section.
      3.   On Stream Detention: On stream detention basins are discouraged but
allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other
provisions of this chapter with respect to water quality and control of the 2-
year and 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are
presented in section
8-13-8 of this chapter. If on stream detention is used in watersheds larger
than one square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic modeling
to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties
upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part
of on stream detention:
         a.   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which
require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
         b.   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality
or stream aquatic habitat;
         c.   Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a presedimentation basin;
         d.   Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of
wetlands;
         e.   Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source
management program throughout the upstream watershed; and
         f.   Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge.
   I.   Drainage Into Wetlands: Wetlands shall be protected from damaging
modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated
with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter,
the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage
flows into wetlands:
      1.   Detention In Wetlands: Existing wetlands shall not be modified for
the purposes of stormwater detention unless it is demonstrated that the
existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed modifications will maintain
or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions. Existing
depressional storage in wetlands shall be maintained and the volume of
detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be in
addition to this existing storage.
      2.   Sediment Control: The existing wetlands shall be protected during
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and
shall not be filled.
      3.   Alteration Of Drainage Patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be
altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to
the wetland.
      4.   Detention/Sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be
routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture
the 2-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least twenty four (24) hours,
before being discharged to the wetland. This basin shall be constructed before
property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in Section
8-13-5 of this chapter should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates
being discharged to the wetland.
      5.   Vegetated Buffer Strip: A buffer strip of at least twenty five feet
(25') in width, preferably vegetated with native plant species, shall be
maintained or restored around the periphery of the wetland.
   J.   Street, Parking Lot And Culvert Drainage:
      1.   Streets: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major
drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one
inch (1") and shall not remain flooded for more than eight (8) hours for any
event less than or equal to the 100-year event.
      2.   Parking Lots: The maximum stormwater ponding depth in any parking
area shall not exceed six inches (6") for more than four (4) hours.
      3.   Culvert, Road And Driveway Crossings: Sizing of culvert crossings
shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tail water conditions on the
culvert.
   K.   Safety Considerations: The drainage system components, especially all
detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or
adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events.
      1.   Side Slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year
capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the
basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention
basins and open channels shall not be steeper than three to one (3:1)
(horizontal to vertical).
      2.   Safety Ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety
ledge at least four feet (4') in width two and one-half feet (2-1/2') to three
feet (3') below the normal water depth.
      3.   Velocity: Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be
controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of flow.
      4.   Overflow Structures: All stormwater detention basins shall be
provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a
stage at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity
of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structures shall
be equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate.
   L.   Maintenance Considerations: The stormwater drainage system shall be
designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes shall be
designed to allow lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins
shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain
the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by
gravity is not feasible). Presedimentation basins shall be included, where
feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy
equipment shall be provided.
(2006 Code § 33-1-7)
8-13-8:   ACCOMMODATING FLOWS FROM UPSTREAM TRIBUTARY AREAS:
Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in
the design of the property’s drainage system. Whenever practicable, flows from
upstream areas that are not to be detained should be routed around the basin
being provided for the site being developed.
   A.   Upstream Areas Not Meeting Requirements:
      1.   When there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of
this chapter, tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized detention on
the applicant’s property shall be explored by the applicant. The following
steps shall be followed:
         a.   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his
property using the release rates of section
8-13-6 of this chapter, the applicant's property area, and the procedures
described in section
8-13-7 of this chapter.
         b.   Areas tributary to the applicant's property not meeting the
storage and release rate requirements of this chapter shall be identified.
         c.   Using the areas determined in subsection A1b of this section,
plus the applicant's property area, total storage needed for the combined
properties shall be computed.
      2.   Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined
property areas. Storage shall be computed as described in section
8-13-7 of this chapter. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable
fully developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be assumed for the
purposes of computing storage.
      3.   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the City may choose
to pay for oversizing the applicant’s detention basin to accommodate the
regional flows. The applicant’s responsibility will be limited to the storage
for his property as computed above. If regional storage is selected by the
City, then the design produced in subsection A1c of this section shall be
implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the City, the applicant shall
bypass all tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever
practicable. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his basin and
the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size, the applicant must meet the
provision of subsection
8-13-7H3 of this chapter for on stream basins.
   B.   Upstream Areas Meeting Code Requirements: When there are areas which
meet the storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, tributary to
the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around the
applicant’s detention basin if this is the only practicable alternative.
Storage needed for the applicant’s property shall be computed as described in
subsection A1a of this section. However, if the City decides to route tributary
area flows through an applicant's basin, the final design stormwater releases
shall be based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary
areas. It must be shown that at no time will the release rate from the combined
property exceed the allowable release rate for the applicant’s property alone.
(2006 Code § 33-1-8)
8-13-9:   EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES:
Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as
part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the
first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in
these facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in
order to maintain the design volume of the facilities.
(2006 Code § 33-1-9)
8-13-10:   FEE IN LIEU OF DETENTION:
   A.   All single-family residential developments under five (5) acres in size
and all other developments under one acre in size shall pay a fee of ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each acre-foot of detention which would be
required under this chapter rather than installing detention facilities on the
property, unless specifically directed to do otherwise by the appropriate local
official. The City also shall have the option for larger properties of
requiring a fee of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each acre-foot of
detention needed in lieu of the applicant building a basin on site, provided
the property will discharge stormwater to the City’s storm sewer system.
   B.   In instances where regional benefits and economies of scale can be
achieved, it will be permissible for adjacent properties to utilize a common
regional detention basin. Applicants shall have the option of paying a fee of
ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for each acre-foot of detention required so
that the City can build regional facilities or they can jointly build the
necessary facilities themselves.
(2006 Code § 33-1-10)
8-13-11:   MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY:
Maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities located on private property shall
be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before an appropriate
permit is obtained from the City, the applicant shall execute a maintenance
agreement with the City guaranteeing that the applicant and all future owners
of the property will maintain its stormwater drainage system. Such agreement
shall be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of the County. The maintenance
agreement shall include a schedule for regular maintenance of each aspect of
the property’s stormwater drainage system and shall provide for access to the
system for inspection by authorized personnel of the City. The maintenance
agreement shall also stipulate that if the appropriate personnel of the City
notify the property owner in writing of maintenance problems which require
correction, the property owner shall make such corrections within thirty (30)
calendar days of such notification. If the corrections are not made within this

   C.   Upon receipt of an application for development permit, the Building and
Zoning Administrator shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by survey data to
be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has not been filled
after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map is not in the
floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood
elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current Flood
Insurance Rate Map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   D.   The Building and Zoning Administrator shall maintain documentation of
the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood
Insurance Rate Map identification.

   C.   The Building and Zoning Administrator shall notify an applicant in
writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protection
standards of section
8-14-7 of this chapter would lessen the degree of protection to a building
which will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   D.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
8-14-7 of this chapter requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair,
or alteration of a historic site or historic structure, as defined in
8-14-2, HISTORIC STRUCTURES, of this chapter, may be granted using criteria
more permissive than the requirements of sections
8-14-6  and
8-14-7  of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
(2006 Code § 14-1-11)
8-14-12:   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully hereunder.
(2006 Code § 14-1-12)
8-14-13:   VIOLATION; PENALTY:
   A.   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure
to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Building and Zoning
Administrator or the City Attorney may determine that a violation of the
minimum standards of this chapter exists. The Building and Zoning Administrator
or the City Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   B.   If the owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The City shall make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense; and
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The City shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   C.   The Building and Zoning Administrator or the City Attorney shall inform
the owner that any such violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood
damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy
to be suspended.
   D.   The City is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of
the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate the
reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve
the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
   E.   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked
until a hearing is held by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Written notice of such
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation;
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present
evidence on the permittee's behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended
or revoked.
   F.   Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
(2006 Code § 14-1-13)
8-14-14:   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the City to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program including
floodplain ordinance 356. However, this chapter does not repeal the original
resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does
this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants
or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.

infrastructure. Development can occur in these areas but must meet criteria to
prevent economic or environmental damage and, in some instances, large lot
sizes will be required.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
9-3-20:   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUD):
The planned unit is intended to provide for developments incorporating a single
type or a variety of related uses which are planned and developed as a
Comprehensive Project. Such development may consist of conventionally
subdivided lots or provide for development by a single phase or multi-phased
project.
The purpose of the planned unit development is to encourage:
   A.   A wide choice in the types of living and shopping environments
available to the public by allowing a development that would not be possible
under prevailing district standards;

9-6-1:   Purpose Of Chapter
9-6-2:   Nonconforming Lots
9-6-2-1:   Residential
9-6-2-2:   Other Districts
9-6-2-3:   Two Or More Lots In Common Ownership

9-6-4:   Nonconforming Uses Occupying A Structure
9-6-5:   Nonconforming Use Of Land
9-6-6:   Nonconformities Under Permit Authority
9-6-1:   PURPOSE OF CHAPTER:
The requirements imposed by this Code are designed to guide the use of land by
encouraging the development of structures and uses that are compatible with the
predominant character of each of the various residential, business, and
industrial districts. Lots, structures, and uses of land or structures that do
not conform to the requirements of the district in which they are located
impede appropriate development. For example, nonconformities are frequently
responsible for heavy traffic on residential streets, the overtaxing of parking
facilities, the emission of noxious fumes or excessive noise, and/or the
lowering of property values. The regulations in this chapter are intended to
alleviate such existing/potential problems by encouraging the gradual
elimination of nonconformities.
(Ord. passed 8-3-2022)
9-6-2:   NONCONFORMING LOTS:
Any vacant lot, that does not conform to one or more of the lot size
requirements of the district in which it is located, may be used in the manner
indicated at sections
9-6-2-1 and
9-6-2-2 if it:
   A.   Is of record on the date of the adoption or amendment of this Code; and
   B.   Was not created after the adoption of the City of Grafton Zoning Code.
   C.   Is at least thirty feet (30') wide.
(Ord. passed 8-3-2022)
9-6-2-1:   RESIDENTIAL:
On any such lot located in any district, any permitted structures may be
erected, provided all the bulk (see definitions) and setback regulations of the
particular district are observed.
(Ord. passed 8-3-2022)
9-6-2-2:   OTHER DISTRICTS:
On any such lot located in the business or industrial districts, any structure
permitted in the particular district may be erected if the bulk and setback
requirements of that district are met.
(Ord. passed 8-3-2022)
9-6-2-3:   TWO OR MORE LOTS IN COMMON OWNERSHIP:
If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage were of record and in common ownership on the effective
date of the enactment or amendment of this Code, and if one (1) or more of
those lots does not meet the minimum lot width, depth, and area requirements of
the district in which they are located, the land involved shall be considered
an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Code. No portion of any such
parcel shall be developed except in compliance with this Code, nor shall any
such parcel be divided so as to create a lot that does not meet the
requirements of this Code.
(Ord. passed 8-3-2022)
9-6-3:   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
Any lawful structure which exists on the date of the enactment or amendment of
this Code, but which could not be erected under the terms of this Code because
of restrictions on lot size, height, setbacks, lot coverage, or other
characteristics of the structure, or its location on the lot, may lawfully
remain, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Enlargement, Alterations: No such structure shall be enlarged or
altered in any way which increases its nonconformity.
   B.   Relocation: No such structure shall be relocated unless, after
relocation, it will conform to all the regulations of the district in which it
is located.
   C.   Reconstruction: No structure which is destroyed or damaged by any means
shall be reconstructed if the Administrator determines that the cost of such
reconstruction exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the structure's market value at
the time of loss, unless after reconstruction the structure will conform to all
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event the
Administrator determines the estimated cost of reconstruction is less than
fifty percent (50%) of the structure's market value at the time of loss,
repairs or reconstruction shall be permitted, provided such work starts within
six (6) months from the date the damage occurred and is diligently pursued to
completion.
A bona fide construction contractor or adjuster shall make the reconstruction
cost estimate, and a licensed real estate appraiser shall determine the
structure's market value at the time of loss. The owner of the damaged
structure shall be responsible for transmitting these estimates to the
Administrator.
(Ord. passed 8-3-2022)
9-6-4:   NONCONFORMING USES OCCUPYING A STRUCTURE:
If any lawful use occupying a structure exists on the effective date of the
enactment or amendment of this Code, but would not be allowed under the terms
of this Code, such a use may lawfully continue, subject to the following
provisions:
   A.   Maintenance: Any structure housing a nonconforming use may be
maintained through ordinary repairs.
   B.   Enlargement, Alteration, Reconstruction, Relocation: No structure
housing a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, structurally altered,
reconstructed or relocated unless the use of the structure is changed to a
permitted use.
   C.   Extension Of Use: No nonconforming use may be extended to any part(s)
of the structure not intended or designed to be devoted to such use, nor shall
the nonconforming use be extended to occupy any land outside such structure.
   D.   Change Of Use: A nonconforming use occupying a structure shall not be
changed except to a use permitted under the applicable district regulations.
   E.   Discontinuance Of Use: When a nonconforming use of a structure, or of a
structure and premises in combination, is discontinued for twelve (12)
consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year
period, the nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed. Any
discontinuance caused by government action and without any contributing fault
by the nonconforming user shall not be counted in calculating the length of
discontinuance.
(Ord. passed 8-3-2022)
9-6-5:   NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND:
Any lawful use of land existing on the date of the adoption or amendment of
this Code that would not be permitted under the terms of this Code may lawfully
continue, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   Intensification Or Extension Of Use: A nonconforming use of land shall
not be intensified, or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied by such use on the date of the adoption or amendment of this Code.
   B.   Relocation: No nonconforming use of land shall be moved, in whole or in
part, unless, upon relocation, such use will conform to all pertinent
regulations of the district in which it will be located.
   C.   Change Of Use: A nonconforming use of land shall not be changed except
to a use that is permitted under the applicable district regulations.
   D.   Discontinuance: When a nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a
period of twelve (12) consecutive months, it shall not thereafter be resumed,
and any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the applicable district
regulations. Any discontinuance caused by government action and without any
contributing fault by the owner or operator shall not be counted in calculating
the length of discontinuance.
(Ord. passed 8-3-2022)
9-6-6:   NONCONFORMITIES UNDER PERMIT AUTHORITY:
The regulations of this chapter shall not apply to any change in an existing
structure or to any change in the use of a structure or of land for which a
permit was issued prior to enactment of this Code or any pertinent amendment
thereto, provided that the work authorized by such permit is carried out and
completed with diligence.

welfare;
   B.   To provide a pleasant living environment by furthering the orderly and
efficient layout and use of land by facilitating aesthetic urban design;

throughout the City;
   E.   To preserve the natural beauty and topography of the City to the
maximum feasible extent, including preservation of such features as stands of

   I.   To provide information to subdividers/developers and to the general
public on matters related to this title.
(2006 Code § 35-4-1)
10-3-2:   VARIANCES:
   A.   Application For Variance: Any subdivider/developer desiring a variance
from the requirements of this title shall file a written application therefor
with the Administrator at the same time that he files his preliminary plat. The
application shall fully explain the grounds for the variance request, and
specify the section(s) of this title which, if strictly applied, would cause
great practical difficulties or hardship. The Administrator shall prepare an
advisory report on every variance application and submit it, together with the
completed application, to the Board of Appeals.
(2006 Code § 35-4-2)
   B.   Review By Board Of Appeals: The Board of Appeals shall review the
variance application and the Administrator's comments, perform on site review
when appropriate, and submit their advisory report to the City Council,

preliminary and final plats. The City Council shall not grant any subdivision
variance unless, based upon the information presented to them, they determine
that:
      1.   The proposed variance is consistent with the general purposes of

accordance with approved plans.
      2.   The balance of the amount of the performance bond/escrow deposit
shall not be released by the City Clerk until:
         a.   The Administrator has certified to the City Clerk in writing that
all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed; and
         b.   Said improvements have been accepted by and dedicated to the City
or other appropriate entity.
(2006 Code § 35-3-18)
   G.   Failure To Complete Improvements: If all the required improvements have
not been completed by the end of the two (2) year period (or 3 year period, in
the case of an extension), the Administrator, with the assistance of the City
Attorney, may:
      1.   Require the surety to perform on the bond and to pay to the City an
equal amount to the cost of completing the required improvements or the amount
of the bond not theretofor released, whichever is less; or
      2.   Order the City Clerk to retain all escrow funds needed to return the
balance (if any) of such funds to the subdivider/developer; or
      3.   Require the subdivider/developer to submit a new performance bond/
escrow deposit in an amount sufficient to cover any increase in the cost of
constructing the required improvements.

   E.   Administrative Review; Advisory Report: Within thirty (30) days from
the date of application for final plat approval, the City Engineer and the
Administrator shall review said final plat (and supporting data), and shall
advise the City Council in writing whether it substantially conforms to the
approved preliminary plat and improvement plans. A copy of their advisory
report shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
may prepare an addendum to said report (should they so desire), and forward
same to the City Council.
(2006 Code § 35-3-26)
   F.   Action By City Council:
      1.   The City Council shall either approve or disapprove the application
for final plat approval by resolution within sixty (60) days from the date of
said application or the filing of the last item of required supporting data,
whichever date is later, unless the Council and the subdivider mutually agree
to extend this time limit. The City Council shall not approve any final plat
unless:
         a.   The final plat substantially conforms to the approved preliminary
plat; and
         b.   The final plat manifests substantial compliance with the design
and improvements standards of this title, the zoning title, and the Official
Map; and
         c.   To the Council's knowledge and belief, the final plat complies
with all pertinent requirements of State law; and
         d.   Either of the following has been met:
            (1)   All required improvements have been completed, inspected,
accepted, and dedicated; or
            (2)   The subdivider/developer has posted a performance bond or
deposited funds in escrow to guarantee the satisfactory completion and
dedication of all required improvements.
      2.   If the City Council disapproves the final plat, their resolution
shall specify the aspects in which the plat fails to meet the above conditions
for approval.
      3.   The City Clerk shall attach a certified copy of the Council’s
resolution of approval or disapproval to the final plat. One copy of the
resolution and plat shall be retained by the Clerk, one copy shall be filed
with the Administrator, and one copy shall be given to the subdivider.
(2006 Code § 35-3-27)
   G.   Changes In Approved Final Plat: Once a final plat is approved by the
City Council, it shall not thereafter be modified; provided, however, that
minor changes may be made upon written application to the Administrator. Major
changes require the filing of a new final plat and complete review.
(2006 Code § 35-3-28)
10-4-5:   MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS:
   A.   Subdivider’s Responsibilities: The subdivider/developer shall maintain
all the improvements in the subdivision until they have been accepted by and
dedicated to the City or other appropriate entity.
(2006 Code § 35-3-35)
   B.   Maintenance Bond: Prior to dedication, the subdivider/developer shall
post a maintenance bond with the City Clerk in the form approved by the City
Attorney. Said bond shall be in the amount determined by the City Engineer to
be sufficient to guarantee the satisfactory condition of the required
improvements for a period of one year from the date of their acceptance and
dedication. If at any time during the one year period the improvements are
found to be defective, they shall be repaired/replaced at the subdivider/
developer’s expense. If the subdivider/developer fails or refuses to pay such
costs within ninety (90) days after demand is made upon him by the
Administrator, the City shall use the maintenance bond to make the necessary
repairs/replacement. If the cost of repairs/replacement exceeds the bond
amount, the subdivider/developer shall be liable for the excess. At the end of
the one year period, the maintenance bond shall be released.
(2006 Code § 35-3-36)
10-4-6:   VACATION OF PLATS:
In accordance with State law (765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 205/6, 205/7 and
205/8), any plat or part thereof may be vacated by the owner of the tract, at
any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written vacation instrument
to which a copy of the plat is attached. If there are public service facilities
in any street, other public way, or easement shown on said plat, the instrument
shall reserve to the City or other public entity or public utility owning such
facilities the property, rights-of-way, and easements necessary for continuing
public services by means of those facilities and for maintaining or
reconstructing the same. The vacation instrument shall be approved by the City
Council in the same manner as plats of subdivision and shall also be approved
by the Jersey County Superintendent of Highways, the Highway Commissioner of
the appropriate township, the District Engineer of the Illinois Department of
Transportation, the public utilities and any other unit of government the City
Council deems affected. In the case of the platted tracts wherein any lots have
been sold, the written vacation instrument must also be signed by all the
owners of lots in said tracts.

   A.   No land within the subdivision and development jurisdiction of the City
shall be subdivided or developed except in compliance with the regulations of
this chapter and the applicable provisions of State law. (See 65 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/11-12-8 and 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 205/1 et seq.)
No lot in any subdivision shall be conveyed until:
      1.   The final plat of said subdivision has been approved by the City
Council and recorded in the Office of the Jersey County Recorder of Deeds; and
      2.   The portion of said subdivision in which the lot is located has been
improved in accordance with the requirements of this chapter or until a
performance bond or other security has been posted to assure the completion of
such improvements.
   B.   The Administrator shall not issue a building permit for any lot
conveyed in violation of this section.
(2006 Code § 35-5-1)
10-5-2:   SUITABILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT GENERALLY:
Land that is unsuitable for development due to flooding, poor drainage, rough
topography, adverse soil conditions, or other features which will be harmful to
the health, safety, and general welfare of the inhabitants of the development
and/or its surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless the
subdivider/developer formulates adequate plans/methods to solve the problems
caused by the adverse land conditions.
(2006 Code § 35-5-2)
10-5-3:   LOTS:
   A.   Lot Size: All lots in a subdivision shall conform to the minimum lot
area and dimensions requirements of the zoning district in which said
subdivision is located. Land that is under water or reserved for street
improvements shall not be counted to satisfy these minimum requirements. Every
corner and through lot shall be large enough to permit compliance with the
district's front setback requirements on every side of the lot that faces a
street. All lot remnants shall be added to adjacent lots to avoid the creation
of unbuildable parcels. All lots shall contain adequate space for required off
street parking and loading.
(2006 Code § 35-5-4)
   B.   Access And Relationship To Street: Land shall be subdivided in such a
way that each lot abuts a street meeting the requirements of subsection
10-5-4-1A of this chapter. All side lot lines shall be at right angles to
straight street right-of-way lines or radial to curved street right-of-way
lines except where a deviation from this rule will provide a better street and
lot design.
(2006 Code § 35-5-5)
   C.   Reference Monuments: Stone or reinforced concrete reference monuments,
set in the ground in such a manner that they will not be moved by frost, shall
be placed in the field in accordance with the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/0.01 et
seq.), as now or hereafter amended. All lot corners shall be marked by one-half
inch (½") iron pins not less than twenty four inches (24") long. These pins
shall be driven into the ground deep enough that they do not protrude above the
ground surface more than one-half inch (½").
(2006 Code § 35-5-6)
10-5-4:   STREETS:
10-5-4-1:    DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Plan Integration: All streets shall be properly integrated with the
existing and proposed street system indicated in the Municipal Comprehensive
Plan, and shall meet the specifications set forth in Tables 5-A and 5-B,
section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4.
(2006 Code § 35-5-7)
   B.   Right-Of-Way And Pavement Widths: Every right-of-way established for
subdivision purposes is to be separate and distinct from the lots or parcels
adjoining such right-of-way and not included within the dimensions or areas of
such lots or parcels. All rights-of-way shall be dedicated to the public by the
developer.
(2006 Code § 35-5-8)
   C.   Topographical Considerations: Grades of streets shall conform as
closely as possible to the natural topography, but shall not exceed the maximum
grade nor be less than the minimum grade indicated in Table 5-A, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4. All streets shall be arranged so that as many as possible of the
building sites are at or above street grade.
(2006 Code § 35-5-9)
   D.   Through Traffic Discouraged: Marginal access and local streets shall be
laid out so as to discourage use by through traffic. The rigid rectangular
gridiron street pattern shall be avoided, and the use of curvilinear streets,
cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged to effect a more desirable
street layout.
(2006 Code § 35-5-10)
   E.   Limited Access To Arterials: Where a development abuts or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Board of Appeals may recommend to the
City Council that access to said arterial street be limited by one of the
following means:
      1.   By subdividing lots so they back onto the arterial street and front
onto a parallel local street (double frontage lots), coupled with the
installation of screening in a reserve (access restricting) strip along the
rear lot lines of such lots;
      2.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and generally at right angles to the arterial street, with the rear lot
lines of the lots at the termini of such streets backing onto the arterial
street; or
      3.   A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting
strip, but having access thereto at suitable points.
(2006 Code § 35-5-11)
   F.   Dead End Streets:
      1.   Temporary Stub Streets: Streets shall be so arranged to provide for
the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
and police protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and where such
continuation agrees with the City's Official Map. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must dead end temporarily, the right-of-way shall be
extended to the property line, and no strip that would prevent connections with
future streets shall be reserved. A temporary turnabout shall be provided at
the terminus of any temporary dead end street.
      2.   Permanent Dead End Streets:
         a.   For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and
fire protection, permanent dead end streets shall be limited to five hundred
feet (500') in length.
         b.   The terminus of a permanent dead end street shall not be closer
than fifty feet (50') to the boundary of an adjacent tract. A cul-de-sac
turnaround, having a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty feet (50') and a
minimum pavement radius of forty two feet (42'), shall be provided at the end
of every permanent dead end street.
(2006 Code § 35-5-12)
   G.   Intersections:
      1.   Only Two Streets: Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at
any one point.
      2.   Right Angles: Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly
as possible at right angles. In no case shall two (2) streets intersect at an
angle of less than seventy five degrees (75°). An oblique street shall be
curved approaching an intersection and shall be approximately at right angles
with said intersection for at least one hundred feet (100') therefrom.
      3.   Proper Alignment: Proposed new intersections along one side of an
existing street shall, whenever practicable, coincide with any existing
intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline
offsets of less than one hundred twenty five feet (125') shall not be
permitted, except where the intersected street has divided lanes without median
breaks at either intersection. Intersections involving collector or arterial
streets shall be at least eight hundred feet (800') apart.
      4.   Curb Radii: To permit safe vehicular movements at corners, the
minimum R.O.W. radius at the intersection of two (2) streets shall be twenty
feet (20'), and the minimum radius at the back of the curb shall be thirty two
feet (32').
      5.   Flat Grade: Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade
wherever practical. In hilly terrain, an area having not greater than a three
percent (3%) slope for a distance of fifty feet (50') from the nearest right-
of-way line of the intersecting street shall be provided at the approach to an
intersection.
      6.   Maximum Cross Slope: The cross slopes on all streets, including
intersections, shall not exceed three percent (3%).
      7.   Adequate Sight Lines: Where any street intersection will involve
earth banks or existing vegetation on the triangular area, the developer shall
cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the
grading of the public right-of-way to the extent necessary to provide an
adequate sight distance.
(2006 Code § 35-5-13)
   H.   Reverse Curves: A tangent at least one hundred feet (100') long shall
be introduced between reverse curves on local collector and collector streets.
(2006 Code § 35-5-14)
   I.   Improvements To Existing Streets: Whenever any development abuts an
existing street that is narrower than the standards indicated in the Table A,
section
10-5-4-3 this section
10-5-4, the subdivider shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way on the side
abutting the development to permit compliance with those standards. The
developer shall improve said street to the standards imposed at subsection
10-5-4-2C of this section
10-5-4, and pay one-half (½) the cost of said improvements.
(2006 Code § 35-5-15)
   J.   When Excess Right-Of-Way Required: Right-of-way width in excess of the
standards set forth in Table A, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4, shall be required where:
      1.   Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate
earth slopes; or
      2.   Due to the location of railroad tracks, additional width is needed
to construct overpasses, underpasses, and approaches thereto.
(2006 Code § 35-5-16)
10-5-4-2:   IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Developer’s Expense; General Requirements: All streets and alleys shall
be improved solely at the expense of the developer in accordance with the
requirements set forth herein. Typical roadway and pavement sections are shown
in Table 5-A, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4. Requirements for pavement materials, equipment, and methods of
construction for bituminous concrete (flexible) pavements and portland cement
concrete (rigid) pavements are contained in Table 5-B, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4. Existing streets that adjoin the development on one side only will be
improved to half the width of the current street standards, and this cost will
be borne by the developer. Existing streets that join in the development on
both sides shall be improved at the developer's expense. The extent of the
improvement of existing streets will be determined by the City and the
developer during the improvement plan approval process. All streets shall meet
IDOT Roads and Bridges Standard Specifications.
   B.   Pavement Structure: All streets and alleys shall be paved across the
entire surface width specified in subsection
10-5-4-1B of this section
10-5-4. The structural composition of the pavement shall conform to the minimum
requirements set forth in Table 5-B, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4. Design requirements for both rigid and flexible pavements are as
follows:
      1.   Flexible Pavements: Flexible pavements are to be constructed as
multilayered structures combining hot mix bituminous concrete/bituminous base/
crushed stone base/subbase. Each layer of material is to be constructed in
lifts not to exceed the maximum lift thickness (compacted) specified in Table
5-B, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4. The minimum width of any single pass for any lift/layer of bituminous
mixture shall be ten feet (10'). There are alternate designs for either deep
strength asphalt or bituminous concrete on a crushed stone base/subbase.
      2.   Rigid Pavements: Rigid pavements are specified as either reinforced
or nonreinforced portland cement concrete to be constructed either on the earth
subgrade or on a crushed stone subbase or underlayment. Alternate designs are
shown for two (2) of the seven (7) street classifications. The underlayment is
to be one-fourth inch (1/4") thick fabric such as”Bedim” or “Petromat”, or
equal.
         a.   Contraction joints are to be provided at the spacings shown in
Table 5-B, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4, for each of the various alternates. These transverse joints are to be
sawed joints that are one-eighth inch (1/8") to one-fourth inch (1/4") wide
with a depth equal to one-fourth (1/4) of the pavement thickness. Sawed
construction joints are to be sawed within twenty four (24) hours of placement
on the concrete. All contraction joints are to be dowelled with the exception
of the alleys and land access residential streets. Dowel sizes and spacing
shall comply with the following requirements:
 
Minimum Pavement Minimum Dowel Minimum Dowel Length Minimum Dowel Spacing
Thickness        Diameter
6"               5/8"          12"                  12"
7"               3/4"          15"                  15"
8"               1"            15"                  12"
 
The dowel units are to be smooth, plain, round bars placed at mid-height of the
pavement with an expansion cap on one end. The bars, or assemblies, shall be
placed so that the bars are parallel to the centerline and to the pavement
surface and shall be treated to prevent bonding of the concrete.
         b.   Longitudinal joints shall be constructed no closer than eight
feet (8') and no farther apart than fifteen feet (15'). The longitudinal joints
may be either “construction” joints or “sawed” joints. In either case, there
shall be transverse #4 reformed tie bars, thirty inches (30") long, spaced at
thirty inch (30") centers along all longitudinal joints. This includes the
joint between the pavement and curb/gutter if the curb/gutter is not
constructed integral with the pavement. As an option to tie bars, either a
half-round or trapezoidal preformed keyway meeting the following dimensions may
be used on longitudinal joints excluding the gutter joint:
 
Pavement Thickness Half-Round Trapezoidal Edge Inside Depth Inside Height
                   Diameter   Height
6"                 2"         2"               1"           1"
7"                 2"         2"               1"           1"
8"                 2"         2"               1"           1"
 
Sawed longitudinal joints shall be sawed within ten (10) days of concrete
placement and prior to any traffic or vehicles traveling on the surface.
         c.   Transverse construction joints shall be constructed at the end of
each day’s run or at locations where a "cold" joint will occur due to a delay
or interruption in placement operations. All transverse construction joints
shall be “tied” with #4 reformed bars, thirty six inches (36") long, spaced at
twelve inch (12") centers. Construction joints must be at least five feet (5')
from a contraction joint.
         d.   Pavement reinforcement shall be used in all rigid pavements
designated as S.R.P.C.C. in Table 5-B, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4. Reinforcement shall be welded wire fabric (6" x 12") with W4 wire
transversely and W5.5 wire longitudinally weighing approximately fifty four
(54) pounds per one hundred (100) square feet. The fabric shall be lapped
twelve inches (12") on transverse laps and six inches (6") on longitudinal
laps. Reinforcement shall be placed on the subgrade and supported by proper
chairs and spacers, prior to paving, at the heights specified below:
 
Pavement Thickness Depth Below Pavement Surface
6"                 2" minimum, 3" maximum
7"                 2" minimum, 3" maximum
8"                 3" minimum, 4" maximum
 
Should the Administrator and/or City Engineer or the developer’s engineer
determine that the minimal standards are not adequate for a given condition
(i.e., traffic volume, size of loads, subgrade support, drainage, etc.), the
required pavement design shall be determined by the subdivider’s engineer on
the basis of current pavement design procedures subject to the approval of the
City Engineer.
(2006 Code § 35-5-20)
   C.   Curb And Gutter:
      1.   All streets, except alleys and collector commercial, local
commercial, arterial or industrial, shall be constructed with portland cement
concrete vertical curb and gutter, V-type gutter and/or mountable curb in
accordance with the dimensions and specifications shown therefor in Tables 5-
A and 5-B, section
10-5-4-3 of this section
10-5-4. Only vertical curb and gutter shall be constructed in industrial
streets. The materials and construction methods for curb and/or gutter shall
conform with IDOT Roads and Bridges Standard Specifications.
      2.   Curb and/or gutter may be constructed either integrally or
separately in conjunction with portland cement concrete pavement. If
constructed separately, the gutter flag shall be “tied” to P.C.C. pavement with
thirty inch (30") long #4 reinforcing bars spaced at thirty inch (30") centers.
(2006 Code § 35-5-21)
   D.   Maintenance Responsibility:
      1.   Subsequent to completion of street construction by the subdivider,
the City Engineer shall make a final inspection of all streets to ascertain the
acceptability of structural condition, earth slopes, drainage structures, etc.
If said inspection indicates no deficient items, the City shall take formal
action to accept the completed streets for maintenance based upon the
Engineer’s recommendation.
      2.   Should any item need correction or repair, the subdivider will be
notified in writing of each deficiency. No street(s) will be accepted in a
subdivision until all streets comply with the City’s requirements to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer.

Clerk shall maintain a list of existing street names for reference. A street
which is planned as a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same
name.
(2006 Code § 35-5-35)
10-5-9:   EASEMENTS:
   A.   Easements Required: At locations within the subdivision where utilities
and drainage facilities are not to be constructed within public rights-of-way,
the subdivider shall make provision for easements for such installations.
Preliminary plats shall be submitted to the electric, gas, and telephone
companies for their input regarding utility easements. All utilities, including
cable television, shall be installed underground.
(2006 Code § 35-5-37)
   B.   Utility Easements: Utility easements not less than twenty feet (20')
wide for sanitary sewers and water mains and not less than fifteen feet (15')
wide for gas, electric, telephone, and cable television shall be provided where
necessary. Normally, in the case of abutting lots, an equal amount should be

lot shall be properly connected thereto at the property line. All water
distribution lines shall be approved by the City Water Department.
(2006 Code § 35-5-42)
   B.   Fire Hydrants: Fire hydrants of the type approved by the Water and
Sewer Department Manager shall be installed in every subdivision as part of the
water distribution system. The distance from any lot to a hydrant, measured
along the centerline of the public right-of-way, shall not be greater than four
hundred feet (400').
(2006 Code § 35-5-43)
10-5-11:   SEWER SYSTEM:
   A.   Compliance With Regulations: All proposed sanitary sewer facilities
shall comply with the regulations of the Illinois Department of Public Health
and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and must be approved by the
City. All water and sewer lines must be constructed as per Standard
Specifications for Water and Sewer Mains, State of Illinois, 4th Edition, or as
amended.
(2006 Code § 35-5-45)
   B.   Planned Public System: In areas where the public sanitary sewerage
system is not reasonably accessible but where plans for the installation of
said system have been approved by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency,
sanitary sewers shall be provided in accordance with such plans and temporarily
capped. To serve the subdivision until the time when connection to the public
system becomes available, an approved private central sewage disposal system
shall be installed, or individual sewage disposal systems may be used.
(2006 Code § 35-5-46)
   C.   Alternate Methods Of Disposal: In the event it is not possible for the
subdivider to extend the public sewer system into the proposed subdivision, the
subdivider has the right to petition the City to allow the installation of an
alternative method of sewage disposal. Any such petition shall be considered on
an individual basis with each case standing on its own merit. No subdivision
shall be approved without the City’s approval of the method of sewage disposal.
      1.   Private Central Sewage Systems: Upon specific approval of the City
Council, the subdivider may install a private central sewage system. The City
shall reserve the right to review and approve or reject the detailed plans for
such a system. Approval of the plans by the City shall in no way be construed
as acceptance of the design or operation or maintenance responsibility for said
installation. Such installation shall be designed and constructed in accordance
with the rules and regulations of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
and the Illinois Department of Public Health. The subdivider shall assume
perpetual operational and maintenance responsibilities for such installation
unless arrangements to the contrary are provided for in a formal written
agreement between home owners and the subdivider.
      2.   Individual Disposal Systems: Upon written approval of the City
Council, the subdivider may install individual sewage disposal systems
providing the lot size is in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet. If
such installations are permitted, they shall be designed and installed in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the requirements and regulations
of the “Private Sewage Disposal Licensing Act and Code” of the Illinois
Department of Public Health (225 ILCS 225/1 et seq.)
