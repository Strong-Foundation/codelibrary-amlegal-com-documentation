proceedings shall, as far as practicable, conform to the law in force at the
tide of the proceeding. (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 70, § 4)
   (C)   If any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment is mitigated by any
provision of a new law, the provision may, by the consent of the party

thereof, shall file with the City Clerk a petition on oath setting forth at
least the following information:
         (a)   The petitioner’s name and residence address;
         (b)   The street address and legal description of the petitioner’s

or part thereof, sought to be vacated;

entitled to notice of the public hearing under subsection (B) below;
         (e)   The identity of the owners of record of all parcels of real
estate, or the owner or owners of record of a particular parcel or parcels of
real estate, abutting on the street or alley, or part thereof, sought to be
vacated, who shall pay to the City the compensation required under this
Section, and the proportions, if any, in which such compensation shall be paid
by more than one owner;
         (f)   A copy of Sidwell’s (or similar) map of the street or alley, or
part thereof, sought to be vacated is located.
      (2)   No such petition shall be accepted for filing unless it is
accompanied by a non-refundable filing fee of $100 payable to the City.
   (B)   Hearing notice; procedure.
      (1)   The Petition to Vacate shall be set for a public hearing before the
Public Works Committee of the City Council at a date not less than 30 and not
more than 60 days after the petition is filed. Not less than ten days before
the date of the public hearing, the Public Works Department of the City shall
notify in writing each owner of record real estate abutting on the street or
alley, or part thereof, sought to be vacated and each owner of record real
estate abutting on any part of the same street or alley which is situated in
the same city block but which does not abut the street or alley, or part
thereof, enclosing with the notice a true copy of the Petition to Vacate.
Failure of any person to receive such notice and failure of the Public Works
Department to notify any person or entity, the identity of which was not
disclosed in the petition, or the identity or address of which was inaccurately
disclosed in the petition, shall not affect the validity of any action taken by
the City Council on the petition. The Public Works Department shall provide to
the Public Works Committee a certificate of service of such notice showing the
names and addresses of all persons and entities to whom notice was sent, and
the date on which such notice was deposited in the U.S. Mail, certified mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid.
      (2)   Not less than ten days before the date of the public hearing, the
Public Works Department of the City shall post a sign on the petitioner’s
property abutting the street or alley, or part thereof, sought to be vacated
stating that the same is subject of a petition to vacate.
      (3)   At the public hearing all interested persons shall be heard
concerning the proposal for Vacation. It shall not be grounds for objection to
the proposed Vacation that its approval may cause the objector some
inconvenience, so long as the objector has a reasonably direct means of access
to his or her property from a public street or highway. By motion, the
Committee shall recommend approval or disapproval of the petition to the City
Council.
   (C)   Valuation.
      (1)   Prior to the public hearing, the Public Works Department shall
ascertain the value of the street or alley, or part thereof, sought to be
vacated according to the following formula:
         The aggregate square footage of the street or alley, or part thereof,
sought to be vacated shall be multiplied by the sum of $0.40, and the product
shall be reported to the petitioner and the City Council and shall be the
amount of compensation paid to the City in consideration of the proposed
vacation.
      (2)   A written report of the value so ascertained shall be made to the
Public Works Committee and to the petitioner prior to the public hearing. For
purposes of this Section, the term “ASSESSED VALUATION” shall mean the most
recent real estate tax assessed valuation of the property in question (for land
only, excluding improvements) as shown by the Vermilion County Supervisor of
Assessment’s records, without reduction for any exemptions granted by law for
real estate tax assessment purposes. In the event that any parcel abutting on
any street or alley or part thereof shall be exempt from real estate taxation,
then that parcel shall be excluded for purposes of calculations under the above
formula. The value so ascertained and reported shall be the compensation
payable to the City in consideration of such proposed Vacation.
   (D)   Verification of public service facilities. Prior to the public
hearing, the Public Works Department shall verify the presence of any utilities
in the street or alley, or part thereof, sought to be vacated, and shall report
the same to the Public Works Committee and to the petitioner prior to such
hearing. If there are any public service facilities located therein, the
ordinance shall reserve to the City or to the public utility, as the case may
be, such property, rights-of-way and easements as may be necessary or desirable
for continuing public services by means of such facilities and for maintenance,
renewal and reconstruction thereof.
   (E)   Action by City Council. At its next regularly scheduled meeting
following the public hearing, the City Council shall consider the Petition to
Vacate. If the City Council determines that the public interest will be
subserved by vacating such street or alley, or part thereof, it may do so by
ordinance passed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the City Council. No
ordinance so passed shall be effective until it is recorded in the Recorder’s
Office of Vermilion County, Illinois.
   (F)   Compensation; payment. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
(E) above, the City Council shall not consider for action any Petition for
Vacation hereunder until the first regular meeting of the City Council which
occurs after the public hearing and after the compensation required under this
Section has been deposited with the City Clerk. In the event the City Council
denies the petition, such deposit shall be returned to the petitioner within
seven days of the denial. In the event the City Council approves the petition,
the City Clerk shall transfer to the general fund of the City the amount of
compensation so deposited, and the City Clerk shall cause the ordinance to be
recorded.
   (G)   Effect of Vacation. Except in cases where the deed or other instrument
dedicating a street or alley, or part thereof, has expressly provided for a
specific devolution of the title thereto upon the abandonment or Vacation
thereof, whenever any street or alley, or part thereof, is vacated under this
Section:
      (1)   If the ordinance of Vacation provides that only the owner or owners
of one particular parcel of abutting real estate shall pay the compensation
required under this Section, then the owner or owners of the particular parcel
shall acquire title to the entire street or alley, or part thereof, so vacated;
or,
      (2)   If the ordinance of Vacation does not so provide, then the title to
the land included within the street or alley, or part thereof, so vacated,
vests in the then owners of the land abutting thereon, in the same proportions
and to the same extent as though the street or alley had been dedicated by a
common law plat (as distinguished from a statutory plat) and as though the fee
of the street or alley had been acquired by the owners as a part of the land
abutting on the street or alley.

§ 30.11 SALE OR TRADE OF TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Whenever the City Council determines by resolution passed by a
majority of the Aldermen then holding office that certain tangible personal
property is no longer necessary or useful to the City or the retention thereof
is no longer in the best interest of the City, the same may be sold by the
Mayor or his designee in such manner and upon such terms and conditions, with
or without advertising or bidding, as the City Council may establish in such

of the Purchasing Manual, then the bid specifications shall identify the trade-
in items.

provisions of the Purchasing Manual, then no tangible personal property shall
be used for trade-in purposes without the prior approval of the City Council by
resolutions passed as provided in division (A) above.

whenever the Mayor determines that an item of tangible personal property is no
longer necessary or useful to the City, or the retention thereof is no longer
in the best interests of the City, and that the resale value of such item is
less than $100 or the resale value of an aggregate of such items is less than
$1,000, then the Mayor is authorized to dispose of the same by donation to any
not-for-profit, charitable or governmental entity or by discarding the same as
refuse. In the case of any action under this subsection, the Mayor shall
execute a written memorandum stating the item(s) disposed of, the value of each
item, the donee(s) thereof, if any, and his findings under this subsection,
which memorandum shall be delivered to the Comptroller and the City Clerk for
retention in their records.

§ 30.12 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Scope of policy. The investment policy applies to the investment
activities of all funds under the jurisdiction of the City except the Fire and
Police Pension Funds. The investment policy will also apply to any new funds or
temporary funds placed under the jurisdiction of the City. The Illinois State
Statutes will take precedence except where this policy is more restrictive
wherein this policy will take precedence.
   (B)   Objectives. The purpose of this investment policy is to establish cash
management and investment guidelines for the stewardship of public funds under
the jurisdiction of the City. The specific objectives of this policy will be as
follows:
      (1)   Safety. The security of monies, whether on hand or invested, shall
be the primary concern of the Treasurer in selecting depositories or
investments.
      (2)   Liquidity. The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently
liquid to meet all operating requirements, which might be reasonably
anticipated.
      (3)   Return. The Treasurer shall seek to attain a market average or
better rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into
account risk, constraints, cash flow, and legal restriction on investment.
      (4)   Local considerations. The Treasurer shall have preference to
depositories located within the City provided that the described objectives are
met, and such investments would be in compliance with all other conditions and
limitations of this investment policy; however, the Treasurer may approve
qualified depositories regardless of location.
   (C)   Guidelines. To assist in attaining the stated objectives, the
following guidelines shall be observed:
      (1)   Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to insure
preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To avoid unreasonable risks,
diversification of investments is required.
      (2)   The portfolio should remain sufficiently liquid to meet operating
requirements, which may reasonably be anticipated. Cash flows shall be reviewed
quarterly.
      (3)   To maximize earnings, all funds shall be deposited/invested within
two working days at prevailing rates or better.
      (4)   All investments shall be selected on the basis of competitive bids.
   (D)   Diversification. To avoid unreasonable risks, diversification of the
investment portfolio shall be consistent with the objectives in the investment
policy. Commercial paper shall not exceed 10% of the investment portfolio.
   (E)   Responsibility. All investment of funds under the control of the
Treasurer is the direct responsibility of the Treasurer. The Treasurer shall be
responsible for all transactions and shall establish a system of controls for
all authorized subordinates who are directly involved in the assistance of such
investment activities.
   (F)   Performance measures (bench mark). The use of U.S. Treasury bills,
average Fed Fund rate, Illinois Funds, or other stable markets can be used to
determine whether market yields are being achieved.
   (G)   Periodic review. The Treasurer should establish annual independent
review for internal control, which assures compliance within the investment
policy. This will be accomplished with external auditors.
   (H)   Reporting. All investment transactions shall be recorded by the
Treasurer. A report will be generated, at least monthly, listing all active
investments, location of investments, maturity of investments, interest rate
and other pertinent information deemed necessary. This report will be submitted
monthly to the City Council.
   (I)   Investment vehicles. The City shall limit its investments to those
allowed by law as set out in ILCS Ch. 30, Act 235, § 2. A summary of allowable
securities follows:
      (1)   Notes, bonds, certificates of indebtedness, treasury bills, or
other securities, which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America as to principal and interest.
      (2)   Bonds, notes, debentures, or other similar obligations of the
United States of America or its agencies.
      (3)   Interest bearing accounts, certificates of deposit or interest
bearing time deposits or any other investment constituting direct obligations
of any bank as defined by the Illinois Banking Act.
      (4)   Short-term obligations (corporate paper) of corporations organized
in the United States with assets exceeding $500,000,000 if:
         (a)   Such obligations are rated at the time of purchase within the
three highest classifications established by at least two standard rating
services and which mature not later than 180 days from the date of purchase,
and
         (b)   Such purchases do not exceed ten percent of the corporation's
outstanding obligations, or
         (c)   In money market mutual funds registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.
      (5)   Money market mutual funds registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, provided that the portfolio of any such money market mutual fund
is limited to obligations described in subsections (I) (1) or (I) (2) of this
section and to agreements to repurchase such obligations.
      (6)   And any other authorized investments provided under the Illinois
Public Funds Investment act as in effect from time to time.
   (J)   Financial institutions. The Treasurer with the concurrence of the City
Council will have the sole responsibility to select which financial (Illinois
Funds, banks, savings and loan, credit unions and other non-banks) institutions
will be depositories for the City. Any financial institution, upon meeting the
requirements of the Illinois Compiled Statutes and of this policy, may request
to become a depository for the City. The City will take into consideration
security, size, location, financial condition, service, fees, competitiveness,
and the community relations involvement of the financial institution when
choosing depositories.
   (K)   Collateralization.  
      (1)   At all times in order to meet the objective of safety of capital,
the Treasurer will require deposits in excess of the Federally insured amount
to be collateralized to the extent of 110% and evidenced by an approved written
agreement.
      (2)   Eligible collateral instruments and collateral rates (market value
divided by deposit) are as follows:
         (a)   Negotiable obligations of the United States Government;   =110%
         (b)   Negotiable obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the
United States Government backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States Government;    =110%
         (c)   Negotiable obligations of the State which are rated A or better
by Moodys or Standard and Poors;   =110%
         (d)   Negotiable obligations of the City which are rated A or better
by Moodys or Standard and Poors;   =110%
      (3)   Maturity of acceptable collateral shall not exceed 120 months.
      (4)   The ratio of fair market value of collateral to the amount of funds
secured shall be reviewed weekly and additional collateral will be requested
when the ratio declines below the level required.
      (5)   Safekeeping of collateral.  
         (a)   Third party safekeeping is required for all collateral. To
accomplish this, the securities will be held at a safekeeping depository as
approved from time to time by the Treasurer.
         (b)   Safekeeping will be documented by an approved written agreement.
Substitution, exchange or release of securities held in safekeeping may be done
upon two days prior written notice to the Treasurer.
         (c)   When collateral is expended, the Treasurer should receive a copy
of the financial institution’s board minutes, indicating the Board of
Directors’ approval.
   (L)   Safekeeping of securities. Securities, unless held physically by the
Treasurer, require third party safekeeping. The Treasurer will have the sole
responsibility for selecting safekeeping agents. Safekeeping will be documented
by an approved written agreement.
   (M)   Standard of care.  
      (1)   Investment shall be made with judgement and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the possible income to be derived. The Treasurer shall be
the Chief Investment Officer.
      (2)   In maintaining its investment portfolio, the Treasurer shall avoid
any transaction that might impair public confidence in the City. The above
standards are established as standards for professional responsibility and
shall be applied in the context of managing the portfolio.
      (3)   Treasurer acting in accordance with this investment policy and
procedures as have been or may be established and exercising due diligence
shall be relieved of personal liability for an individual security’s credit
risk or market changes.

financial accounts for the City, subject to this policy. Any three of the
following office holders are authorized to sign on financial accounts of the
City: Treasurer, Mayor, Comptroller and Clerk.

CODE OF ETHICS
§ 30.20 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officers
and employees (hereinafter referred to as “public servants”) be independent,
impartial, and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy
be made within the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public
office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in
the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of
ethics for all public servants working for the people of this city is adopted.
This code is designed to establish guidelines for setting forth those acts or
actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.21 PURPOSE.
   The purposes of this code of ethics are:
   (A)   To assure the integrity of the city government and to sustain the
confidence and trust of the people of the city in their public servants and in
the local governmental process.
   (B)   To provide a comprehensive and unified statement of the ethical
principles, considerations and obligations inherent in government service, and
establish specific standards of conduct to assure that those entrusted with
authority avoid conduct that might undermine the public's respect for their
local government.
   (C)   To establish a positive, effective and comprehensive ethics program
which is clear, practical and fair.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.22 FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.
   It is declared that:
   (A)   High moral and ethical standards among public servants in local
government are essential to the conduct of fair, open and responsive
representative government.
   (B)   The people of the city need and deserve a local government led by
outstanding public servants whose devotion and commitment to pursuing the
public interest through established democratic processes outweigh personal or
political considerations.
   (C)   Upon taking the oath of office, elected officers enter into a solemn
trust with the people of the city involving extraordinary legal and moral
obligations. One aspect of these obligations requires that those entrusted with
public authority unfailingly demonstrate that they are worthy of the public's
respect and are devoted to maintaining the absolute integrity of government.
   (D)   Effective democratic government depends upon the willingness of the
people to exercise responsible citizenship by voluntary compliance with laws
and by active participation in the democratic process. When the public's trust
in and respect for government is high, citizens are more likely to fully
participate by voting, becoming better informed, and becoming more active in
public debate and discourse in a way that engenders civic pride and makes
government more representative, more responsive and more effective.
   (E)   Unethical or illegal behavior by any public servant tends to diminish
the stature of local government and produce cynicism that erodes public
confidence. Thus, all who serve the city have a solemn responsibility to avoid
improper conduct and prevent such behavior by colleagues and subordinates.
   (F)   The principles of public service ethics pervading this subchapter view
the ethical obligations of public servants in a positive way. High standards of
conduct and specific regulations to enforce them are not driven by negative
assumptions about the character of those who serve government, but are
expressions of the need for clarity and uniformity about the higher duties of
public service and the noble dimension of democracy.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.23 PRINCIPLE OF GOOD FAITH.
   Each provision of this subchapter shall be construed and implemented with
integrity and a good faith commitment to advance rather than evade the purpose
and spirit of the provision.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.24 PRINCIPLE OF NONPARTISANSHIP.
   All actions, decisions and votes on matters relating to this subchapter
shall be made purely on their merits. Decisions shall be made objectively and
independently, and without political party or ideological partisanship.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.25 PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC INTEREST.
   (A)   General rule. Public servants shall treat their government positions
as a public trust, using the powers and resources of public office only to
advance public interests, and not to attain personal benefits or pursue any
other private interest incompatible with the public good.
   (B)   Primacy of democratic processes. In pursuing the public interest
public servants shall scrupulously observe and abide by the United States and
Illinois Constitutions, all applicable local laws and democratic processes.
   (C)   Pursuing broad public good. In pursuing the public interest, public
servants shall:
      (1)   Put loyalty to democratic principles and to their conscientious
convictions about the overall public good above loyalty to political party,
narrow constituency, and individual interests which are inconsistent with the
general public interest.
      (2)   Allocate public funds and formulate general public policies only
after evaluating information objectively and deciding what is best for the
public as a whole, not just for a narrow constituency.
      (3)   Take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard and protect the
reputation of the city government and integrity and efficiency of their office,
subordinating the personal interests of superiors, colleagues and friends to
the interests of the city.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.26 PRINCIPLE OF ACCOUNTABILITY.
   Public servants shall assure that government is conducted openly,
efficiently, equitably and honorably in a manner that permits the citizenry to
make informed judgments and hold government officials accountable.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.27 PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP.
   Public servants should honor and respect the principles and spirit of
representative democracy and set a positive example of good citizenship by
scrupulously observing the letter and spirit of laws and rules.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.28 PRINCIPLE OF INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT.
   Public servants shall employ independent, objective judgment in performing
their duties, deciding all matters on the merits, free from conflicts of
interest and both real and apparent improper influences.
(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.29 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   Except as hereinafter provided, no public servant, whether paid or unpaid,
shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or other
personal interest, either direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the
proper discharge of his or her official duties in the public interest or would
tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance
of his or her official duties.
   Prohibited conflicts of interest shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
   (A)   Interest in contract transaction, zoning decision, or other matter. No
public servant having the power or duty to perform an official act or action
related to a contract, transaction, zoning decision, or other matter which is
or may be the subject of an official act or action of the city, shall:
      (1)   Have or thereafter acquire an interest in such contract,
transaction, zoning decision, or other matter, except as otherwise stated in
this subchapter; or
      (2)   Have an interest in any business entity representing, advising, or
appearing on behalf of, whether paid or unpaid, any person involved in such
contract, transaction, zoning decision, or other matter, except as otherwise
stated in this subchapter; or
      (3)   Have solicited or accepted present or future employment with a
person or business entity involved in such contract, transaction, zoning
decision, or other matter, at the time of the city's action on the contract,
transaction, zoning decision, or other matter; or
      (4)   Have solicited, accepted, or granted a present or future gift,
favor, service, or thing of value from or to a person involved in such
contract, transaction, zoning decision, or other matter; or
      (5)   Have encouraged, made, or accepted any ex parte or unilateral
application or communication where a determination is to be made after a
contested public hearing and such public servant refuses to make the contents
of the communication a part of the record.
   (B)   Property. No officer of the city shall be interested, directly or
indirectly, in the purchase of any property that:
      (1)   Belongs to the city;
      (2)   Is sold for taxes or assessments; or
      (3)   Is sold by virtue of legal process at the suit of the city.
   (C)   Pre-acquisition of interest. No public servant shall acquire an
interest in, or an interest affected by, any contract, transaction, zoning
decision, or other matter at a time when such public servant believes or has
reason to believe the interest will be directly or indirectly affected by an
official act or action of the city.
   (D)   Appearances. No public servant shall appear or act as a representative
on behalf of any private person, other than himself or herself, or his or her
immediate family, before any city agency. However, a member of the City Council
may appear before city agencies on behalf of his constituents in the course of
his or her duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance
of public or civic obligations, but a City Council member shall not receive
compensation for such appearances.
   (E)   Disclosure of interest in legislative action. In addition to any other
requirements of law:
      (1)   Any member of the City Council who has a financial or personal
interest in any proposed legislation before the Council shall disclose, on the
record of the Council, the nature and extent of such interest and such member
shall abstain from participating in any vote relating to the proposed
legislation, although such member shall be considered present for purposes of
establishing a quorum.
      (2)   Any other officer or employee who has a financial or personal
interest in any proposed legislative action of the City Council and who
participates in discussion with or gives an official opinion or recommendation
to the Council, shall disclose on the record of the Council the nature and
extent of such interest.
   (F)   Disclosure of confidential information. No public servant, with
respect to any contract, transaction, zoning decision, or other matter which is
or may be the subject of an official act or action of the city, shall, without
proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the
property, government, or affairs of the city, or use such information to
advance the financial or other private interest of such public servant or
others.
   (G)   Incompatible service. No public servant shall engage in or accept
private employment or render service for hire, on behalf of private interests,
when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of
his or her official duties or would tend to impair his or her independence of
judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties, unless
otherwise permitted by law and unless disclosure is made as provided in this
subchapter.
   (H)   Public property. No public servant shall use city-owned vehicles,
equipment, materials, data or property for personal convenience except as
authorized by the terms of their employment. No person, other than a public
servant, shall use city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials, data or property
without first obtaining proper authorization from the Mayor.
   (I)   Special treatment. No public servant shall grant any special
consideration, treatment or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is
available to other citizens in similar circumstances.
   (J)   Later case interest. No public servant shall, after the termination of
service or employment with the city, appear before any board, commission,
committee or agency of the city in relation to any case, proceeding,
application, or contract, in which he or she personally participated during the
period of his or her service or employment or which was under his or her active
consideration, for a period of 12 months from the date of termination of his or
her employment with the city.
   (K)   Exceptions to conflict of interest provisions. Notwithstanding the
prohibitions in division (A) of this section, the exceptions allowed under the
Illinois Municipal Code and the Corrupt Practices Act, applicable to interests
in contracts, shall be applicable to the provisions of this subchapter. The

ILCS Ch. 50, Act 105, § 3.2 in effect from time to time are hereby incorporated

conflict with his or her duties as a city officer or employee, he or she shall
terminate city employment prior to assuming the elected position;
      (2)   If a city officer or employee seeks election to a city office, then

(Ord. 7781, passed 9-5-95)
§ 30.31 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any public servant who knowingly violates any of the provisions of

      (1)   Divestiture of specified assets or withdrawal from specified
relationships;
      (2)   Restitution or reimbursement;
      (3)   Voiding any governmental action resulting from conduct in violation

requiring the relinquishment of any prohibited interest or the voiding of any
such contract, transaction, zoning decision, or other matter, taking into

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 31.01 BACKGROUND; PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (A)   The present form of government in the City was established as a result
of a decree of the Federal District Court issued on February 25, 1987. The
decree resulted from litigation in the form of a voters rights case seeking
equal representation for all citizens in the selection of the governing body
for the City. The new government which went into effect on September 19, 1987
provided for a City Council made up of 14 Aldermen elected from seven wards and
a full-time Mayor elected at large. In addition a full-time Treasurer was to be
elected in the same manner as the Mayor.
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is twofold:
      (1)   As a general explanation as to how the government of the City is
organized; and
      (2)   To provide a guide for the conduct of City Council business.
   (C)   The text of the original ordinances enabling the new form of
government and subsequent rules set by the City Council have been included
herein. The intent of the City Council shall be to record all operational and
procedural rules in this chapter, and as such, these rules of procedure shall
be maintained as the official City Council rules, as amended from time to time
through subsequent ordinances affecting such rules.

also at the time of a roll call vote on any proposition. Where less than a
quorum remains at a meeting, business must be suspended. In the absence of a
quorum, the Aldermen present may adjourn or provide for an adjourned meeting.
When a quorum is not present at the call of roll to begin a meeting, the
members present will declare no legal meeting, but shall have the power to set
a recommended date and time for such meeting. If the transaction of business is
imperative before the next regular meeting, a special meeting may be called and
the proof thereof properly recorded. In determining whether there is a quorum,
members present at the meeting of the Council are counted as present whether or
not they occupy their respective seats. If a member comes into a meeting after
it is called to order, the minutes at that point in the record should state:
"Alderman Green entered the meeting and took his seat at (time)." If a member
departs from the meeting, the minutes should state: "Alderman Green left the
meeting at (time)."
   (B)   Regular meetings. The regular meetings of the City Council shall be
held on the first and third Tuesdays of each month of the year at the hour of

upon a legal holiday shall be held on the next following day which is not a
holiday at the same hour and place.
   (C)   Special meetings. Special meetings may be called by the Mayor or any
three Aldermen upon not less than 48 hours' written notice, in accordance with
the Illinois State Statutes pertaining to the Open Meetings Act. The notice
shall specify the date, time and place of the special meeting and the business
to be transacted. No other business, other than as recited in the notice, shall
be transacted at such special meeting.
   (D)   The City Clerk, or Mayor’s Assistant or designee, shall be responsible

FINANCES
§ 36.01 ISSUANCE OF BONDS.
   The city, acting by the council, may borrow money for proper public purposes
and in evidence of this borrowing issue its full faith and credit bonds payable
from ad valorem taxes to be levied without limitation as to rate or amount
against all taxable property situated within the city. These bonds may be
issued without the submission of the question of their issuance to the electors
of the city for their approval. The procedures for the issuance of these bonds
shall be substantially as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 6379, passed 9-28-76)
§ 36.02 BOND ORDINANCE.
   The council shall adopt a bond ordinance describing the public purpose or
purposes to be accomplished by borrowing and make a finding that the borrowing
of money is necessary for the welfare of the city, is for a public purpose or
is in the public interest. This finding shall be deemed conclusive.
(Ord. 6379, passed 9-28-76)
§ 36.03 (RESERVED).
§ 36.04 DETAILS OF BONDS; PRIOR CONTRACTS.
   (A)   The bond ordinance shall indicate the amount of money to be borrowed
and the amount of bonds to be issued and shall fix the details of the bonds,
including the date, number, denomination, and maturity, which shall not exceed
40 years from the date of the bonds, terms of redemption with or without
premium if redeemable prior to maturity, and the rate or rates of interest. The
bonds shall be sold at the time and manner determined by the council.
   (B)   A contract for the sale of bonds may be entered into prior to the
adoption of the bond ordinance or the bond ordinance may provide for the
subsequent sale of the bonds. In the event of the subsequent sale, if bonds are
sold bearing interest at a rate or rates less than the maximum rate authorized,
prior to the delivery of the bonds the taxes levied in the bond ordinance shall
be abated by that amount representing the savings resulting from the sale of
such bonds at a lower rate of interest than authorized in the bond ordinance.

§ 36.05 EXECUTION OF BONDS.
   (A)   The bond ordinance shall direct the execution of the bonds on behalf

principal and interest. It shall indicate the place or places of payment of the
principal and interest maturing on the bonds and set forth the form of bond.

the bond ordinance, as adopted, certified by the city clerk, shall be filed in
the office of the county clerk of the county within which any part of the city
may be situated. The bond ordinance, as so filed, shall constitute the
authority for the county clerk in and for each of the years for which taxes are
levied in the bond ordinance, to extend taxes for collection against all the
taxable property situated within the city. The taxes so levied for the payment
of principal of and interest on the bonds shall be extended annually by the
county clerk without limitation as to rate or amount and the taxes shall be in
addition to and in excess of all other taxes levied or authorized to be levied
by the city. Except as provided, the taxes so levied shall not be subject to
repeal or abatement in any manner whatsoever until such time as all the bonds
authorized and issued under the terms of the bond ordinance shall have been
paid in full, both principal and interest, up to and including the date of
maturity. However, if the city has other funds available, the council may
appropriate these funds and deposit them in trust with an escrow agent for the
purpose of the payment of any of the maturities of bonds or interest, in which
event the taxes so levied to pay such principal or interest may be abated by
the amount deposited, such abatement to be directed by ordinance of the city,
duly adopted by the council and placed on file with the county clerk at any
time prior to the extension of these taxes for collection.
(Ord. 6379, passed 9-28-76)
§ 36.07 APPROPRIATION; USE OF PROCEEDS.
   (A)   The provisions of the bond ordinance shall constitute an appropriation
of the amounts required and on the delivery of the bonds the proceeds shall be
used solely for the purpose for which the bonds were authorized.
   (B)   Upon the adoption of the bond ordinance by the city council and its
signing by the mayor or 2 commissioners, it shall be published in pamphlet form
or in a newspaper published and of general circulation in the city. If there is
no newspaper, then in a newspaper published in the county in which the city or

the city. The bond ordinance shall become effective immediately on publication.

ordinance and any bonds issued and outstanding which by their terms are payable
from taxes unlimited as to rate or amount and levied against all the taxable
property within the city, may be refunded prior to their maturity or at their
maturity. Matured interest coupons evidencing interest on these unpaid bonds

the terms, conditions, and provisions required for the issuance of bonds for
public purposes.

governing body of the municipality. Pending the preparation of the definitive
bonds, interim receipts or certificates in such form and with such provisions
as the governing body of the municipality may determine, may be issued to the
purchaser or purchasers of bonds sold pursuant to §§
36.55 through

§ 36.59 COVENANTS IN BONDS.

project for which the bonds are to be issued, including the creation and

or any rehabilitation, improvements, renovations, enlargements or additions

36.55 through
36.65 may provide that the principal of an interest on any bonds issued under
these sections shall be secured by a mortgage or indenture of trust covering
the project for which the bonds are issued and may include any improvements or
extensions thereafter made. The mortgage or indenture of trust may contain such
covenants and agreements to properly safeguard the bonds as may be provided for
in the ordinance authorizing the bonds and shall be executed in the manner as
may be provided for in the ordinance.
   (C)   The provisions of §§

may be designated in the ordinance authorizing the bonds and the signatures
shall be the valid and binding signatures of the officers of the municipality,
notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof and payments therefor any or
all of the persons whose signatures appear thereon have ceased to be officers
of the municipality issuing the bonds. The validity of the bonds is not
dependent on nor affected by the validity or regularity of any proceedings
relating to the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction,
improvement, equipping, betterment or extension of the project for which the
bonds are issued. The ordinance authorizing the bonds may provide that the
bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to §§

regularity of their issuance.
(Ord. 6067, passed 11-20-73)
§ 36.61 LIEN OF BONDS.
   All bonds issued under §§
36.55 through

which the bonds have been issued, and the governing body may provide in the
ordinance or ordinances authorizing the bonds for the issuance of additional

right to compel any exercise of taxing power of the municipality to pay the
bonds, the interest or premium, if any, thereon, and the bonds do not
constitute an indebtedness of the municipality or a loan of credit thereof
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision. It shall be
plainly stated on the face of each bond that it has been issued under the
provisions of §§
36.55 through
36.65 and that it does not constitute an indebtedness of the municipality or a
loan of credit thereof within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory
provisions.
(Ord. 6067, passed 11-20-73)

securities constituting direct obligations of the United States of America; in
certificates of deposit or time deposits constituting direct obligations of any
bank as defined by the Illinois Banking Act, as heretofore and hereafter
amended. However, investments may be made only in those certificates of deposit
or time deposits in banks which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, if then in existence; or in short term discount obligations of the
Federal National Mortgage Association. Any such securities may be purchased at
the offering or market price thereof at the time of the purchase.
(Ord. 6067, passed 11-20-73)
§ 36.64 EXEMPTION FROM CONSTRUCTION AND BIDDING REQUIREMENTS.
   The acquisition and construction of a project shall not be subject to any
requirements relating to public buildings, structures, grounds, works or
improvements imposed by the Illinois Compiled Statutes or any other similar
requirements which may be lawfully waived by this section. Any requirement of
competitive bidding or restriction imposed on the procedure for award of
contracts for such purpose or the lease, sale or other disposition of property
of the municipality is not applicable to any action taken under authority of §§
36.55 through
36.65.
(Ord. 6067, passed 11-20-73)
§ 36.65 POWERS CONFERRED AS SUPPLEMENTAL; LIMITATIONS; EFFECT.
   The powers conferred by §§
36.55 through
36.65 are in addition and supplemental to, and the limitations imposed by these
sections shall not affect the powers conferred by any law or any other
ordinance. Projects may be acquired, purchased, constructed, reconstructed,
improved, bettered, equipped, extended and financed, and bonds may be issued
under §§
36.55 through
36.65 for such purposes, notwithstanding that any law or any other ordinance
may provide for the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction,
improvement, equipping, betterment, extension and financing of a similar
project, or the issuance of bonds for similar purposes, and without regard to
the requirements, restrictions, limitations or other provisions contained in

§ 38.02 MOTION FOR TAKING; CONTENTS.
   (A)   In any proceeding under the provisions of ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, § 7-101
et seq., as amended from time to time, or of this chapter by the city for the
acquisition of land or interests therein for street, highway, or other
municipal purposes, the petitioner, at any time after the petition has been
filed and before judgment is entered in the proceeding, may file a written
motion requesting that, immediately or at some specified later date, the
petitioner either be vested with fee simple title (or such lesser estate,
interest, or easement, as may be required) to the real property, or specified
portion thereof, which is the subject of the proceeding, and be authorized to
take possession of and use such property; or only be authorized to take
possession of and to use such property, if such possession and use, without the
vesting of title, are sufficient to permit the petitioner to proceed with the
project until the final ascertainment of compensation. However, no land or
interests therein now or hereafter owned, leased, controlled, operated, or used
by, or necessary for the actual operation of, any common carrier engaged in
interstate commerce, or any public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the
Illinois Commerce Commission shall be taken or appropriated hereunder by the

and the estate or interest sought to be acquired therein.
      (2)   The formally adopted schedule or plan of operation for the
execution of the petitioner's project.

respect to the schedule or plan.

the motion.

operated by and used by, or necessary for the actual operation of, any
interstate common carrier, or other public utility subject to the jurisdiction
of the Illinois Commerce Commission, a statement to the effect that the
approval of such proposed taking has been secured from the Commission and
attaching to such motion a certified copy of the order of the Commission
granting such approval. If the schedule or plan of operation is not set forth
fully in the motion, a copy of the schedule or plan shall be attached to the
motion.

§ 38.03 HEARING; PRELIMINARY FINDINGS OF COMPENSATION.
   (A)   The court shall fix a date, not less than 5 days after the filing of
the motion, for the hearing thereon, and shall require due notice to be given
to each party to the proceedings whose interest would be affected by the taking
requested, except that any party who has been or is being served by publication
and who has not entered his appearance in the proceeding need not be given
notice unless the court so requires, in its discretion and in the interests of
justice.
   (B)   At the hearing, if the court has not previously, in the same
proceeding, determined that the petitioner has the authority to exercise the
right of eminent domain, that the property sought to be taken is subject to the
exercise of such right, and that such right is not being improperly exercised
in the particular proceeding, then the court shall hear and determine such
matters. The court's order thereon is appealable, and an appeal may be taken
therefrom by either party within 30 days after the entry of the order, but not
thereafter unless the court, on good cause shown, shall extend the time for
taking an appeal. However, no appeal shall stay the further proceedings herein
prescribed unless the appeal is taken by the petitioner, or unless an order
staying further proceedings shall be entered by the trial court or by the court
to which the appeal is taken.
   (C)   If the foregoing matters are determined in favor of the petitioner and
further proceedings are not stayed, or if further proceedings are stayed and
the appeal results in a determination in favor of the petitioner, then the
court shall hear the issues raised by the petitioner's motion for taking. If
the court finds that reasonable necessity exists for taking the property in the
manner requested in the motion, the court then shall hear such evidence as it
may consider necessary and proper for a preliminary finding of just
compensation; and in its discretion, the court may appoint 3 competent and
disinterested appraisers as agents of the court to evaluate the property to
which the motion relates and to report their conclusions to the court; and
their fees shall be paid by the petitioner. The court then shall make the
preliminary finding of the amount constituting just compensation.
   (D)   The preliminary finding of just compensation, and any deposit made for
security pursuant thereto, shall not be evidence in the further proceedings to
ascertain finally the just compensation to be paid, and shall not be disclosed
in any manner to a jury impaneled in such proceedings. If appraisers have been
appointed as herein authorized, their reports shall not be evidence in further
proceedings, but the appraisers may be called as witnesses by the parties to
the proceedings.
(Ord. 6685, passed 8-14-79)
§ 38.04 DEPOSIT IN COURT; ORDER OF TAKING; POSSESSION; RENTAL; LEGAL PROCESS.
   (A)   If the petitioner deposits with the county treasurer money in the
amount preliminarily found by the court to be just compensation, the court
shall enter an order of taking, vesting in the petitioner the fee simple title
(or such lesser estate, interest, or easement, as may be required) to the
property, if such vesting has been requested, and has been found necessary by
the court, at such date as the court considers proper, and fixing a date on
which the petitioner is authorized to take possession of and to use the
property.
   (B)   If, at the request of any interested party and on his showing of undue
hardship or other good cause, the petitioner's authority to take possession of
the property is postponed for more than 10 days after the date of such vesting
of title, or more than 15 days after the entry of such order when the order
does not vest title in the petitioner, then such party shall pay to the
petitioner a reasonable rental for the property, the amount thereof to be
determined by the court. A writ of assistance, injunction, or any other
appropriate legal process or procedure shall be available to place the
petitioner in possession of the property on or after the date fixed by the
court for the taking of possession and to prevent any unauthorized interference
with possession and the petitioner's proper use of the property.
(Ord. 6685, passed 8-14-79)
§ 38.05 WITHDRAWALS BY PERSONS HAVING AN INTEREST; HEARING.
   At any time after the petitioner has taken possession of the property
pursuant to the order of taking, if an appeal has not and will not be taken
from the court's order described in § 38.03 (B), or if such appeal has been
taken and has been determined in favor of the petitioner, any party interested
in the property may apply to the court for authority to withdraw for his own
use his share (or any part thereof) of the amount preliminarily found by the
court to be just compensation, and deposited by the petitioner in accordance
with the provisions of §
38.04 (A), as such share shall have been determined by the court. The court
shall then fix a date for a hearing on the application, and shall require that
due notice of the application to be given to each party whose interest would be
affected by the withdrawal. After the hearing, the court may authorize the
withdrawal requested, or such part thereof as shall be proper, but on the
condition that the party making the withdrawal shall refund to the clerk of the
court, on the entry of a proper court order, any portion of the amount so
withdrawn which shall exceed the amount finally ascertained in the proceeding
to be just compensation (or damages, costs, expenses, or attorney fees) owing
to such party.
(Ord. 6685, passed 8-14-79)
§ 38.06 PERSONS CONTESTING THE TAKING NOT TO BE PREJUDICED.

taking any action authorized by §§
38.02 through
38.05, shall be prejudiced in any way in contesting, in later stages of the
proceedings, the amount to be finally ascertained to be just compensation.
(Ord. 6685, passed 8-14-79)
§ 38.07 INTEREST PAYMENTS.
   (A)   The petitioner shall pay, in addition to the just compensation finally
adjudged in the proceedings, interest at the rate of 6% per annum upon:
      (1)   Any excess of the just compensation so finally adjudged over the
amount preliminarily found by the court to be just compensation in accordance
with §
38.03, from the date on which the parties interested in the property
surrendered possession of the property in accordance with the order of taking,
to the date of payment of the excess by the petitioner;
      (2)   Any portion of the amount preliminarily found by the court to be
just compensation and deposited by the petitioner, to which any interested
party is entitled, if such interested party applied for authority to withdraw
such portion in accordance with §
38.05, and upon objection by the petitioner (other than on grounds that an
appeal under §
38.03 (B) is pending or contemplated), such authority was denied; interest to
be paid to such party from the date of the petitioner's deposit to the date of
payment to such party.
   (B)   When interest is allowable as provided in division (A)(1) above, no
further interest shall be allowed under the provisions of ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5,
§ 7-108 as amended, or any other law.

   If the amount withdrawn from the deposit by an interested party under the
provisions of §
38.05 exceeds the amount finally adjudged to be just compensation (or damages,
costs, expenses, and attorney's fees) due to such party, the court shall order
such party to refund the excess to the clerk of the court, and if refund is not
made within a reasonable time affixed by the court, shall enter judgment for
the excess in favor of the petitioner and against such party.
(Ord. 6685, passed 8-14-79)
§ 38.09 PROCEEDINGS; DISMISSAL; ABATEMENT.
   After the petitioner has taken possession of the property pursuant to the
order of taking, the petitioner shall have no right to dismiss the petition, or
to abandon the proceeding, as to all or any part of the property so taken,
except upon consent of all parties to the proceeding whose interest would be
affected by such dismissal or abandonment.
(Ord. 6685, passed 8-14-79)
§ 38.10 PAYMENT OF COST IF ACTION GOES AGAINST THE PETITIONER.
   If, on an appeal taken under the provisions of §
38.03, the petitioner shall be determined not to have the authority to maintain
the proceeding as to any property, which is the subject thereof, or if, with
the consent of all parties to the proceedings whose interests shall be
affected, the petitioner dismisses the petition or abandons the proceedings as
to any such property, the trial court then shall enter an order revesting the
title to the property in the parties entitled thereto, if the order of taking
vested title in the petitioner; requiring the petitioner to deliver possession
of the property to the parties entitled to the possession thereof; and making
such provision as shall be just, for the payment of damages arising out of the
petitioner's taking and use of the property, and also for costs, expenses, and
attorney's fees as provided in ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, § 7-123; and the court may
order the clerk of the court to pay such sums to the parties entitled thereto,

§ 39.05 TRAVEL POLICY AND PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Policy.
      (1)   In order to best utilize the resources available to the City,
employees are expected to use sound judgment to minimize the costs of necessary
business travel. This policy includes regulations and restrictions governing
travel expenses and shall apply to all City employees. The Mayor, at his
discretion, reserves the right to exempt an employee from the provisions
hereunder.
      (2)   All department and division heads are responsible for the
dissemination and administration of this policy within their departments, and
for monitoring travel expenses of their employees.
      (3)   All employees who travel on City business are responsible for
compliance with the requirements of this policy, and for the exercise of sound
judgment in their travel expenditures. City employees will use the most

Request and Expense form prior to any travel at City expense. The form shall
include the conference information, anticipated distance for mileage, and a per
diem request for anticipated expenses. All travel expenses paid in advance by

cost of actual expenses for gas, oil, and emergency repairs. If a private
vehicle is used, after receiving prior authorization from the department head
and Mayor, the City will pay the current IRS mileage rate at the time of travel
for the most direct route to and from the conference, seminar, meeting or other
business event (using the distance shown on mapquest or similar internet map
site), up to a maximum equal to the cost of travel by public transportation.
         (c)   The City will also pay mileage for reasonable travel to
restaurants for meals not provided with the conference, seminar, meeting, or
other business event, by the most direct route to and from the restaurant
nearest the event site.
         (d)   Employees are encouraged to travel together if they are going to
the same location or close location. If employees travel together by a private
vehicle, the City will pay mileage only to the owner of the vehicle, but the
maximum limit may be raised due to the economy of travel in this manner.
         (e)   If travel by private vehicle extends the length of the trip
beyond the time it would normally take by public transportation, the City will
not pay for meals and lodging for the extended length of stay.
         (f)   In case of a breakdown or other emergency while traveling by a
City car, the employee shall contact the department or division head
immediately to determine what should be done with the vehicle.
         (g)   If an employee needs a rental car for a conference, seminar,
meeting or other business event in a distant city, the City will pay the costs
for such car rental, including mileage. The employee shall include this expense
in estimating the cost of the trip beforehand, choose the most economical
rental car available, and provide sufficient reason on the Travel Request and
Expense form to justify the need for the car at that location.

the expense is approved in advance of the trip.
         (c)   The City will pay a higher room rate for an employee attending a
conference, seminar or other business event in a larger city (such as Chicago,
New York, Washington D.C.) if the employee has received the prior approval of
the Mayor.
      (4)   Meals and incidental expenses (M&IE).
         (a)   "Incidental expenses" include fees and tips given to hotel
attendants, transportation between places of lodging or businesses and places
where meals are taken if suitable meals cannot be obtained at the place of
lodging or conference, seminar or other business event.
         (b)   When travel is 60 miles or less (per mapquest or similar
internet map site), the per diem paid to an employee shall be $28.00 per day
(represented as $7.50 for breakfast, $7.50 for lunch, and $13.00 for dinner).
When travel is greater than 60 miles (per mapquest or similar internet map
site), the employee will be paid a per diem for meals, including taxes and
tips, and incidental expenses. The rate of per diem for travel of greater than
60 miles will be in accordance with the rate published by the U.S. General
Services Administration (GSA) (available on www.gsa.gov/perdiemin) for the
location of the conference, seminar or other business meeting. If neither the
specific trip destination city or county is listed, the closest CONUS
(Continental United States) destination listed on the GSA website will be used
to determine the M&IE per diem rate.
         (c)   If the hotel, or conference, seminar or other business meeting
provides a meal or meals, the amount of per diem associated with such meal or
meals will be deducted from the per diem provided to the employee. If the
employee has dietary needs or restrictions that will require a meal different
from that provided by the hotel or conference, seminar or other business
meeting, the employee shall note that on the Travel Request and Expense form
submitted prior to the travel. The City will reimburse meals taken in lieu of
the meal provided in order to meet dietary needs or restrictions. The cost of
any meal taken in lieu of that provided by the hotel or conference, seminar or
other business meeting which is not related to dietary needs or restrictions
shall not be paid or reimbursed by the City.
         (d)   The City will reimburse actual charges for incidental expenses
only when: documentation of actual charges is provided; and, the incidental
portion of the M&IE daily per diem rate is deducted from the employee's total
per diem for the particular day or days.
      (5)   Other expenses.

charges pertaining to an approved conference, seminar or similar business trip,

above), including intra-city taxi, airport bus, tolls, parking, pre-approved

      (6)   Receipts will be required for all expenses and shall be turned in
to the Finance Division upon return from the conference, seminar or other
business meeting.

agreement.

shall be based on the length of continuous service, starting with the first day

resulting from an on-the-job injury covered by the City’s worker compensation
shall not be deemed to be an interruption of service. Absence from work due to

to accept a promotion to an Executive Management position or Manager/
Superintendent position, or when, by mutual agreement between the City and the
individual, the employee retires from their current position to accept a new
position for the City. For vacation purposes, reinstated employees shall be

service to the City.

supervisor prior to the requested time off and so as not to disrupt the
services provided by such department. Each day of vacation eligibility shall
represent 8 hours of time off available to the employee. Employees shall
schedule vacation time off in no less than 2-hour increments. Vacations must be
approved in writing by the employee’s department head or if designated, by
their immediate supervisor. Employees shall initiate their request by using an
electronic “Request for Leave of Absence/Time Off” form which shall be made
available on the City’s network shared drive for such purposes. If an employee
is reinstated with no break in continuous service to the City, the employee may
utilize their total years of City service when calculating eligible vacation
accrual.
      (8)   No vacation leave shall be taken prior to the first 12 months of
employment and earned vacation time must be taken by the employee within one
calendar year from the date it is earned. Vacation time cannot be accumulated
and carried from one 12-month period to the next, except in very rare cases
where the employee is asked to delay their vacation at the request of the
department head. For vacation purposes the employee’s anniversary of their date
of hire shall be used. The department’s time keeper shall determine and
maintain all official records of vacation eligibility.
      (9)   Each day of vacation eligibility shall be equal to 8 hours of pay
at the employee’s then current hourly rate of pay.
      (10)   Any employee who quits, retires, dies, or is otherwise terminated
from their employment with the City, shall be paid for any earned and unused
current vacation entitlement as of the date of separation.

provided herein.

hour work period per month as earned time leave. Regular full-time employee’s
earned time leave shall be credited on December 1 of each year, and shall be
accumulated from year-to-year as hereinafter provided.
            2.   Scheduling and use of earned time. Earned time use requests

leave for such sickness or injury and shall notify the supervisor or department
head at the earliest reasonable time but not more than 15 minutes after the

the city’s written policy is provided to all employees upon initial employment,
provided to anyone upon request or when the policy is updated due to amendments
of the State statute.
            4.   Purchase of unused earned time. On or before the second pay
period of the month of December of each year, the City shall purchase from each
regular full-time employee any of the unused earned time leave days which the
employee had to their credit on the previous November 30. The rate of purchase
shall be at the employee’s then hourly base wage. This subsection shall be
subject to the provisions of subsection 6. below.
            5.   Refund of excess earned time leave for part-year employment.
In the event that any regular full-time employee is voluntarily or
involuntarily terminated as an employee of the City, earned time leave days
shall be treated as if earned at the rate of one day per month commencing on
December 1 prior to termination. If any earned time leave days are taken in
excess of this rate prior to termination, then the employee shall refund to the
City upon termination an amount equal to such excess earned time leave days at
such employee’s then annual hourly base wage. The City shall have the right to
collect such refund out of any monies owed by the City to such employee upon
termination, and the City shall have the right to file suit to recover from
such employee any shortage or deficiency remaining after any such set-off.
            6.    Accumulation of unused and unpurchased earned time.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 4. above, any regular full-time
employee who has one or more earned time leave days to their credit on November
30, may elect to add such unused earned time leave days, which have not been
purchased under subsection 4. above, to their earned time bank, subject to the
maximum accumulation provisions under subsection 7. below.
            7.   Earned time bank. Unused sick leave prior to December 1, 1987
and any unused and unpurchased earned time leave thereafter shall be
established as the employee’s earned time bank, which shall not exceed a
maximum accumulation of 120 days. A regular full-time employee who retires from
employment with the City shall receive an amount equal to one-third of their
then earned time bank, not to exceed 40 days. Use of the earned time bank for
injury or illness will be permitted to the maximum limit of the employee’s
accumulation after all then current earned time leave has been exhausted.
            8.   Method of recording partial use of earned time leave days. For
the purpose of recording the partial use of earned time days the following
system shall be used:
Annual allotment (12 days hours of earned time leave    =   96.00
One full day (full shift hours)   =    8.00 One half day (8:00-12:00 or 1:00-4:
30)   =    4.00
1 work hour (60 minutes)      =    1.00
1/2 work hour (30 minutes)      =    .50
1/4 work hour (15 minutes)      =    .25
Earned time taken shall not be recorded in increments less than .25 hour.

Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF) the balance of the earned time bank not paid
to the employee upon retirement shall be considered as unused sick days.

temporary employment agency shall receive paid personal time per State Statute

and
            2.   Manager/Superintendent Positions and Other Non-Union Positions

practical. Promotions in every case must involve a definite increase in duties
and responsibilities and shall not be made merely for the purpose of an
increase in compensation. Such promotions shall be subject to a 30 day

§ 39.11 DISCIPLINARY ACTION.
   Whenever an employee’s performance, attitude, work habits, or personal
conduct at any time fall below an acceptable level, the supervisor and/or
department head shall inform the employee promptly and specifically give
counsel, guidance, and assistance. This will include any actions of employees
which are in noncompliance with departmental rules and regulations, City
policies, and ordinances. If appropriate and justified, a reasonable period of
time for improvement may be allowed before initiating disciplinary action. In
some cases, the circumstances may justify immediate action; the action to be
taken depends on the seriousness of the incident and the employee’s past
performance and conduct.
   (A)   The following shall be considered as offenses punishable by reprimand,
suspension, or dismissal.
      (1)   Theft, negligence, or destruction of any City property or
resources, including, but not limited to, vehicles.
      (2)   Incompetency, inefficiency, negligence, or misrepresentation in the
performance of duty.

      (10)   Noncompliance with departmental work rules and regulations.
   (B)   Reprimand. In situations where an oral warning has not resulted in the
expected improvement or where more severe action is warranted, the employee’s
supervisor or department head may issue a written reprimand. A copy of the
written reprimand will be presented to the employee and a copy placed in the
employee’s personnel record.
   (C)   Suspension. In situations where a written reprimand has not resulted
in the expected improvement, or where more severe action is warranted, the
department head may suspend the employee without pay for reasons of misconduct,
negligence, inefficiency, insubordination, disloyalty, unauthorized absence, or
any violation listed above in (A)(1) through (10). The employee shall be
furnished with a written notice following this action stating the reason for
the suspension. An employee not covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement
may appeal the decision of suspension as outlined in §
39.12. An employee covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall follow
the procedure outlined in such agreement for disputing the imposition of the
suspension. Any suspension imposed, and the reasons therefor, shall be
documented in the employee’s personnel record.
   (D)   Dismissal. A department head may seek the dismissal of any City
employee. Reasons for dismissal may include, but shall not be limited to,
reasons of misconduct, negligence, inefficiency, insubordination, disloyalty,

where alternate personnel actions are not appropriate. The employee may appeal
the decision of dismissal as outlined under §
39.12.

§ 39.12 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Definition. As used in this section, a “GRIEVANCE” is the
dissatisfaction which an employee feels when he believes that he has not been
treated fairly concerning his hours of work, vacation, holiday eligibility, and
other terms and conditions of employment, except for salaries and salary
increases. “GRIEVANCE HEARING OFFICER” is any hearing officer serving as a part
of the City’s Administrative Adjudication System.
   (B)   Grievance hearing officer appointed. A hearing officer shall be
appointed by the Mayor for the purpose of conducting a grievance procedure
hearing.
   (C)   Human Resources Manager’s role. In addition to serving as secretary
during the grievance hearing procedure, the City’s Human Resources Manager
shall maintain records of all grievances filed by employees, as well as a
record of all responses and actions taken for each separate grievance. In this
regard, the aggrieved employee, his supervisor and/or department head shall
keep the Human Resources Manager informed of each step and each action by
providing copies of written documents or a memorandum of information as
appropriate.
   (D)   Procedure. An internal grievance procedure shall be established as
outlined herein for the purposes of allowing each grievance to be heard
adequately, and so that decisions can be based on the facts and circumstances
of each individual case.
      (1)   Employees who have a grievance arising out of their employment have
the right to have their grievance heard. A grievance must be submitted in
writing, signed by the employee, and presented personally or through an
authorized representative to the employee’s immediate supervisor within ten
calendar days of the event which has caused the grievance to be filed. Failure
to do so automatically abandons the grievance. The supervisor will make every
effort to resolve the grievance at this level. The supervisor’s reply must be
in writing, and returned to the employee within three working days after
receipt of the grievance.
      (2)   If settlement is not resolved at the supervisory level, the
aggrieved employee may carry it to his department head within five working days
from the receipt of the supervisor’s decision. The department head must submit
a written reply within three working days after receipt of the grievance.
      (3)   If settlement is not reached at the department head level, the
grievance may be carried to the mayor within five working days from receipt of
the department head’s decision. The mayor shall advise the employee of his
decision in the matter in writing within five working days. If the employee is
not satisfied with the mayor’s response, the matter may be referred within five
working days to the City’s Human Resources Manager with the request to schedule
the matter before the grievance hearing officer. The hearing officer shall hear
all sides of the case and make its determination within five working days after
the hearing at which the review of the matter has been completed, unless a
postponement is agreed to by the City and the employee. The determination of
the hearing officer shall be final. The employee shall be notified of the
hearing officer’s determination within three working days after the decision is
made.
      (4)   Throughout the procedure, each party shall provide the City’s Human
Resources Manager with copies of the grievance and all related correspondence.
The City’s Human Resources Manager shall provide technical assistance
throughout the process and shall refrain from rendering any decision reserved
to the supervisor, department head, or mayor.
      (5)   In any case, employees shall be assured freedom from restraint,
interference, discrimination, and reprisal arising from any grievance
presented.
   (E)   Grievance procedure not applicable to union employees. The grievance
procedure provided in this section shall not apply to any employee who is a
member of a collective bargaining unit which has a contract with the City
containing a different grievance procedure.
   (F)   Discrimination follow-up. Any employee who feels that he has been
discriminated against because of age, race, color, sex, religion, marital
status, sexual orientation or national origin may seek the assistance of the
City’s Human Relations Commission in settling his grievance.

bargaining unit is in conflict with a provision of this chapter, then the
collective bargaining unit provision shall apply. With regards to hiring,
termination, and promotions within the Police and Fire departments, the rules
established by the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners shall apply to those
employees so affected.

meaning.
      (1)   “DISABLED OR RETIRED EMPLOYEE.” An employee of the City who becomes
eligible for immediate pension benefits, but is not required to immediately
receive those benefits, under either the Illinois Municipal Retirement Pension
System, or the Illinois Police Pension System, or the Illinois Firefighter
Pension System (ILCS Chapter 40, Act 5), hereinafter collectively referred to
as the “Illinois Pension Code.”
      (2)   “RETIREMENT OR DISABILITY PERIOD.” Shall mean the period:
         (a)   Which begins on the day the employee is removed from the City’s
payroll because of the occurrence of any of the following events:
            1.   The employee retires with an attained age and accumulated
creditable service which together qualify the employee for immediate receipt of
retirement pension benefits under any of the provisions of the Illinois Pension
Code; or
            2.   The employee’s disability is established under any of the
provisions of the Illinois Pension Code; and
         (b)   Which ends on the first to occur of any of the following events:
            1.   The employee’s reinstatement or reentry into active service as
an employee of the City, if such reinstatement or reentry causes a suspension
or termination of pension benefits under any of the provisions of the Illinois
Pension Code;
            2.   The employee’s exercise of any refund option available under
any of the provisions of the Illinois Pension Code;
            3.   The employee’s loss of any benefits pursuant to the Illinois
Pension Code; or
            4.   The employee’s death or, if at the time of the employee’s
death the employee is survived by a spouse who, in that capacity is entitled to
receive a surviving spouse’s monthly pension or annuity pursuant to the
Illinois Pension Code, then the death or remarriage of that spouse.
         (c)   So long as any required premiums for continued group coverage
are paid in accordance with the provisions of the group plan, an election made
pursuant to this section shall provide continued group coverage for an employee
throughout the retirement or disability period of the employee. Unless the
employee otherwise elects and subject to any other provisions of the group plan
which relate either to the provision or to the termination of dependents’
coverage and which are not inconsistent with this section, the group plan shall
also apply to any dependents of the employee who are covered under the group
plan on the day immediately preceding the day on which the retirement or
disability period of the employee begins.
   (B)   Premiums for insurance.
      (1)   In the event such retired employee elects to remain a participant
in the group medical insurance plan of the City upon retirement, the City shall
pay so much of said retiree’s first three monthly premium contributions, which
would otherwise be payable by the retiree, as determined under the following
rules:
         (a)   If the retiree is due retirement pay for 15 or fewer days (but
not less than one day), one month’s premium will be paid by the City;
         (b)   If the retiree is due retirement pay for more than 15 days, but
not more than 30 days, two months’ premiums will be paid by the City;
         (c)   If the retiree is due retirement pay for more than 30 days to
the maximum of 40 days, three months’ premiums will be paid by the City.
      (2)   Thereafter, continued group coverage shall be provided to an
eligible retired or disabled employee in accordance with this section, with the
premium to be paid by the retired or disabled employee. The premium rate to be
paid by the retired or disabled employee shall be the rate charged to the City
under the group plan for their coverage. However, in the case of a full-time
police officer or firefighter who suffers a catastrophic injury or is killed in
the line of duty shall receive the benefits so allowed by the Illinois Compiled
State Statutes. No distinction or discrimination in the amount or rate of
premiums or in any waiver of premium or other benefit provision shall be made
between continued group coverage elected pursuant to this section and
equivalent coverage provided to employees under the group plan other than
pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the group plan provides for a
reduction in benefits and premium for covered employees and covered dependents
who become eligible for Medicare, this provision shall apply to persons
electing continued coverage under this section.
      (3)   If the employee elects to continue coverage as provided in this
section, it shall be the obligation, of the employee to pay the monthly premium
to the City on the first business day of each calendar month.
      (4)   Any employee who elects continued coverage under this section, but
who fails to pay the monthly premium payment required hereunder within 10
business days after it is due shall be deemed in default. Each late premium
payment shall include a delinquency charge of 5% of the amount of the monthly
premium or $5, whichever is the greater. The City shall notify any person who
is in default by certified mail, return receipt requested, that he/she shall
have a period of 15 days from the date the notice is mailed to cure the default
by the payment of the monthly premium plus delinquency charge within such time.
In the event that any person shall fail to cure the default within such time,
the City shall have the right and remedy to file suit to collect the amount of
the unpaid monthly premium, delinquent charge, and reasonable attorney’s fees
and costs of litigation, and the court shall include in the judgment a
declaration that the rights of the person sued under this section are then and
thereafter terminated upon entry of the judgment.
      (5)   Police officers and firefighters who are eligible to receive an
immediate pension under the police or firelighters pension system shall be
entitled to designate on the statement of election that the total monthly
premium be deducted by the respective pension fund from any monthly pension
payment payable to or on behalf of the police officer or firefighter. The
premiums will be remitted by such pension funds to the City.
   (C)   Election to continue coverage. Within 15 days of the beginning of the
retirement or disability period of any employee who is entitled to elect
continued coverage under this section, the City shall give written notice to
the employee in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested. Such
notice shall be sent to the employee’s last known place of residence. This
notice shall set forth:
      (1)   A statement inquiring whether the employee wishes to continue such
group health coverage.
      (2)   The amount of the monthly premium, including a statement of the
portion attributable to any dependent’s coverage which the employee may elect,
and including a statement of the portion of the required premium which is not
borne by the City.

personally, or by certified mail, return receipt required, within 15 days after
having received it. Continued coverage in this City’s group plan as provided in
this sections shall relate back to the beginning of the employee’s retirement
or disability period.
   (D)   Coverage.
      (1)   The amendment, renewal, or extension of any group plan affected by
this section shall be deemed to be issuance of a new group plan for purposes of
this section.
      (2)   There shall be no distinction or discrimination in the benefit
provisions for continued group coverage elected pursuant to this section by:
         (a)   Disabled or retired non- union employees and equivalent benefit
provisions provided to active non-union employees under the group plan.
         (b)   Disabled or retired firefighters and equivalent benefit
provisions provided to active firefighters under the group plan.
         (c)   Disabled or retired police officers and equivalent benefit
provisions provided to active police officers under the group plan.
         (d)   Disabled or retired persons who were formerly covered by a
collective bargaining agreement between the City and municipal workers, Local
703 and equivalent benefits provisions provided to active employees covered by
a collective bargaining agreement between the City and said union.
Other provisions to this section can be found in ILCS Ch. 40, Act 5. Any
changes in the state statutes or it the City ordinances may change this policy.

§ 39.16 POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   Statement of policy. Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of
Chapter 95 of the City of Danville Code of Ordinances. All employees of the
City should be aware of the City’s prohibition regarding any form of sexual
harassment in the workplace. All employees must be allowed to work in an
environment free from sexual overtones and intimidation.
   (B)   Definitions.
      “SEXUAL HARASSMENT.” Includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when:
(a) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of an individual’s employment; (b) submission to or rejection of
such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions
affecting that individual; or (c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of
unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.
   (C)   Prohibited conduct. No employee shall directly or indirectly: (a)
threaten or insinuate that another employee’s refusal to submit to sexual
advances will adversely affect that employee’s relationship with the City, work
status evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties, or any other condition
of employment; (b) promise, imply or grant preferential treatment in connection
with another employee engaging in sexual conduct; or, (c) abuse the dignity of
another employee through insulting or degrading sexual remarks or conduct.
   (D)   Reporting of incident.
      (1)   Any incident of perceived sexual harassment shall be reported as
quickly as possible, in confidence to an immediate supervisor, the Human
Resources Manager, or the Human Relations Manager. The employee is encouraged
to seek the assistance of others, if it is necessary in order to be able to
report any incident perceived to be sexual harassment. Every effort will be
made to promptly investigate any allegation of sexual harassment in as
confidential a manner as possible, and appropriate action will be taken where
warranted.
      (2)   In addition, any incident of perceived sexual harassment may be
reported to the Illinois Department of Human Rights and the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
   (E)   Discipline. Anyone who is determined, after an investigation, to have
engaged in sexual harassment in violation of this policy will be subject to
disciplinary action up to and including termination. If the responsible party
is found to be someone not employed by the City who does business with the
City, appropriate action may be taken to terminate the business relationship
and prohibit the responsible party from doing further business with the City.
In addition, because false accusations regarding sexual harassment can have
serious effects on the person or persons accused, any person who deliberately
and in bad faith makes a false accusation of sexual harassment shall be subject
to appropriate disciplinary action when warranted, up to and including
termination.
   (F)   Retaliation. Retaliation, reprisals, or discrimination against an
employee for good-faith reporting of a perceived incident of sexual harassment
is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated by the City.
   (G)   Questions. Employees are encouraged to raise any questions they may
have regarding this policy with the Human Resources Manager or the Human
Relations Manager.

   (A)   Policy. Pursuant to the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act and the
Illinois Drug-Free Workplace Act, it is the goal of the City to provide a safe
and drug-free work environment for our employees. With this goal in mind and
because of the serious safety and performance consequences of drug abuse in the
workplace, we hereby establish this policy for all City employees.
   (B)   The City of Danville explicitly prohibits:
      (1)   The use, possession, solicitation for, or sale of narcotics or
other illegal drugs, alcohol, or prescription medication without a prescription
on City property or while performing any work-related duties.
      (2)   Being impaired or under the influence of legal or illegal drugs or
alcohol while not performing job-related duties or away from City property, if
such impairment or influence adversely affects the employee’s work performance,
the safety of the employee or of others, or puts the City of Danville’s
reputation at risk.
      (3)   Possession, use, solicitation for, or sale of legal or illegal
drugs or alcohol while not performing job-related duties or away from City
property, if such activity or involvement adversely affects the employee’s work
performance, the safety of the employee or of others, or puts the City of
Danville’s reputation at risk.
      (4)   The presence of any detectable amount of prohibited substances in
the employee’s system while at work or while performing job-related duties.
“PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES” include illegal drugs, alcohol, or prescription drugs
not taken in accordance with a prescription given to an employee.
   (C)   The City shall maintain a drug-free and/or an alcohol-free awareness
program warning employees of the dangers of drugs in the workplace, and shall
distribute this policy on maintaining a drug-free workplace and the penalties
that may be imposed upon employees for violation of this policy or other
applicable policies, rules, or regulations. Each person employed with the City
will be provided a copy of this policy and upon employment, will be asked to
sign a copy of this policy to indicate the employee’s understanding of its
content.
   (D)   Each employee will be notified that as a condition of employment with
the City, the employee:
      (1)   Must abide by the terms of this policy;
      (2)   Must notify the City of any conviction for a drug-related or
alcohol-related offense occurring within or outside the workplace no later than
five days after such conviction. Upon notification, the department head, within
30 days of receiving notice, shall recommend to the Mayor:
         (a)   Taking appropriate disciplinary action against such an employee,
up to and including termination; or
         (b)   Require such employee, at their own costs, to participate
satisfactorily in a substance abuse or rehabilitation program approved for such
purposes by a federal, state, or local health, law enforcement or other
appropriate agency.
   (E)   Drug Testing. City of Danville employees may be subject to a drug test
under the following circumstances:
      (1)   For Cause Testing. The City of Danville may ask an employee to
submit to a drug test at any time it appears that the employee may be under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, including but not limited to the following
circumstances: evidence of drugs or alcohol on or about the employee’s person
or in the employee’s vicinity; unusual conduct on the employee’s part that
suggests impairment of influence of drugs or alcohol; negative performance
patterns or excessive and unexplained absenteeism or tardiness.
      (2)   Post Accident Testing. Any employee involved in a job-related
accident causing property damage or injury, or any injury event, under
circumstances that suggest possible use of drugs or alcohol in the accident or
injury event may be asked by either the department head or Risk Manager, but
only with approval by the Mayor, to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test. This
clause may pertain to damage to any property and therefore is not inclusive of
only City property.
      (3)   If an employee is tested for drugs or alcohol outside of the
employment context and the results indicate a violation of this policy, the
employee may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and including
termination. In such a case, the employee will be given the opportunity to
explain the circumstances to the department head prior to forwarding a

is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct
of their affairs.
      (5)   No continuances shall be authorized by the hearing officer except
in cases where a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of
the respondent. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any
continuance authorized by a hearing officer shall not exceed 25 days.

chapter shall be recorded.

CHARGES AND BILLING PROCEDURES
§ 51.35 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   User charges. The sewer service charge for the use of, provision of,
and for service supplied by the wastewater and storm sewer facilities within or
maintained by the City to users shall consist of a monthly user charge for
operation and maintenance, replacement, bond retirement, and all other costs
and expenses. All users shall pay this charge, whether or not the unit or
structure is occupied. Monthly user charges shall be according to TABLE I
below.
TABLE I
Monthly Sewer User Charges
User Class Minimum Monthly Base User Charge
TABLE I
Monthly Sewer User Charges
User Class                          Minimum Monthly Base User Charge
Residential - Single Family         $29.75
Residential - Multi-Unit (per unit) $17.00
Commercial                          $42.50
Institutional/Governmental          $42.50
Industrial                          $42.50
In addition to the base user charge, any non-residential user shall pay a
monthly surcharge on any usage over 10 CCF (7,480 gallons). This surcharge
shall be based on metered water consumption rounded up to the nearest CCF (748
gallons). Calculation of the surcharge rate shall be based upon the Single
Family Residential Base Fee / 7 CCF (5,236 gallons) of usage.
As of October 1, 2021:
   Surcharge rate = $29.75 / 7 CCF
   Surcharge rate = $4.25 / CCF
   Surcharge rate = $5.68 / 1,000 gallons
 
   (B)   User Charge Annual Adjustment. All user charges shall be subject to
automatic annual increases for a 4-year period. The Single Family Residential
Minimum Monthly Base User Charge shall be subject to an automatic $1.00 per
month annual increase for the period beginning on April 1, 2022. All annual
adjustments for all users shall be calculated as follows:
Single Family Residential User Base Charge = Prior Year Base Charge + $1.00
   April 1, 2022 = $29.75 + $1.00 = $30.75
Multi-Unit Residential (per unit) Base Charge = 4 CCF / 7 CCF x Single Family
Residential User Base Charge
   April 1, 2022 = 4 ÷ 7 x $30.75 = $17.57
All non-residential User Classes Base Charge = 10 CCF ÷ 7 CCF x Single Family
Residential User Base Charge
   April 1, 2022 = 10 ÷ 7 x $30.75 = $43.93
Surcharge Rate = Single Family Residential User Base Charge / 7 CCF
   April 1, 2022 = $30.75 / 7 CCF
      = $4.39 / CCF
      = $5.87 / 1,000 gallons
   (C)   Cancellation of Sewer Service. Upon completion of City inspection of
sewer line abandonment for any permitted demolition performed in accordance
with City Ordinances, policies, and standards, the property owner may request
the City cease billing of sanitary sewer charges at the end of the month. Such
request shall be made to the entity performing sewer billing on behalf of the
City, at which time the City will authorize cessation of sewer billing. Such a
request shall be the responsibility of the property owner and in no case shall
the City or the party providing billing and collection services be responsible
for refund of sewer charges prior a billing cessation request of the property
owner.
   (D)   Storm and Sanitary Sewer Fund Revenue Policies. Sewer user rates shall
be reviewed annually in accordance with Chapter 30 Administrative Provisions, §
30.08 Financial Policy, of the City’s Code of Ordinances.
   (E)   Use of water for irrigation. Facilities and properties utilizing
irrigation for lawns, landscaping plants, or outdoor agricultural production,
which do not result in discharges to the storm or sanitary sewer systems, shall
have such uses exempt from sewer charges provided that such use has a
permanently mounted separate water meter which is owned by the local water
utility and designated solely for such usage. Any water usage located within
structures shall not be eligible for this exemption. Such an exemption shall
not reduce the minimum monthly base user charge.
   (F)   Non-residential Rate Reduction. In the event that a non-residential
property meets the following criteria, it shall be eligible for a reduction
from the Minimum Monthly Base User Charge as shown in TABLE I.
      1.   Land Area of less than 0.25 acres (10,890 square feet), which shall
include any adjoining lots and nearby lots used for parking or other purposes
related to operation of the business.
      2.   Monthly water usage of less than 7 CCF (5,236 gallons).
      3.   Land area as described in subsection (F)(1) is less than 75%
impervious (gravel or paved parking, rooftops, curbs, equipment pads,
sidewalks, patios, etc.; landscaping gravel in landscaping areas shall not be
considered impervious).
   The reduced rate shall be equal to the Residential Single Family Residential
Minimum Monthly Base User Charge. To request such a reduction, the account
owner shall submit a written request, including supporting information
necessary to determine compliance with conditions (F)(1)-(3) above, to the
Director. The Director shall review and make a determination, notifying the
requesting party of the final determination.

decision. If the decision is that the charges and penalties are due and owing,
the letter shall also establish a deadline for payment of the charges and

description of the real estate sufficient for the identification thereof; the
amount of the delinquency; and, the date upon which such amount became

recording charges.

prepaid. If the owner pays the solid waste collection charges which are
delinquent within the 21 days, the owner shall not be liable for the penalties
assessed pursuant to division (B) above. If the owner fails to pay the solid
waste collection charges which are delinquent within the 21 days, such owner
shall be liable for the penalties assessed pursuant to division (B) above.
   (H)   The City shall have the power to foreclose the lien created by this
section in the same manner and with the same effect as in the foreclosure of
mortgages on real estate.

or indirect benefit from the solid waste collection services, in a civil action
to recover money due for such services plus reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs of suit; provided however, that the City shall give notice of its
intention to bring such action to the owner or owners of record by regular mail
not less than seven days prior to filing such civil action. Judgment in a civil
action brought by the City to recover or collect such charges shall not operate

judgment. Only satisfaction of the judgment or the filing of a release and
satisfaction of lien shall release said lien.
   (J)   The City shall add interest at a rate of 6% per annum on all liens

different colored lights or color lighted arrows, successively one at a time or
in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in §
70.012, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal
is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal,
unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in §
70.012, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall then start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Flashing yellow arrow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a flashing yellow arrow indication may
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
arrow and shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a flashing yellow indication, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in §
70.012, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk
that crosses the lane or lanes used to depart the intersection by traffic
controlled by the flashing yellow arrow indication. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
   (D)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Except as provided in divisions (D)(3) and (D)(4) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown.
      (2)   Except as provided in divisions (D)(3) and (D)(4) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the
intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering
the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
shown.
      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and the city
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by division (D)(l) or (D)(2)
of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways. The driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)   In municipalities with less than 2,000,000 inhabitants, after
stopping as required by divisions (D)(1) or (D)(2), the driver of a motorcycle
or bicycle, facing a steady red signal which fails to change to a green signal
within a reasonable period of time, not less than 120 seconds, because of a
signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the arrival of
the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle's size or weight, shall have the
right to proceed, after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic facing a
green signal, subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign as required by state law.
      (5)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in §
70.012, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone
shall not enter the roadway.
   (E)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made; or, in the absence of
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

the roadway in the direction of this signal, but any pedestrian who has partly
completed his crossing on the "Walk" signal or upraised palm symbol shall

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the

where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway
before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to

§ 71.012 NO-PASSING ZONES.
   (A)   The city council is authorized to determine those portions of any
highway within the city where overtaking and passing or driving on the left of
the roadway would be especially hazardous, and may by appropriate signs or
markings on the roadway indicate the beginning and end of the zones. Upon
request of a local school board, the city council shall determine whether a
hazardous situation exists at a particular location and warrants a no-passing
zone. If the city council determines that a no-passing zone is warranted, the
school board and the city council shall share equally the cost of designating
the no-passing zone by signs and markings and when signs or markings are in
place and clearly visible to an ordinarily observant person, every driver of a
vehicle shall obey the directions thereof.
   (B)   Where signs or markings are in place to define a no-passing zone as
set forth in division (A) no driver may at any time drive on the left side of
the roadway within the no-passing zone or on the left side of any pavement

   Whenever any roadway has been divided into 2 or more clearly marked lanes
for traffic, the following rules, in addition to all others consistent
herewith, shall apply.
   (A)   A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a
single lane, and shall not be moved from the lane until the driver has first
ascertained that the movement can be made with safety.
   (B)   Upon a roadway which is divided into 3 lanes and provides for 2-way
movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane except
when overtaking and passing another vehicle traveling in the same direction
when the center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or in
preparation for making a left turn, or where the center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the same direction that the vehicle
is proceeding, and the allocation is designated by official traffic-control
devices.
   (C)   Official traffic-control devices may be erected directing specific
traffic to use a designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by
traffic moving in a particular direction, regardless of the center of the
roadway, and drivers of vehicles shall obey the directions of every such
device. On multilane controlled-access highways with 3 or more lanes in one
direction, or on any multilaned highway with 2 or more lanes in one direction,
the department may designate lanes of traffic to be used by different types of
motor vehicles. Drivers must obey lane designation signing except when it is
necessary to use a different lane to make a turning maneuver.
   (D)   Official traffic-control devices may be installed prohibiting the
changing of lanes on sections of roadway, and drivers of vehicles shall obey
the directions of every such device.

   (A)   The driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more
closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of the
vehicles, and the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.
   (B)   The driver of any truck or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle when
traveling upon a roadway outside of a business or residence district, and which
is following another truck or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle shall,
whenever conditions permit, leave sufficient space so that an overtaking
vehicle may enter and occupy the space without danger, except that this shall
not prevent a truck or motor vehicle drawing another vehicle from overtaking
and passing any vehicle or combination of vehicles.
   (C)   Motor vehicles being driven upon any roadway outside of a business or
residence district in a caravan or motorcade, whether or not towing other
vehicles, shall be so operated as to allow sufficient space between each
vehicle or combination of vehicles so as to enable any other vehicle to enter
and occupy the space without danger. This provision shall not apply to funeral
processions.

SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED
§ 71.035 OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN OR RAILROAD TRACK
EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing, where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet
from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall not proceed until the tracks
are clear and he or she can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall
apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and the train, by reason of its speed or
nearness to the crossing, is an immediate hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
      (6)   Whenever a person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing where the driver is not always required to stop but must slow down,
the person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad
track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the
circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall slow down within 50 feet
but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not
proceed until he or she checks that the tracks are clear of an approaching
train or railroad track equipment.
   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around, or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (C)   When stop signs are erected at railroad grade crossings, the driver of
any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the
nearest rail of the railroad, and shall proceed only upon exercising due care.
   (D)   (1)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck
signs, without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing
gates, or a human flagman giving the signal of the approach or passage of a
train or railroad track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience
to the railroad crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed
reasonable for the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety,
at a clearly marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not
less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed
until he or she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a
railroad crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track
equipment after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or
interference is prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-
way.
      (2)   No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to
negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient
undercarriage clearance.
   (E)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section.
      (1)   A violation of this section is a petty offense for which a fine of
$500 shall be imposed for a first violation, and a fine of $1,000 shall be
imposed for a second or subsequent violation. The court may impose 25 hours of
community service in place of the $500 fine for the first violation.
      (2)   For a second or subsequent violation, the Secretary of State may
suspend the driving privileges of the offender for a minimum of six months.
   (F)   Corporate authorities of municipal corporations regulating operators

   (A)    It is unlawful for any person to operate any motor vehicle of the
second division, except a truck tractor, to which this section is applicable,
upon any highway of this city unless the vehicle is equipped with rear fender
splash guards of either the contour type or the flap type which comply with the
specifications provided in this section for the type of splash guards used on
the vehicle, and which are so attached as to prevent the splashing of mud or
water upon the windshield of other motor vehicles.
   (B)   Specifications for contour type splash guards. When contour type rear
fender splash guards are used, they shall contour the wheel in such a manner
that the relationship of the inside surface of any splash guard to the tread
surface of the tire or wheel shall be relatively parallel, both laterally and
across the wheel, at least throughout the top 90° of the rear 180° of the wheel
surface; provided on vehicles which have a clearance of less than five inches
between the top of the tire or wheel and that part of the body of the vehicle
directly above the tire or wheel when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal
capacity, the curved portion of the splash guard need only extend from a point
directly behind the center of the rear axle and to the rear of the wheel
surface upwards to within at least two inches of the bottom line of the body
when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. There shall be a downward
extension of the curved surface which shall end not more than 12 inches from
the ground when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. This downward
extension shall be part of the curved surface or attached directly to the
curved surface, but it need not contour the wheel. Contour type splash guards
shall be wide enough to cover the full tread width of the tire or tires being
protected, and shall be installed not more than six inches from the tread
surface of the tire or wheel when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal
capacity. The splash guard shall have a lip or flange on its outside edge to
minimize side throw and splash. The lip or flange shall extend toward the
center of the wheel, and shall be perpendicular to and extend not less than two
inches below the inside or bottom surface line or plane of the guard. Contour
type splash guards may be constructed of either a rigid or flexible material,
but shall be attached in such a manner that, regardless of movement either by
the splash guards or the vehicle, the splash guards will retain their general
parallel relationship to the tread surface of the tire or wheel under all
ordinary operating conditions.
   (C)     The slow-moving vehicle emblem required by divisions (A) and (B)
must meet the specifications and mounting requirements established by the
department. The specifications and mounting requirements shall be based on the

or the plate displayed on that vehicle does not cover the weight of the
vehicle, the weight of the vehicle shall be covered by the third tow truck
plate issued to the owner or operator of the tow truck and temporarily affixed
to the vehicle being towed. If a roll-back carrier is registered and being used
as a tow truck, however, the license plate or plates for the tow truck must
cover the gross vehicle weight, including any load carried on the bed of the
roll-back carrier.
      (3)   The Department may by rule or regulation prescribe additional
requirements. However, nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a tow-truck under
instructions of a police officer from legally clearing a disabled vehicle, that
may be in violation of weight limitations of this chapter, from the roadway to
the berm or shoulder of the highway. If in the opinion of the police officer
that location is unsafe, the officer is authorized to have the disabled vehicle
towed to the nearest place of safety.
      (4)   For the purpose of this division (D) gross vehicle weight rating,
or GVWR, shall mean the value specified by the manufacturer as the loaded
weight of the tow truck.
   (E)   No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with pneumatic tires
shall be operated, unladen or with load, upon the highways of this city in
violation of the provisions of any permit issued under the provisions of §§
74.125  through
74.143 .
   (F)   No vehicle or combination of vehicles with pneumatic tires may be
operated, unladen or with load, when the total weight on the road surface
exceeds the following: 20,000 pounds on a single axle; 34,000 pounds on a
tandem axle with no axle within the tandem exceeding 20,000 pounds; 80,000
pounds gross weight for vehicle combinations of five or more axles; or a total
weight on a group of two or more consecutive axles in excess of that weight
produced by the application of the following formula:
   W = 500 times the sum of (LN divided by N-1) + 12N + 36
   Where "W" equals overall total weight on any group of two or more
consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, "L" equals the distance measured
to the nearest foot between extremes of any group of two or more consecutive
axles, and "N" equals the number of axles in the group under consideration.
      (1)    The above formula when expressed in tabular form results in
allowable loads as follows:
Distance measured to
the nearest foot       Maximum load in pounds carried on any group of 2 or more
between the extremes   consecutive axles
of any group of 2 or
more consecutive axles
Feet                   Two axles Three axles Four axles Five axles Six axles
Distance measured to
the nearest foot       Maximum load in pounds carried on any group of 2 or more
between the extremes   consecutive axles
of any group of 2 or
more consecutive axles

* If the distance between two axles is 96 inches or less, the two axles are
tandem axles and the maximum total weight may not exceed 34,000 pounds,
notwithstanding the higher limit resulting from the application of the formula.
      (2)   Vehicles not in a combination having more than four axles may not
exceed the weight in the table in division (F) for four axles measured between
the extreme axles of the vehicle.
      (3)   Vehicles in combination having more than six axles may not exceed
the weight in the table in division (F) for six axles measured between the
extreme axles of the combination.
      (4)   The city, with respect to streets and highways under their
jurisdiction, may also by ordinance or resolution allow the weight limitations
of this division, provided the maximum gross weight on any one axle shall not
exceed 20,000 pounds and the maximum gross weight on any tandem axle shall not
exceed 34,000 pounds, on designated highways when appropriate regulatory signs
giving notice thereof are erected upon the street or highway or portion of any
street or highway affected by that ordinance or resolution.
      (5)   The following are exceptions to the above formula:
         (a)   Two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a total weight of
34,000 pounds each if the overall distance between the first and last axles of
the consecutive sets of tandem axles is 36 feet or more.
         (b)   Vehicles for which a different limit is established and posted
in accordance with ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 15-316.
         (c)   Vehicles for which the Department of Transportation and local
authorities issue overweight permits under authority of ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
15-301. These vehicles are not subject to the bridge formula.
         (d)   Tow trucks subject to the conditions provided in division (D)
may not exceed 24,000 pounds on a single rear axle or 44,000 pounds on a tandem
rear axle.
         (e)   1.   Except as provided in division (F)(5)(i) of this section,
tandem axles on a three-axle truck registered as a Special Hauling Vehicle,
manufactured prior to or in the model year of 2024, and registered in Illinois
prior to January 1, 2025, with a distance greater than 72 inches but not more
than 96 inches between any series of two axles, is allowed a combined weight on
the series not to exceed 36,000 pounds and neither axle of the series may
exceed 20,000 pounds. Any vehicle of this type manufactured after the model
year of 2024 or first registered in Illinois after December 31, 2014 may not
exceed a combined weight of 34,000 pounds through the series of two axles and
neither axle of the series may exceed 20,000 pounds.
            2.   A three-axle combination sewer cleaning jetting vacuum truck
registered as a Special Hauling Vehicle, used exclusively for the
transportation of non-hazardous solid waste, manufactured before or in the

         (g)   Combinations of vehicles, registered as Special Hauling Vehicles
that include a semitrailer manufactured prior to or in the model year of 2024,
and registered in Illinois prior to January 1, 2025, having five axles with a
distance of 42 feet or less between extreme axles, may not exceed the following
maximum weights: 20,000 pounds on a single axle; 34,000 pounds on a tandem
axle; and 72,000 pounds gross weight. This combination of vehicles is not
subject to the bridge formula. For all those combinations of vehicles that
include a semitrailer manufactured after January 1, 2004, the overall distance
between the first and last axles of the two sets of tandems must be 18 feet 6
inches or more. Any combination of vehicles that has had its cargo container
replaced in its entirety after December 31, 2024, may not exceed the weights
allowed by the bridge formula.
         (h)   A four-axle truck mixer registered as a Special Hauling Vehicle,
used exclusively for the mixing and transportation of concrete in the plastic
state, and not operated on a highway that is part of the National System of
Interstate Highways, is allowed the following maximum weights: 20,000 pounds on
any single axle; 36,000 pounds on a series of axles greater than 72 inches but
not more than 96 inches; and 34,000 pounds on any series of two axles greater
than 40 inches but nor more than 72 inches. The gross weight of this vehicle
may not exceed the weights allowed by the bridge formula for four axles. The
bridge formula does not apply to any series of three axles while the vehicle is
transporting concrete in the plastic state, but no axle or tandem axle of the
series may exceed the maximum weight permitted under this division (F).
         (i)   A three-axle rear discharge truck mixer registered as a Special
Hauling Vehicle, used exclusively for the mixing and transportation of concrete
in the plastic state, may, when laden, transmit upon the road surface, except
when on part of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, the
following maximum weights: 22,000 pounds on single axle; 40,000 pounds on a
tandem axle; 54,000 pounds gross weight on a three-axle vehicle. This vehicle
is not subject to the bridge formula.
      (6)   No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with other than
pneumatic tires may be operated, unladen or with load, upon the highways of
this state when the gross weight on the road surface through any wheel exceeds
800 pounds per inch width of tire tread or when the gross weight on the road
surface through any axle exceeds 16,000 pounds.
   (G)   A vehicle and load not exceeding 80,000 pounds is allowed travel on
non- designated highways so long as there is no sign prohibiting that access.
   (H)   No person shall operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over a
bridge or other elevated structure constituting part of a highway with a gross
weight which is greater than the maximum weight permitted by the Department,
when that structure is sign- posted as provided in this section.
   (I)   The Illinois department of transportation, upon request from the city,
shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of any bridge
or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if it finds
that the structure cannot with safety to itself withstand the weight of
vehicles otherwise permissible under this chapter the Department shall
determine and declare the maximum weight of vehicles which those structures can
withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating maximum weight to
be erected and maintained before each end of the structure. No person shall
operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over any such structure with a
gross weight which is greater than the posted maximum weight.
   (J)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of divisions (H)
or (I) above, proof of the determination of the maximum allowable weight by the
Illinois department of transportation and the existence of the signs,
constitutes conclusive evidence of the maximum weight which can be maintained
with safety to the bridge or structure.

Statutory reference:
   Similar provisions, see ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 15-111
§ 74.111 OFFICERS TO WEIGH VEHICLES AND REQUIRE REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOADS.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and load is unlawful shall require the driver to stop and submit to a
weighing of the same, either by means of portable or stationary scales that
have been tested and approved at a frequency prescribed by the Illinois
Department of Agriculture, or for those scales operated by the state, when such
tests are requested by the Department of State Police, whichever is more
frequent. If the scales are not available at the place where the vehicle is
stopped, the police officer shall require that the vehicle be driven to the
nearest available scale that has been tested and approved pursuant to this
section by the Illinois department of agriculture. Notwithstanding any
provisions of the Weights and Measures Act or the United State Department of
Commerce NIST handbook 44, multi or single draft weighing is an acceptable
method of weighing by law enforcement for determining a violation of ILCS Ch. 3
or 15. Law enforcement is exempt from the requirements of commercial weighing
established in NIST handbook 44.
      Within 18 months after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the
91st General Assembly, all municipal and county officers, technicians, and
employees who set up and operate portable scales for wheel load or axle load or
both and issue citations based on the use of portable scales for wheel load or
axle load or both and who have not successfully completed initial classroom and
field training regarding the set up and operation of portable scales, shall
attend and successfully complete initial classroom and field training
administered by the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board.
   (B)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and the load, determines
that the weight is unlawful, the officer shall require the driver to stop the
vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until that portion of the load
is removed as may be necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit
permitted under this chapter, or to the limit permitted under the terms of a
permit issued pursuant to §§
74.125 through
74.143 and shall forthwith arrest the driver or owner. All material so unloaded
shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at the risk of the
owner or operator; however, whenever a three- or four-axle vehicle with a
tandem axle dimension greater than 72 inches, but less than 96 inches and
registered as a special hauling vehicle is transporting asphalt or concrete in
the plastic state that exceeds axle weight or gross weight limits by less than
4,000 pounds, the owner or operator of the vehicle shall accept the arrest
ticket or tickets for the alleged violations under this section and proceed
without shifting or reducing the load being transported or may shift or reduce
the load under the provisions of divisions (D) or (E) of this section, when
applicable. Any fine imposed following an overweight violation by a vehicle
registered as a special hauling vehicle transporting asphalt or concrete in the
plastic state shall be paid as provided in ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 16-105.
   (C)   Whenever any axle load of a vehicle exceeds the weight limits
permitted by §
74.110 (A) or (G) by 2,000 pounds or less, the owner or operator of the vehicle
must shift or remove the excess so as to comply with §
74.110 (A) or (G). No overweight arrest ticket shall be issued to the owner or
operator of the vehicle by any officer if the excess weight is removed as
required by this division.
   (D)   Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle with a registered gross weight
of 73,280 pounds or less exceeds the weight limits of §
74.110 (B) or (G) by 2,000 pounds or less, the owner or operator of the vehicle
must remove the excess. Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle with a
registered gross weight of 73,281 pounds or more exceeds the weight limits of §
74.110(B) or (G) by 1,000 pounds or less or 2,000 pounds or less if weighed on
wheel load weighers, the owner or operator of the vehicle must remove the
excess. In either case, no arrest ticket for any overweight violation of this
chapter shall be issued to the owner or operator of the vehicle by any officer
if the excess weight is removed as required by this division. A person who has
been granted a special permit under §
74.125 shall not be granted a tolerance on wheel load weighers.
   (E)   Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle exceeds the registration weight
limits established under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 3-801 through § 3-834 by 2,001
pounds or more, the driver or owner, in addition to any other violation or
penalty, shall be fined in accordance to the schedule enumerated in §
74.112.
   (F)   Whenever an axle load of a vehicle exceeds axle weight limits allowed
by the provisions of a permit, an arrest ticket shall be issued, but the owner
or operator of the vehicle may shift the load so as to comply with the
provisions of the permit. Where shifting of a load to comply with the permit is
accomplished, the owner or operator of the vehicle may then proceed.
   (G)   Any driver of a vehicle who refuses to stop and submit his vehicle and
load to weighing after being directed to do so by an officer, or removes or
causes the removal of the load or part of it prior to weighing, shall be
punished as provided in §
70.999.

violation and either may be prosecuted for the violation. Any person, firm, or
corporation convicted of any such violation shall be fined for the first or
second conviction an amount equal to not less than $50 nor more than $500, and
for the third and subsequent convictions by the same person, firm, or
corporation within a period of one year after the date of the first offense,
not less than $500 nor more than $1,000.

§ 74.116 PUSHING OF DISABLED VEHICLES.
   It is unlawful under any circumstances for any vehicle to push any other
vehicle on or along any highway outside an urban area in this city, except in
an extreme emergency, and then the vehicle shall not be pushed farther than is
reasonably necessary to remove it from the roadway or from the immediate hazard
that exists.
(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 15-114)
§ 74.117 WEIGHT OF MOTOR VEHICLE AND LOAD GENERALLY; DISTRIBUTION OF LOAD.
   It shall be unlawful to drive on any street any motor vehicle with a weight,
including load, in excess of that permitted by this chapter for driving on
improved highways, or with weight distributed in a manner not conforming to
such laws.
('64 Code, § 21-147)
§ 74.118 TRUCKS WEIGHING IN EXCESS OF 10,000 POUNDS.
   (A)    All trucks and commercial vehicles having a gross weight including
the weight of the vehicle or combination and its load in excess of 10,000
pounds shall be prohibited from operating, standing, or going upon any streets
or highways within the city for which load limits have been posted in the
manner set forth in this section.
   (B)    The city engineer is authorized to designate such streets or highways
within the city over which the operation of vehicles in excess of 10,000 pounds
is prohibited.
   (C)    Each street or highway shall be designated by appropriate signs
placed upon and along the streets and highways which signs shall specify the
maximum weight allowed on the street or highway.
   (D)   Delivery trucks of all weights shall be allowed to make a pick-up or
delivery at any legally zoned Danville business. In making said pick-up or
delivery, every reasonable effort shall be made to travel along streets
designated in the city code as "truck routes". If, in the opinion of the city
engineer, this is not practical, the shortest possible route to and from the
approved truck route shall be used. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirement,
the city engineer shall have the authority to authorize a different route if,
in doing so, fewer residential properties will be negatively affected. If it
appears that residential properties will be negatively affected on a frequent
basis, and no compromise can be reached between the business and residents, the
city engineer will advise the Traffic Commission who shall make the final
decisions on the matters involved according to their normal procedures. In any
case, once the "preferred route" is established, the owner of the subject
business, and the residents if needed, shall be notified in writing by the city
engineer, and a copy provided to the chief of police and patrol officers.
   (E)   In the case of double-fronted lots, or corner lots where public
streets adjoin more than one portion of a subject lot, the city engineer in
identifying the best route for pick-ups and deliveries shall use discretion. In
making this determination, the city engineer shall try to limit the negative
affect on residential properties. If it appears that residential properties
will be negatively affected on a frequent basis, and no compromise can be
reached between the business and residents, the city engineer will advise the
Traffic Commission who shall make the final decisions on the matters involved,
according to their normal procedures. Alley pick-ups and deliveries shall be
discouraged except in the restricted district and/or alleys that are paved with
asphalt or concrete.
   (F)   In cases that involve a business established prior to the date of this
division (May 16, 2000), remedies to these kinds of conflicts shall not result
in significant financial burden on said business, except that fencing,
screening, or landscaping may be required to reduce the negative impact on
nearby residential properties. The City Council may also impose operational
limitations in order to reduce conflicts. For example, deliveries may be
limited to certain hours, or trucks may be prohibited from parking on or near
the business site with the motor running except during normal business hours.

   (B)    During the aforementioned hours that trucks carrying gasoline or
other volatile materials or explosives are permitted to enter the restricted
district, no such truck shall enter or travel upon any street within the
restricted district unless the truck is to make a delivery within the
restricted district and then no such truck shall be allowed to move upon Main
or Vermilion Streets within the restricted district.

PERMITS AND FEES
§ 74.125 PERMITS FOR EXCESS SIZE AND WEIGHT.
   (A)   Upon application and good cause being shown therefor, issue a special
permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination of
vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified
in this chapter or otherwise not in conformity with this chapter, upon any
highway under the jurisdiction of the party granting such permit and for the
maintenance of which the party is responsible. Applications and permits other
than those in written or printed form may only be accepted from and issued to
the company or individual making the movement. Except for an application to
move directly across a highway, it shall be duty of the applicant to establish
in the application that the load to be moved by such vehicle or combination
cannot reasonably be dismantled or diassembled, the reasonableness of which
shall be determined by the Secretary of the Department. More than one object
may be carried under permit as long as the carriage of the additional object or
objects do not cause the size or weight of the vehicle or load to exceed beyond
that required for carriage of the single, nondivisible object itself. For the
purpose of over length movements, more than one object may be carried side by
side as long as the height, width, and weight laws are not exceeded and the
cause for the over length is not due to multiple objects. For the purpose of
over height movements, more than one object may be carried as long as the cause
for the over height is not due to multiple objects and the length, width, and
weight laws are not exceeded. For the purpose of an overwidth movement, more
than one object may be carried as long as the cause for the over width is not
due to multiple objects and length, height, and weight laws are not exceeded.
No state or local agency shall authorize the issuance of excess size or weight
permits for vehicles and loads that are divisible and that can be carried, when
divided, within the existing size or weight maximums specified in this chapter.
Any excess size or weight permit issued in violation of the provisions of this
section shall be void at issue and any movement made thereunder shall not be
authorized under the terms of the void permit. In any prosecution for a
violation of this chapter when the authorization of an excess size or weight
permit is at issue, it is the burden of the defendant to establish that the
permit was valid because the load to be moved could not reasonably be
dismantled or disassembled, or was otherwise nondivisible.
   (B)    The application for any such permit shall:
      (1)    State whether the permit is requested for a single trip or for
limited continuous operation;
      (2)    State if the applicant is an authorized carrier under ILCS Ch.
625, Act 5, § 18c-1101 et seq., if so, his certificate, registration, or permit
number issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission;
      (3)    Specifically describe and identify the vehicle or vehicles and
load to be operated or moved;
      (4)    State the routing requested, including the points of origin and
destination, and may identify and include a request for routing to the nearest
certified scale in accordance with the department's rules and regulations,
provided the applicant has approval to travel to travel on local roads; and
      (5)    State if the vehicles or loads are being transported for hire.
   (C)    No permits for the movement of a vehicle or load for hire shall be
issued to any applicant who is required under ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 18c-1101
et seq. to have a certificate, registration, or permit, and does not have the
certificate, registration, or permit.
   (D)    The clerk, when not inconsistent with traffic safety, is authorized
to issue or withhold a permit at his discretion; or if the permit is issued at
his discretion, to prescribe the route or routes to be traveled; to limit the
number of trips; to establish seasonal or other time limitations within which
the vehicles described may be operated on the highways indicated; or otherwise
to limit or prescribe conditions of operations of the vehicle or vehicles, when
necessary to assure against undue damage to the road foundations, surfaces, or
structures, and may require undertaking or other security as may be deemed
necessary to compensate for any injury to any roadway or road structure. The
Department shall maintain a daily record of each permit issued along with the
fee and the stipulated dimensions, weights, conditions, and restrictions
authorized and this record shall be presumed correct in any case of questions
or dispute. The Department shall install an automatic device for recording
applications received and permits issued by telephone. In making application by
telephone, the Department and applicant waive all objections to the recording
of the conversation.
   (E)   The Department shall,upon application in writing from the Clerk, issue
an annual permit authorizing the Clerk to move oversize highway construction,
transportation, utility, and maintenance equipment over roads under the
jurisdiction of the Department. The permit shall be applicable only to
equipment and vehicles owned by or registered in the name of the Clerk, and no
fee shall be charged for the issuance of such permits.
   (F)    As an exception to division (A) of this section, the city, with
respect to highways under its jurisdiction, in its discretion and upon
application in writing, may issue a special permit for limited continuous
operation, authorizing the applicant to move loads of sweet corn, soybeans,
corn, wheat, milo, and other small grains and ensilage during the harvest
season only on a two-axle single vehicle registered by the secretary of state
with axle loads not to exceed 35% above those provided in §
74.110. Permits may be issued for a period not to exceed 40 days, and moves may
be made of a distance not to exceed 25 miles from a field to a specified
processing plant over any highway except the National System of Interstate and
Defense Highways. All such vehicles shall be operated in the daytime except
when weather or crop conditions require emergency operation at night, but with
respect to night operation, every vehicle with load shall be equipped with
flashing amber lights as specified under §
74.015. Upon a declaration by the Governor that an emergency harvest situation
exists, a special permit issued by the Department under this section shall not
be required for September 1 through December 31 during harvest season
emergencies, provided that the weight does not exceed 20% above the limits
provided in §
74.110. All other restrictions that apply to permits issued under this section
shall apply during the declared time period. With respect to highways under the
jurisdiction of local authorities, the local authorities may, at their
discretion, waive special permit requirements during harvest season
emergencies. This permit exemption shall apply to all vehicles eligible to
obtain permits under this section, including commercial vehicles in use during
the declared time period.
   (G)    The form and content of the permit shall be determined by the
department with respect to highways underits jurisdiction and by the city with
respect to highways under its jurisdiction. Every permit shall be in written
form and carried in the vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers,
and shall be open to inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of
any authority granting the permit, and no person shall violate any of the terms
or conditions of the special permit. Violation of the terms and conditions of
the permit shall not be deemed a revocation of the permit; however, any vehicle
and load found to be off the route prescribed in the permit shall be held to be
operating without a permit. Any off route vehicle and load shall be required to
obtain a new permit or permits, as necessary, to authorize the movement back
onto the original permit routing. No rule or regulation, nor anything herein
shall be construed to authorize any police officer, court, or authorized agent
of any authority granting the permit to remove the permit from the possession
of the permittee unless the permitee is charged with a fraudulent permit
violation as provided in division (I). However, upon arrest for an offense of
violation of the permit, operating without a permit when the vehicle is off
route, or any size or weight offense under this chapter when the permittee
plains to raise the issuance of the permit as a defense, the permittee, or his
agent, must produce the permit at any court hearing concerning the alleged
offense. If the permit designates and includes a routing to a certified scale,
the permittee, while enroute to the designated scale, shall be deemed in
compliance with the weight provisions of the permit providing the axle or gross
weights do not exceed any of the permitted limits by more than the following
amounts.
   Single axle    2000 pounds
   Tandem axle   3000 pounds
   Gross      5000 pounds
   (H)    Violation of any rule, limitation, or condition or provision of any
permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not
render the entire permit null and void, but the violator shall be deemed guilty
of violation of permit and guilty exceeding any size, weight, or load
limitations in excess of those authorized by the permit. The prescribed route
or routes on the permit are not mere rules, limitations, conditions, or
provisions of the permit, but are also the sole extent of the authorization
granted by the permit. If a vehicle and load are found to be off the route or
routes prescribed by any permit authorizing movement, the vehicle and load are
operating without a permit. Any off route movement shall be subject to the size
and weight maximums, under the applicable provisions of this chapter, as
determined by the type or class highway upon which the vehicle and load are
being operated.
   (I)    Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made under a fraudulent
permit, the permit shall be void, and the person, firm, or corporation to whom
the permit was granted, the driver of the vehicle, in addition to the person
who issued the permit and any accessory, shall be guilty of fraud and either
one or all persons may be prosecuted for the violation. Any person, firm, or
corporation committing the violation shall be guilty of a class 4 felony and
the violators shall be prosecuted under state law, and the person, firm, or
corporation guilty of the violation shall not be issued any permits for a
period of one year after the date of conviction. Penalties for violations of
this section shall be in addition to any penalties imposed for violation of
other sections of this chapter.
   (J)   Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made in violation of a
permit issued in accordance with this section, the person to whom the permit
was granted, or the driver of the vehicle, is guilty of the violation and
either, but not both, persons may be prosecuted for the violation as stated in
this division. Any person, firm, or corporation convicted of a violation shall
be guilty of a petty offense, and shall be fined for the first offense, not
less than $50 nor more than $200 and, for the second offense by the same
person, firm, or corporation within a period of one year, not less than $200
nor more than $300 and, for the third offense by the same person, firm, or
corporation within a period of one year after the date of the first offense,
not less than $300 nor more than $500, and the clerk shall not issue permits to
the person, firm, or corporation convicted of a third offense during a period
of one year after the date of conviction for the third offense.
   (K)   Whenever any vehicle is operated on local roads under permits for
excess width or length issued by local authorities, the vehicle may be moved
upon a state highway for a distance not to exceed one-half mile without a
permit for the purpose of crossing the state highway.
   (L)   Penalties for violations of this section shall be in addition to any
penalties imposed for violation of other sections of this chapter.
   (M)   The department with respect to highways under its jurisdiction and
local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction, in their
discretion and upon application in writing, may issue a special permit for
continuous limited operation, authorizing the applicant to operate a tow-truck
that exceeds the weight limits provided for in §
74.110 (D), provided:
      (1)   No rear single axle of the tow- truck exceeds 26,000 pounds;
      (2)   No rear tandem axle of the tow- truck exceeds 50,000 pounds;
      (3)   Neither the disabled vehicle nor the disabled combination of
vehicles exceed the weight restrictions imposed by ILCS Ch. 15, or the weight
limits imposed under a permit issued by the department prior to hookup;
      (4)   The tow-truck prior to hookup does not exceed the weight
restrictions imposed by ILCS Ch. 15;
      (5) During the tow operation the tow-truck does not violate any weight
restriction sign;
      (6)   The tow-truck is equipped with flashing, rotating, or oscillating
amber lights, visible for at least 500 feet in all directions;
      (7)   The tow-truck is specifically designed and licensed as a tow-truck;
      (8)   The tow-truck has a gross- vehicle weight rating of sufficient
capacity to safely handle the load;
      (9)   The tow-truck is equipped with air brakes;
      (10)    The tow-truck is capable of utilizing the lighting and braking
systems of the disabled vehicle or combination of vehicles;
      (11)    The tow distance of the tow does not exceed 50 miles from the
point of disablement to a place of repair or safekeeping;
      (12)    The permit issued to the tow-truck is carried in the tow-truck
and exhibited on demand by a police officer; and
      (13)    The movement shall be valid only on state routes approved by the
department.

resolution, prohibit the operation of vehicles upon any highway, or impose
restrictions as to the weight of vehicles to be operated upon any highway, for
a total period of not to exceed 90 days, measured in either consecutive or
nonconsecutive days at the discretion of the city council, in any one calendar
year, whenever any highway by reason of deterioration, rain, snow, or other
climate conditions will be seriously damaged or destroyed, unless the use of
vehicles thereon is prohibited or the permissible weights thereof reduced.
   (B)   The City Council, after enacting any such ordinance or resolution,
shall erect or cause to be erected and maintained signs designating the
provision of the ordinance or resolution at each end of that portion of any
highway affected thereby, and the ordinance or resolution shall not be

to the Department.
   (C)   (1)   The City Council, with respect to highways under its
jurisdiction, may also, by ordinance or resolution, prohibit the operation of
trucks or other commercial vehicles, or may impose limitations on the weight

said Department, and such restrictions shall be effective when signs giving
notice thereof are erected upon the highway or portion of any highway affected
by such resolution.
   (E)   When any vehicle is operated in violation of this section, the owner
or driver of the vehicle shall be deemed guilty of a violation and either the
owner or the driver of the vehicle may be prosecuted for the violation. Any
person, firm, or corporation convicted of violating this section shall be fined
$50 for any weight exceeding the posted limit up to the axle or gross weight
limit allowed a vehicle as provided for in §
74.110(A) or (B) and $75 per every 500 pounds or fraction thereof for any
weight exceeding that which is provided for in §

   (B)   The department upon request from any local authority shall, or upon
its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of any bridge or other
elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if it finds that the
structure cannot safely withstand the weight of vehicles otherwise permissible
under §§
74.100 through
74.143, the department shall determine and declare the maximum weight of
vehicles which the structure can withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable
signs stating the maximum weight to be erected and maintained before each end
of the structure.
   (C)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this section,
proof of the determination of the maximum allowable weight by the department,
and the existence of the signs constitutes conclusive evidence of the maximum
weight which can be maintained with safety to the bridge or structure.
(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 15-317)
§ 74.143 LIABILITY IF HIGHWAY OR STRUCTURE DAMAGED.
   (A)   Any person driving any vehicle, object, or contrivance upon any
highway or highway structure is liable for all damage which the highway or
structure may sustain as a result of any illegal operation, driving, or moving
of the vehicle, object, or contrivance, or as a result of operating, driving,
or moving any vehicle, object, or contrivance exceeding the maximum dimensions
or weighing in excess of the maximum weight specified in §§
74.100 through
74.143 but authorized by a special permit issued as provided in those sections.
The measure of liability is the cost of repairing a facility partially damaged
or the depreciated replacement cost of a facility damaged beyond repair
together with all other expenses incurred by the authorities in control of the
highway or highway structure in providing a temporary detour, including a
temporary structure, to serve the needs of traffic during the period of repair
or replacement of the damaged highway or highway structure.
   (B)   Whenever the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, object, or
contrivance, but is so operating, driving, or moving the same with the express
or implied permission of the owner, then the owner and driver are jointly and
severally liable to the extent provided in division (A).
   (C)   Recovery may be had in a civil action brought by the authorities in

COMBINATION THEREOF.
   (A)    A person shall not drive or be in actual physical control of any
vehicle within this city while:
      (1)    The alcohol concentration in the person's blood or breath is 0.10
or more based on the definition of blood and breath units in §
75.0025;

drugs to a degree which renders the person incapable of safely driving.
   (B)    The fact that any person charged with violating this section is or
has been legally entitled to use alcohol, or other drugs, or any combination of
both, shall not constitute a defense against any charge of violating this
section.
(Ord. 6888, passed 1-5-82)
§ 75.002 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE; IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (A)    Any person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor
vehicle upon the public highways of this city shall be deemed to have given
consent, subject to the provisions of §
75.0025 to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, other drug, or combination thereof content of the
person's blood if arrested, as evidenced by the issuance of a uniform traffic
ticket, for any offense as defined in §
75.001. The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of the
arresting officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall
designate which of the aforesaid tests shall be administered by their
enforcement personnel.
   (B)    Any person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a
condition rendering him incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have
withdrawn the consent provided by division (A) above and the test or tests may
be administered, subject to the provisions of §
75.0025.
   (C)    A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be
warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to
submit to the test will result in suspension of the person's license to operate
a motor vehicle for 6 months for the first such arrest and refusal and a
suspension of the privilege for 12 months for the second and each subsequent
arrest and refusal within 5 years. Following this warning, if a person under
arrest refuses upon the request of a law enforcement officer to submit to a
test designated by the law enforcement agency as provided in division (A)
above, none shall be given, but the law enforcement officer shall file with the
clerk of the circuit court for the county in which the arrest was made, a sworn
statement naming the person refusing to take and complete the test or tests
requested under the provisions of this section. The sworn statement shall
identify the arrested person, the person's driver's license number and current
residence address and shall specify that a refusal by the person to take the
test or tests was made. The sworn statement shall include a statement that the
arresting officer had reasonable cause to believe the person was driving the
motor vehicle within this city while under the influence of alcohol, other
drug, or combination thereof, and that the test was made as an incident to and
following the lawful arrest for an offense as defined in §
75.001. The statement shall also specify that the person, after being arrested
for an offense arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while so
driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle, refused to submit to
and complete a test or tests as requested by the law enforcement officer.
   (D)    The clerk shall thereupon notify the person in writing that the
person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle will be suspended unless, within
28 days from the date of mailing of the notice, the person shall request in
writing a hearing thereon; if the person desires a hearing, the person shall
file a complaint in the circuit court for and in the county in which the person
was arrested for the hearing. The hearing shall proceed in the court in the
same manner as other civil proceedings, shall cover only the issues of whether
the person was placed under arrest for an offense as defined in §
75.001 was evidenced by the issuance of a uniform traffic ticket; whether the
arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the person was driving
or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol, other drug, or combination thereof; and whether the person refused to
submit and complete the test or tests upon the request of the law enforcement
officer. Whether the person as informed that the person's privilege to drive
would be suspended if the person refused to submit to the test or tests shall
not be an issue.
   (E)    Immediately upon the termination of the court proceedings, the clerk
shall notify the secretary of state of the court's decision. The secretary of
state shall thereupon suspend the driver's license, the privilege of driving a
motor vehicle on highways of this city given to a nonresident, or the privilege
which an unlicensed person might have to obtain a license under the Driver's
License Act, of the arrested person if that is the decision of the court. If
the court recommends that the person be given a restricted driving permit to
prevent undue hardship, the clerk shall report that fact to the secretary of
state.
(Ord. 6888, passed 1-5-82)
§ 75.0025 CHEMICAL AND OTHER TESTS.
   (A)    Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising
out of an arrest for an offense as defined in §
75.001, evidence of the concentration of alcohol, other drug, or combination
thereof in a person's blood or breath at the time alleged, as determined by
analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance, shall
be admissible. Where such a test is made the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)    Chemical analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath, or other
bodily substance to be considered valid under the provisions of this section
shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the State
Department of Public Health in consultation with the State Department of Law
Enforcement by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by that
Department for this purpose.
      (2)    When a person shall submit to a blood test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under the provisions of §
75.002, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a registered nurse,
or other qualified person approved by the State Department of Public Health may
withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and
drug content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath
or urine specimens.
      (3)    The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified person of
their own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any
administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a
law enforcement officer.
      (4)    Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a chemical test
or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information
concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or the
person's attorney.
      (5)    Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per 100
milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.
   (B)    Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising
out of the acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or
in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
the concentration of alcohol in the person's blood or breath at the time
alleged as shown by analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath, or other
bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:
      (1)    If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or
less, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of
alcohol.
      (2)    If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of
0.05 but less than 0.10, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that
the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be
considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was
under the influence of alcohol.
      (3)    If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or
more, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
      (4)    The foregoing provisions of this section shall not be construed as
limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the
question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.
   (C)    If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test under
the provisions of §
75.002, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action
or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the
person under the influence of alcohol, or other drugs, or combination of both
was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.
(Ord. 6888, passed 1-5-82)

the first division with the passenger compartment enclosed by a partition or
dividing window used in the for-hire transportation of passengers and operated
by an individual in possession of a valid Illinois driver's license of the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 90.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following shall have the following
meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   “AT LARGE.” The conduct of an animal outside of an enclosure and not on a
leash, runline, or otherwise restrained and under the direct and immediate
control of a person physically capable of restraining the animal.
   "BITE." To seize with the teeth or jaws so that the person or animal seized
has been nipped, gripped, wounded, or pierced, and includes without limitation
any contact of saliva with any break or abrasion of the skin.
   "COMPANION ANIMAL." An animal commonly considered to be, or to be used as, a
pet. "COMPANION ANIMAL" includes, but is not limited to, canines, felines, and
equines.
   "DANGEROUS DOG." Any dog that, because of its aggressive nature, training or
characteristic behavior, presents a risk of serious physical harm or death to
human beings, or would constitute a danger to human life, physical well-being,
or property if not kept under restraint and under direct control. The term
“dangerous dog” includes any dog that, when unprovoked, has chased or
approached a person on any public or private property in a menacing fashion or
apparent attitude of attack. The term “dangerous dog” shall not apply to dogs
utilized by Law Enforcement Officers in the performance of their duties.
   “DIRECT CONTROL.” The term “direct control” means immediate, continuous
physical control of a dog such as by means of a leash, cord, secure fence, or
chain of such strength to restrain the dog and controlled by a person capable
of restraining the dog, or safe and secure restraint within a vehicle. If the

   (A)   The chief may grant variances from any of the provisions of this
chapter or the IFC, upon written application for variance by the owner or
lessee, or the duly authorized agent of the owner or lessee, whenever the chief
finds that there are practical difficulties in carrying out the strict letter
of this chapter or the IFC; provided, however, that the spirit of this chapter
or the IFC shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice
done in any variance so granted. If an application for variance is denied by
the chief, the applicant shall be notified of such denial in writing with the
reasons for such denial. The chief may set reasonable conditions upon any
variance granted hereunder.
   (B)   Any applicant for a variance whose application has been denied shall
have the right to appeal such denial to the mayor within ten days after the
denial is issued by the bureau. Upon hearing with reasonable notice to the
applicant and to the chief, the mayor may either affirm the denial or return
the application to the bureau for further consideration. An application so
returned shall be reconsidered by the chief, and a variance may be granted with
such reasonable conditions as the chief may establish, or the chief may refuse
to grant a variance after such reconsideration.
   (C)   If the mayor affirms the denial of the application, or if the
application has been returned to chief but has been denied by the chief upon
reconsideration, the applicant shall have the right to appeal such denial to
the Circuit Court of Vermilion County within 15 days after the final action
appealed from. The sole issue on appeal is whether or not the denial of the
application was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence presented to
the chief at the time of the application in light of the purposes and intent of
this chapter or the IFC and applicable laws of the city and state pertaining to
fire prevention and life safety protection.

   (A)   The affirmative action program shall be administered by the Division.
   (B)   The Division shall:
      (1)   Determine whether a commitment complies with the terms of §
95.15;
      (2)   Determine whether the performance under such commitment complies
with §
95.15;
      (3)   Monitor the performance of persons and firms covered by §
95.15 to determine whether such persons and firms are continuing compliance
with the terms of their commitment;
      (4)   Notify the Mayor and appropriate Department Head whenever a person
or firm is determined not to be in compliance with an affirmative action
program contained in such person’s or firm’s written commitment.
   (C)   Upon a determination by the Division of noncompliance, the Director
shall inform the noncomplying person or firm of the nature and extent of the
noncompliance. If the noncompliance persists, the Director, appropriate
Department Head and the noncomplying person or firm shall together examine the
charges of noncompliance and attempt to resolve the situation to establish full
compliance with the provisions of §
95.15 and the terms of any affirmative action program executed in a written

sustain in the event of a breach of contract, and the amount is agreed to be
the amount of damages which the city would sustain; or
      (4)   Impose such other sanctions as may be recommended by the Commission

restoration agreement a provision requiring that the tenant pay a reasonable
amount of money not to exceed the cost of the restorations. The landlord shall
keep such money in a separate account and the interest earned on any such
account shall accrue to the benefit of the tenant. A landlord may condition

reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installations of grab bars;
and, usable kitchens and bathrooms such that an individual in a wheelchair can
maneuver about the space.
      (4)   The city may review and adopt procedures for the approval of newly

in nor is there owned or reserved on his or her behalf, under any express or
voluntary agreement, title to or any right to all or a portion of the proceeds
from the sale or rental of more than three single-family dwelling units at any
one time;
         (b)   The owner was the last current resident, or in the case of the
sale of any such single-family dwelling unit by a private individual owner not
residing in such house at the time of sale or who was not the most recent
resident of such dwelling unit prior to sale, the exemption granted by this
division shall apply only with respect to one such sale within any 24 month
period;

giving preference to such persons, unless such membership in such religion is
restricted on account of race, color, or national origin. Nor shall anything in
this section prohibit a private club not in fact open to the public, which,
incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides lodgings which it owns or

privately owned residential property shall be required to obtain a Class TEMP-
N license if that person intends to sell alcohol for on-premises consumption.
      (3)   In the case where alcohol will be sold, served or consumed at a

shall have a TEMP-N license unless that person possesses a Class TEMP-
C license.
      (6)   No more than three Class TEMP-N licenses shall be issued to an
applicant in a 365 consecutive day period. It shall be unlawful for any person

other person can avoid the maximum number of Class TEMP-N licenses allowable
within the aforesaid time period. This limitation in the number of Class TEMP-
N licenses shall not apply to the City of Danville.

rider shall constitute an executory contract with the city for bankruptcy
purposes.
   (E)   Termination of operations. A license and/or rider shall automatically
become void in the event the licensee terminates that operation of the
licensee’s business. However, the licensee may continue to operate under such

aforesaid information, the applicant shall be removed from the top spot on the
waiting list and the applicant next on the list shall be afforded the
opportunity to qualify for the available license or rider.
      (4)   In the event that a licensee seeks to sell, transfer, or otherwise
convey their establishment, the buyer seeking to acquire the establishment

including a certification of insurance, all as provided in § 96.03, and has met
the qualifications to receive a license, the buyer will be placed on the top of

following shall apply.

            2.   For each offense of §
96.29(A) (sale or gift to or purchase for a minor), §

be ordered to pay all costs and fees incurred by the city in prosecuting the

      (9)   It shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of possession of
alcohol upon a public right-of-way, other than a street for vehicular travel,
that the said public right of way is immediately adjacent to and the parcel of

registration card shall be presumed to be the principal residence of the person
to whom such document was issued.
   (C)   Changing classes of license. The liquor commissioner shall have the
authority to change the class of license if the liquor commissioner or the
deputy liquor commissioner determines that the basis or reason for issuing a
particular license has changed and that another class of license is more
appropriate given the nature of the licensee’s then current business
operations. In the case of a change of license, the licensee shall pay the
increased difference between the licensee’s current license and the new
license. Under no circumstance shall the city refund the difference in fees if
the new license has a higher fee than the license it is replacing.

suspended, consistent with the Illinois Liquor Control Commission’s action. If
the Illinois Gaming Board cancels, revokes or suspends any licensee’s authority
to display, operate and allow the public to play one or more VGTs on the
licensee’s premises, but where the Illinois Liquor Control Commission has taken
no adverse action against the licensee’s state authority to sell or serve
alcohol for on-premises consumption, the licensee shall be permitted to
continue selling or serving alcohol for on-premises consumption consistent with
that licensee’s class of city-issued license. Notwithstanding the immediate
foregoing, if the Illinois Gaming Board cancels, revokes or suspends a Class
VGH licensee’s authority to display, operate and allowance of the public to
play the licensee’s one or more VGTs, the action of the Illinois Gaming Board
also shall be deemed to automatically cancel, revoke or suspend the Class VGH
licensee’s authority to sell or serve alcohol on the said licensee’s premises.
If the holder of a cancelled, revoked or suspended Class VGH license wishes to
sell or serve alcohol for on-premises consumption, the holder of the Class VGH
license must apply for a Class A license pending availability of any such
license.

commissioner shall schedule a hearing on the denial within 21 days of the

§ 99.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for construction and maintenance in, on, over, and above rights-of-
way within the City's jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit
consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual
qualities of the City rights-of-way and the City as a whole. Nothing herein
shall be construed to limit the ability of the City to regulate its rights-of-
way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this Chapter, the City intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the City and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities and other entities desiring to use the
right-of-way, by establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by
their facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
City's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of the user's facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space that characterizes the City's residential
neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of- way;
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to any facilities locations; and
      (10)   Prevent the proliferation of facilities utilizing the rights-of-
way or the area adjacent to the rights-of-way which would increase the expense
of maintenance and the cost of repair, rebuilding, and expansion of the rights-
of-way.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this Chapter. This Chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the City. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this Chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The City, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the City
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the City enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the City may take into consideration special needs of the entity and
provide for terms and conditions which vary from the terms and conditions of
this Chapter but are still consistent with the intent of this Chapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. In the event of
any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this Chapter and
the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the City
and any user, the provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement
shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful
renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. In the event this Chapter conflicts
with all or parts of other chapters, the more restrictive of the two will
supersede.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
Chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The City shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this Chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this Chapter when the City so
determines the necessity therefore. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit
the ability of the City to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the
public health, safety and welfare.
   (I)   City Engineer. All construction, maintenance and repair of all rights-
of-way owned and controlled by the City, including but not limited to streets,
alleys, parking lots, sidewalks, parkways, and easements, shall be under the
supervision of the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall be charged with the
enforcement of all ordinance provisions relating to the construction,
maintenance and repair of such public ways and is hereby authorized to enforce
such ordinances.

§ 99.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   City Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the City Engineer
25 days after filing for work involving excavations and 10 days after filing
for work not involving excavation or new construction. If the application does
not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the City Engineer shall reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the City Engineer is satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Chapter and applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the City Engineer shall issue
a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the
duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer,
that the construction proposed under the application shall be in full
compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
   (B)   Expedited Review Option. At the request of the applicant when
accompanied by an expedited review fee, the permit application will be reviewed
by the City Engineer subject to the requirements of division (A) within 5
working days. The expedited review fee shall be $1.50 per foot of installation
with a minimum fee of $225 and a maximum fee of $750.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the City authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on City rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this Chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting. If notified by the City that attendance at a
pre- construction meeting is required, no construction shall begin pursuant to
a permit issued under this Chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all
major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit
at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a
date, time and place designated by the City with such City representatives in
attendance as the City deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of
reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-
way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
City does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the City and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS; AS-BUILT MAPS.
   (A)   Revised permit drawings. In the event that the actual locations of any
facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the
plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the
permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the City prior to
the start of any permit related work in the format required by the City. The
revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of
the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. Any
deviations from the permit must be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer
prior to implementation of the permit work. If any deviation from the permit
also deviates from the requirements of this Chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
99.21 of this Chapter. If the City denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefore.
   (B)   As-built plan drawings. As-built plan drawings drawn to scale for the
installation shall be submitted and approved by the City Engineer within 30
days of completion of construction activities. The as-built drawings at a
minimum shall include those items required in §
99.04 including:
      (1)   Edges of pavement, sidewalk, right- of-way lines, street names, and
known utilities.
      (2)   Installed location of facility relative to the public right-of-way
shown as a dimension from the right-of-way.
      (3)   Installed depth of facility.
      (4)   Both paper and electronic as-built drawings shall be submitted to
the City Engineer. Electronic as-built drawings shall be submitted to the City
Engineer in a CAD format that is suitable to the City CAD and GIS system.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the City, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents,
and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in divisions (1)
and (2):
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as “X,” “C,” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for
each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (5)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this Section to the City within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefore from the City.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.    
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled
nor the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the
City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the Mayor of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in no
event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the City evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A). A utility
that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to
comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under
division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D) of this
section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the City
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer” under
the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the City and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the City and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this Chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
Chapter by the City, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this Section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this Chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to this Chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permitee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the City may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this Chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this Chapter to perform that the City must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the City from the permitee pursuant to
this Chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the City in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the City, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
City. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
City and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the City of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the City and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be $20,000 for
each permit or as otherwise determined by the City Engineer. The amount shall
be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, and may also include reasonable, directly
related costs that the City estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The City, upon 14 days advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the City for such amount within the 14-day notice
period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the City for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the City has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Chapter that the City
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
City that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee
shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division (C).
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the City,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the City, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Two years after completion of the
work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return
of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the City for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
Chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the City as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the City with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether
reserved by this Chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the City may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

§ 99.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division.
      (1)   No interference with City facilities. No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the City Engineer determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the City's
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the City's utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No Limitations on Visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb to the street face of the pole, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway to the street face of the pole and are not

appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of City highways may
require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or
additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities shall not be
located in culverts, or drainage facilities.

require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are not
highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The City may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The City may require any freestanding facility located within a
right- of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground at
that location;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of

practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not physically practicable. Other means shall
include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles,
cable supports and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from
the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are
volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under
significant pressure or potential, present high degrees of risk and such
installations are not permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The City may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular
locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if, in
the opinion of the City Engineer, it does not impair the aesthetic quality of
the lands being traversed.

         (a)   Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be
accomplished from pits as located in the approved plans. Pits for boring or
jacking shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of boring or
jacking operations and backfilled within 48 hours after boring or jacking
operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and
protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced,
and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads
that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
         (b)   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         (c)   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over six

one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the City Engineer.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by the approved erosion
control plan and State and Federal laws. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with the IDOT's “Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction” and
Chapter 100.
         (b)   For a period of 2 years from the date construction of a facility
is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore any
backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Engineer, the utility, at its expense, shall remove any pavement
and backfill material to the top of the installed facility, place new backfill
material, and restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the
proper grades, as determined by the Engineer within 45 days of being notified
to do so. If at the end of 45 days the work has not been completed, the City
may perform the work and be reimbursed according to §
99.10.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic and the requirements of § 99.10 and Chapter 100 are met. If a
variance to the limitation set forth in this division (4) is permitted under §
99.21, the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Permit Required. A permit for pavement cuts shall be obtained
according to § 99.10 or § 100.40 as applicable.
   (B)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled according to
Chapter 100 or as designated by the Engineer.
   (C)   Restoration of pavement shall be accomplished as soon as practicable,
according to Chapter 100. Pavement restorations shall be required to remain in
at least as good condition as the surrounding pavement until such time that the
entire pavement is replaced or rehabilitated. If so ordered by the Engineer,
the utility, at its expense, shall remove and replace pavement restorations
within 45 days of being notified to do so by the Engineer. If at the end of 45
days the work has not been completed, the City may perform the work and be

asphalt material. Temporary patches shall be made within 24 hours of
backfilling unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. The material shall
be compacted in place and maintained until a permanent restoration is
installed. Temporary repairs shall be maintained by the utility and repaired
within 24 hours notification by the City after which time the City may elect to
maintain the repair and seek reimbursement according to § 99.10. Permanent
restorations shall take place within 30 calendar days unless otherwise approved
by the City Engineer.
   (E)   Use of steel plates. Steel plates covering an excavation within a
highway shall be installed only with the permission of the City Engineer. Steel
plates shall be secured with bituminous asphalt ramps a minimum of 6 inches in
width. Steel plates shall be removed within 7 calendar days and the pavement
opening temporarily or permanently restored unless otherwise approved by the
City Engineer. The City of Danville Department of Public Works shall be
notified upon the installation of steel plates and shall be notified of their
removal.
   (F)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.iv) For all rights-of-way which have
been reconstructed with a concrete surface/base in the last 7 years, or
resurfaced in the last 3 years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is
determined to be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary and
unforeseen before the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is
necessary for a J.U.L.I.E. locate.
   (G)   Opening to traffic. Highways shall not be reopened to traffic until
the density and or strength requirements of Chapter 100 are met.
   (H)   Encasement shall be required for facilities under a highway.
      (1)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the highway
and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either by one-
piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the City.
      (2)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one foot
(0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground
vent pipes shall be located in the area established as clear zone for that
particular section of the highway.
      (3)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall be
furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or City approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway.
      (4)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may be
eliminated.
      (5)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
         (a)   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair and
         (b)   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
      (6)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
   (I)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided and

the standards established by other official regulatory agencies for the
appropriate industry, the requirements of
Chapter 100 and §
99.13.
      (2)   Material storage on right-of-way. No material shall be stored on
the right-of-way without the prior written approval of the City Engineer. When
such storage is permitted, all materials shall be distributed along the right-
of-way prior to and during installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the
public or an obstacle to right-of-way maintenance or damage to the right-of-way
and other property.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.17 VEGETATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Electric Utilities - compliance with state laws and regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the City as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities - tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this Chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The City will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The City may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The City may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.
   (D)   Chemical use.
      (1)   Except as provided in the following paragraph, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the City for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or
disease.
      (2)   Spraying of any type of brush- killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Engineer that such spraying is the only practicable method of vegetation
control.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.18 REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the City, a
utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
City improvement in or upon, or the operations of the City in or upon, the
rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the City, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this Chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The City retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the City, as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or
useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior
to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities.
      (1)   Upon abandonment of a facility within the rights-of-way of the
City, the utility shall notify the City within 90 days. Following receipt of
such notice the City may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the
facility if the City Engineer determines that such removal will be in the best
interest of the public health, safety and welfare.
      (2)   In the event that the use of a facility within the rights-of-way of
the City is discontinued for a continuous period of 90 days, the utility shall
be deemed to have abandoned that facility. Any part of the system that is
parallel or redundant to other parts of the system and is intended for use only
when needed as backup for the system, or part thereof, shall not be deemed to
have been abandoned because of its lack of use.
      (3)   The City Engineer may give the utility permission to abandon,
without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed,
operated or maintained by it. Unless such permission is granted, the utility
shall remove all abandoned above-ground facilities and equipment within 180
days of receipt of written notice from the City Engineer and shall restore any
affected right-of-way to its former state at the time the facilities and
equipment were installed so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its
facilities and equipment, the utility shall refill, at its own expense, any
excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave the right-of-ways in as
good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially
interfering with any other utility's facilities. The City Engineer shall have
the right to inspect and approve the removal.
      (4)   A utility may abandon any underground facility in place so long as
it does not materially interfere with the use of the right-of-way in which such
facility is located or with the use thereof by any other utility. If the City
Engineer determines that some or all of such abandoned facilities would
materially interfere with the use of the right-of-way, he may require the
utility to remove the facilities within a reasonable period of time.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.19 CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION.
   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the rights-of-
way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by
the utility, all to the satisfaction of the City. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the City Engineer. Such cleanup and repair
may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or
any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The
time period provided in this Section may be extended by the City Engineer for
good cause shown.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.20 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the City and at the utility's expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of- way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
City Engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
City police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
      (4)   A permit shall be obtained according to §
99.10 or §
100.40 as applicable.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the City a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after
an emergency repair.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this Chapter must do so in writing to the City Engineer as
a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of
this Chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance
should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The City Engineer shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this Chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The City Engineer may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the City Engineer may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this Chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this Chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the City
Engineer under the provisions of this Chapter shall have the right to appeal to
the Mayor. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City
Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The Mayor shall commence his or her consideration of the appeal
within 30 days after the filing of the appeal. The Mayor shall timely decide
the appeal.
(Ord. 8713, passed 11-2-10; Am. Ord. 8940, passed 4-15-14)
§ 99.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the City will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this Chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the City's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the City. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

impounded motor vehicle. If a bond has been posted, the Hearing Officer shall
enter an order deducting any penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter from the
bond so posted.
   (D)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an impounded motor
vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record, or other person who is

telecommunications through a sale at retail.
   (H)   "RETAILER." Includes every person engaged in the business of making

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the Department, furnishes adequate security to
insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the Department at its discretion.
   (I)   "RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE", or any like

in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   (L)   "TAXPAYER." A person who individually or through his or her agents,
employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or
receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability
as authorized by the Article.

a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "TELECOMMUNICATIONS" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-
company facilities, and all tele-communications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in Section
2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.

§ 113.02 SIMPLIFIED MUNICIPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS TAX IMPOSED.
Commencing January 1, 2003, a tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the
following acts or privileges:
   (A)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail
from a retailer.
   (B)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail
from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or privilege
that is subject to taxation under this subdivision, any taxpayer, upon proof
that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be
allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such
other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state.

taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.
(Ord. 8267, passed 9-3-02)
§ 113.04 RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT.
   Commencing on February 1, 2003, the tax imposed under this chapter on

information as required by the Department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, Section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to implement this
Act.
(Ord. 8267, passed 9-3-02)
§ 113.05 RESELLERS.
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this Article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.
(Ord. 8267, passed 9-3-02)
§ 113.06 PROCEEDS DEPOSITED; DISBURSEMENTS.
   (A)   The proceeds of the tax imposed by this chapter shall be deposited in
the Capital Improvement Fund of the city.
   (B)   Disbursements of the proceeds shall be for municipal purposes for
capital goods, projects and improvements.
(Ord. 9067, passed 9-20-16)
§ 113.07 SEVERABILITY.

this chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence
shall not affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that
can be given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its
application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter.

the Local Tax Administrator shall not be inconsistent with this section and the
Act.
      “LOCALLY IMPOSED AND ADMINISTERED TAX" OR "TAX." Each tax imposed by the

without written protest at the time of payment in the event that a locally
imposed and administered tax is declared invalidly enacted or unconstitutional
by a court of competent jurisdiction. However, a taxpayer shall not be deemed
to have paid the tax voluntarily if the taxpayer lacked knowledge of the facts
upon which to protest the taxes at the time of payment, or if the taxpayer paid
the taxes under duress.
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided in relation to a particular tax, the
statute of limitations on a claim for credit or refund shall be four years
after the end of the calendar year in which payment in error was made. The city

      (3)   The procedure for claiming a credit or refund of locally imposed
and administered taxes, interest or penalties paid in error shall be as
follows:
         (a)   The taxpayer shall submit to the Local Tax Administrator in
writing a claim for credit or refund together with a statement specifying:
            1.   The name of the locally imposed and administered tax subject
to the claim,
             2.   The tax period for the locally imposed and administered tax
subject to the
claim;
            3.   The date of the tax payment subject to the claim and the
canceled check or receipt for the payment;
            4.   The taxpayer's recalculation, accompanied by an amended or
revised tax return, in connection with the claim; and
            5.   A request for either a refund or a credit in connection with
the claim to be applied to the amount of tax, interest and penalties overpaid,
and, as applicable, related interest on the amount overpaid; provided, however,
that there shall be no refund and only a credit given in the event the taxpayer
owes any monies to the city.
         (b)   Within 30 days of the receipt by the Local Tax Administrator of
any claim for a refund or credit, the Local Tax Administrator shall either:
            1.   Grant the claim, or
            2.   Deny the claim, in whole or in part, together with a statement
as to the reason for the denial or the partial grant and denial.
         (c)   In the event the Local Tax Administrator grants, in whole or in
part, a claim for refund or credit, the amount of the grant for refund or
credit shall bear interest at the rate of 4% per annum, based on a year of 365
days and the number of days elapsed from the date of the overpayment to the
date of mailing of a refund check or the grant of a credit.
   (H)   Audit procedure. Any request for proposed audit pursuant to any
locally administered tax shall comply with the notice requirements of this

         (c)   A brief description of the books and records to be made
available for the auditor.
      (2)   Any audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, and if
the date and time selected by the Local Tax Administrator is not agreeable to
the taxpayer, another date and time may be requested by the taxpayer within 30
days after the originally designated audit and during normal business hours.
      (3)   The taxpayer may request an extension of time to have an audit
conducted. The audit shall be conducted not less than seven days nor more than
30 days from the date the notice is given, unless the taxpayer and the Local
Tax Administrator agreed to some other convenient time. In the event the
taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the
taxpayer may request another date within the 30 days, approved in writing, that
is convenient to the taxpayer and the Local Tax Administrator.
      (4)   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the
taxpayer's business or activities, including original source documents and
books of entry denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given
rise to any tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in
the English language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by
the city.
      (5)   It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make
available its books and records for inspection by the city. If the taxpayer
fails to provide the documents necessary for audit within the time provided,
the Local Tax Administrator may issue a tax determination and assessment based
on the Tax Administrator's determination of the best estimate of the taxpayer's
tax liability.
      (6)   If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a locally
imposed and administered tax as a result of the audit, written notice of the
amount of overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer within 30 days of the

         (b)   The amount of the tax liability proposed;
         (c)   The procedure for appealing the assessment; and
         (d)   The obligations of the city during the audit, appeal, refund and
collection process.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives written notice from the Local Tax
Administrator of a determination of tax due or assessment may file with the
Local Tax Administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting
forth the basis of the taxpayer's request for a hearing. The written protest
and petition for hearing must be filed with the Local Tax Administrator within
45 days of receipt of the written notice of the tax determination and
assessment.
      (3)   If a timely written notice and petition for hearing is filed, the
Local Tax Administrator shall fix the time and place for hearing and shall give
written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date
within 14 days of receipt of the written protest and petition for hearing,
unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.
      (4)   If a written protest and petition for hearing is not filed within
the 45-day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall become a
final bill due and owing without further notice.
      (5)   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer, and the full
payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the Local Tax Administrator may reopen or extend the time
for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than 90 days after the expiration of the 45-day period.
   (J)   Hearing.
      (1)   Whenever a taxpayer has filed a timely written protest and petition
for hearing under division (I) of this section, the Local Tax Administrator
shall conduct a hearing regarding any appeal.
      (2)   No continuances shall be granted, except in cases where a
continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack
of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted
shall not exceed 14 days.
      (3)   At the hearing the Local Tax Administrator shall preside and shall
hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit
or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings
shall not apply.
      (4)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Local Tax Administrator shall
make a written determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the
hearing. The taxpayer shall be provided with a copy of the written decision.
   (K)   Interest and penalties. In the event that a tax is due and owing to
the city, the tax must be paid within the time frame set forth in the ordinance
imposing the tax. If the city determines that a tax has not been paid when due,
then interest and penalties shall apply as hereinafter provided.
      (1)   Interest. The rate of interest on all late payments, underpayments,
or nonpayments of a tax shall be 2% per month, or part thereof, commencing the
day following the due date of such tax to and including the day of payment.
      (2)   Late filing and payment penalties. If a tax return is not filed
within the time and manner proved by the controlling tax ordinance, a late
filing penalty of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a
return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall
be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance, and prior to the city issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure-to-file penalty shall be
assessed, equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure-to-file penalty is imposed.
   (L)   Abatement. The Local Tax Administrator shall have the authority to
waive or abate any late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file
penalty if the Local Tax Administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists
for delay or failure to make a filing.
   (M)   Installment contracts. The city may enter into an installment contract
with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance.
The Local Tax Administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered
unless the taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice
by the Local Tax Administrator that the payment is at least ten days
delinquent, the taxpayer shall have 14 days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the 14-day period, or fails to
demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the Local
Tax Administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without further
notice to the taxpayer.
   (N)   Statute of limitations. The city, through the Local Tax Administrator,
shall review all tax returns in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers
of any amounts due and owing. The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving
notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide
any tax still due and owing.
      (1)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed, or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
      (2)   If any tax return is not filed, or if, during any four-year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
city, the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations
shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which return
for the applicable period was due, or end of the calendar year in which the
return for the applicable period was filed.
      (3)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return
was filed by the taxpayer.
   (O)   Voluntary disclosure. For any locally imposed and administered tax for
which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation,
or assessment from the Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file
an application with the Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of
the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to
pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods
prior to the filing of the application, but not more than four years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax, along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the
filing of the voluntary disclosure application, or the date agreed to by the
Local Tax Administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the Local Tax
Administrator, whichever is longer.
   (P)   Publication of tax ordinances. Any locally administered tax ordinance
shall be published via normal or standard publishing requirements. The posting
of a tax ordinance on the Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements.
Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request
at the City Clerk's office.
   (Q)   Liens. The Local Tax Administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.
Upon a determination by the Local Tax Administrator that the lien is valid, the
lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the Local Tax Administrator shall:
      (1)   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
      (2)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
      (3)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
   (R)   Application. This section shall be liberally construed and
administered to supplement all of the city's tax ordinances. To the extent that
any tax ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this section, this
section shall be controlling.

§ 116.13 PROCEEDS OF TAX AND FINES.
   All proceeds resulting from the imposition of the taxes under §§
116.10 and
116.11 including penalties, shall be paid into the treasury of the City and

2.50% is deposited into the corporate fund of the City and the additional .25%
is to be distributed to the Community Reinvestment Fund 310.

HOTEL AND MOTEL ROOM TAX
§ 116.30 FINDING AND DECLARATION OF COUNCIL.
   It is found and declared that the Danville Metropolitan Exposition
Auditorium and Office Building Authority has been established for the
entertainment, cultural and educational benefit of the citizens of the city and
the city should cooperate and assist the Authority in providing these benefits
to the city. There exists the likelihood that from time to time the David S.
Palmer Arena will not be self-sustaining and may be in need of additional funds
to insure capable and efficient operation of its facilities for the benefit of
the people of the city.
   It is also found and declared that the Danville Area Convention and Visitors
Bureau, and the City’s parks including Harrison Park Golf Course provide a
service, which improves the quality of life in the city, and the city should
also cooperate and assist them with additional funds to insure efficient
operation of these parks and facilities, for the benefit of the people of the
city.
   For this reason, a tax upon the use and privilege of renting a hotel or
motel room shall be levied and proceeds from such tax used for the benefit of
the David S. Palmer Arena, Danville Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, and
the City’s Parks Division including Harrison Park Golf Course.

GENERAL REGULATIONS
§ 120.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "BED AND BREAKFAST ESTABLISHMENT." An operator-occupied residence at a
specific location providing lodging accommodations for a charge to the public
conforming with the following minimum standards:
      (1)   Shall provide five or less rooms for rent.
      (2)   Shall be in operation (available to the public) more than ten
nights in a 12-month period.
      (3)   The only formal meal served to paying guests shall be breakfast.
      (4)   Shall allow no more than two guests per sleeping room, per night.
      (5)   The term "BED AND BREAKFAST" facility shall not be construed to
mean "motel", "hotel", "boarding house", "food service establishment",
"conference center", "retreat facility", or "reception hall".
      (6)   A room within a bed and breakfast establishment shall be considered
a hotel room or motel room for purposes of §§
116.35 through
116.43 inclusive of this code of ordinances, pertaining to hotel or motel room
tax.
   "OPERATOR." The owner of the bed and breakfast or vacation rental
establishment or the owner's manager, who is required to reside in the
establishment if the establishment is a bed and breakfast. If more than one
structure is involved at a given location, the city shall rule on which
structure shall be considered appropriate; however, the intent is to have the
owner/manager reside within the structure with the most guest rooms if the
structure is a bed and breakfast.
   “VACATION RENTAL.” A dwelling unit or structure that is not owner-occupied
and contains 6 or fewer sleeping rooms that are available for rent or for hire

§ 120.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to accommodate the tradition of opening up
one's residence to travelers as they pass through the community. This tradition
has been brought into the 20th century in a form called "Bed and Breakfast
Establishments" or “Vacation Rentals”. This chapter is intended to encourage
the development of such facilities in the city, while at the same time
establishing minimum regulations which are intended to protect and preserve the
character of the neighborhoods in which these facilities are usually found and
to protect the traveling public. Further, this trend is seen as one way to
preserve and perhaps restore some of the city's more valuable historically and
architecturally significant structures that might otherwise be lost due to
economic conditions.
(Ord. 7508, passed 3-5-91; Am. Ord. 9043, passed 4-5-16)

amount of such judgment to the same extent that the insured would have had to
recover against the company, had the insured paid the judgment.

times. The taxicab tags issued by the City Clerk shall be of a distinctly

less than 30 days' notice in writing to the City Clerk of his intent to

   (A)   (1)   Cigarette smoking and other uses of tobacco products are
dangerous to human health;
      (2)   There exists substantial scientific evidence that the use of
tobacco products causes cancer, heart disease and various other medical
disorders;

addiction from tobacco is similar to addiction to cocaine, and is the most
widespread example of drug dependence in this country;
      (4)   The Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse has concluded
that the majority of the 320,000 Americans who die each year from cigarette
smoking became addicted to nicotine as adolescents before the age of legal
consent;
      (5)   The National Institute on Drug Abuse has found that adolescent
cigarette smoking precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug
use; and,
      (6)   The present legislative scheme of prohibiting sales of tobacco
products to persons under the age of 18 has proven ineffective in preventing
such persons from using tobacco products.
   (B)   The enactment of this chapter directly pertains to and is in
furtherance of the health, welfare and safety of the residents of the city,
particularly those residents under 18 years of age.

is physically capable of performing.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-1)
§ 130.03 POSSESSION AS VOLUNTARY ACT.
   Possession is a voluntary act if the offender knowingly procured or received
the thing possessed, or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient time
to have been able to terminate his possession.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-2)
§ 130.04 MENTAL STATE.
   (A)   A person is not guilty of an offense, other than an offense which
involves absolute liability, unless, with respect to each element described by
the section defining the offense, he acts while having one of the mental states
described in §§
130.05 through
130.08.
   (B)   If the section defining an offense prescribed a particular mental
state with respect to the offense as a whole, without distinguishing among the
elements thereof, the prescribed mental state applies to each such element. If
the section does not prescribe a particular mental state applicable to an
element of an offense (other than an offense which involves absolute
liability), any mental state defined in §§
130.05,
130.06, or
130.07 is applicable.
   (C)   Knowledge that certain conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge of

§ 130.05 INTENT.
   A person intends, or acts intentionally or with intent, to accomplish a

§ 130.06 KNOWLEDGE.
   (A)    A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:
      (1)    The nature or attendant circumstances of his conduct, described by
the section defining the offense, when he is consciously aware that his conduct
is of such nature or that such circumstances exist. Knowledge of a material
fact includes awareness of the substantial probability that such fact exists.
      (2)    The result of his conduct, described by the section defining the
offense, when he is consciously aware that such result is practically certain
to be caused by his conduct.
   (B)    Conduct performed knowingly or with knowledge is performed willfully,
within the meaning of a statute using the latter term, unless the section
clearly requires another meaning.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-5)
§ 130.07 RECKLESSNESS.
   A person is reckless or acts recklessly, when that person consciously
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or
that a result will follow, described by the section defining the offense, and
that disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation. An act performed recklessly
is performed wantonly, within the meaning of a section using the term
"wantonly", unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-6)
§ 130.08 NEGLIGENCE.
   A person is negligent, or acts negligently, when that person fails to be
aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a
result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense, and that
failure constitutes a substantial deviation from the standard of care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the situation.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-7)
§ 130.09 IGNORANCE OR MISTAKE.
   (A)    A person's ignorance or mistake as to a matter of either fact or law,
except as provided in §
130.04 (C), is a defense if it negatives the existence of the mental state
which the section prescribes with respect to an element of the offense.
   (B)    A person's reasonable belief that his conduct does not constitute an
offense is a defense if:
      (1)    The offense is defined by an administrative regulation or order
which is not known to him and has not been published or otherwise made
reasonably available to him, and he could not have acquired such knowledge by
the exercise of due diligence pursuant to facts known to him; or
      (2)    He acts in reliance upon a section which later is determined to be
invalid; or
      (3)    He acts in reliance upon an order or opinion of an Illinois
Appellate or Supreme Court, or a United States appellate court later overruled
or reversed; or
      (4)    He acts in reliance upon an official interpretation of the
section, regulation, or order defining the offense, made by a public officer or
agency legally authorized to interpret such section.
   (C)    Although a person's ignorance or mistake of fact or law, or
reasonable belief, described in this section is a defense to the offense
charged, he may be convicted of an included offense of which he would be guilty
if the fact or law were as he believed it to be.
   (D)    A defense based upon this section is an affirmative defense.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-8)
§ 130.10 ABSOLUTE LIABILITY.
   A person may be guilty of an offense without having, as to each element
thereof, one of the mental states described in §§
130.05 through
130.08 the section defining the offense clearly indicates a legislative purpose
to impose absolute liability for the conduct described.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 4-9) (Am. Ord. 8109, passed 7-5-00)
§ 130.11 ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CONDUCT OF ANOTHER.
   A person is responsible for conduct which is an element of an offense if the
conduct is either that of the person himself or that of another and he is
legally accountable for such conduct as provided in §
130.12, or both.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 5-1) ('64 Code, § 22-1)
§ 130.12 WHEN ACCOUNTABILITY EXISTS.
   A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when:
   (A)   Having a mental state described by the statute defining the offense,
he or she causes another to perform the conduct, and the other person in fact
or by reason of legal incapacity lacks such a mental state;
   (B)   The section defining the offense makes him or her so accountable; or
   (C)   Either before or during the commission of an offense, and with the
intent to promote or facilitate that commission, he or she solicits, aids,
abets, agrees, or attempts to aid, that other person in the planning or
commission of the offense. When two or more persons engage in a common criminal
design or agreement, any acts in the furtherance of that common design
committed by one party are considered to be the act of all parties to the
common design or agreement and all are equally responsible for the consequences
of those further acts. Mere presence at the scene of a crime does not render a
person accountable for an offense; a person's presence at the scene of the
crime, however, may be considered with other circumstances by the trier of fact
when determining accountability. A person is not so accountable, however,
unless the section defining the offense provides otherwise, if:
      (1)   He or she is victim of the offense committed; or
      (2)   The offense is so defined that his or her conduct was inevitably
incident to its commission; or
      (3)   Before the commission of the offense, he or she terminates his or
her effort to promote or facilitate that commission, and does one of the
following: (i) wholly deprives his or her prior efforts of effectiveness in
that commission, (ii) gives timely warning to the proper law enforcement
authorities, or (iii) otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission
of the offense.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 5-2) ('64 Code, § 22-l)

   (A)    Solicitation. A person commits the offense of solicitation when, with

maximum provided for the offense solicited.

Penalty, see § 130.99
§ 130.14 CONSPIRACY.
   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person commits the offense of conspiracy
when, with intent that an offense be committed, he or she agrees with another
to the commission of that offense. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to
commit an offense unless an act in furtherance of that agreement is alleged and
proved to have been committed by him or her or by a co-conspirator.
   (B)   Co-conspirators. It is not a defense to conspiracy that the person or
persons with whom the accused is alleged to have conspired:
      (1)   Has not been prosecuted or convicted,
      (2)   Has been convicted of a different offense,
      (3)   Is not amenable to justice,
      (4)   Has been acquitted, or
      (5)   Lacked the capacity to commit an offense.
   (C)   A person convicted of conspiracy may be fined not to exceed the
maximum provided for the offense which is the object of the conspiracy.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 8-2) (Am. Ord. 8109, passed 7-5-00)
Penalty, see § 130.99
§ 130.15 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person commits the offense of attempt when,
with intent to commit a specific offense, he or she does any act that
constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.
   (B)   Impossibility. It is not a defense to a charge of attempt that because
of a misapprehension of the circumstances it would have been impossible for the
accused to commit the offense attempted.
   (C)   A person convicted of an attempt may be fined not to exceed the
maximum provided for the offense attempted.
('64 Code, § 22-3) (Am. Ord. 8109, passed 7-5-00)

      (1)   Takes possession of, carries away, transfers or causes to be
carried away or transferred any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered
for sale in a retail mercantile establishment with the intention of retaining
such merchandise or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of
the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full
retail value of such merchandise; or
      (2)   Alters, transfers, or removes any label, price tag, marking,
indicia of value or any other markings which aid in determining value affixed
to any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail
mercantile establishment and attempts to purchase such merchandise at less than
the full retail value with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full
retail value of such merchandise; or
      (3)   Transfers any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for
sale in a retail mercantile establishment from the container in or on which
such merchandise is displayed to any other container with the intention of
depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; or
      (4)   Under-rings with the intention of depriving the merchant of the
full retail value of the merchandise; or
      (5)   Removes a shopping cart from the premises of a retail mercantile
establishment without the consent of the merchant given at the time of such
removal with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the
possession, use or benefit of such cart; or
      (6)   Represents to a merchant that he, she, or another is the lawful
owner of property, knowing that such representation is false, and conveys or
attempts to convey that property to a merchant who is the owner of the property
in exchange for money, merchandise credit or other property of the merchant; or
      (7)   Uses or possesses any theft detection shielding device or theft

the property when a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return
it to the owner, or if the lessee fails to pay the full retail value of such
property to the lessor in satisfaction of any contractual provision requiring
such, within ten days after written demand from the owner for its return. A
notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, by
registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by the lessee and shown on
the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.
   (B)   Theft by emergency exit. A person commits theft by emergency exit when
he or she commits a retail theft as defined in subdivisions (A)(1) through (8)
of this section and to facilitate the theft he or she leaves the retail
mercantile establishment by use of a designated emergency exit.
   (C)   Permissive inference. If any person:
      (1)   Conceals upon his or her person or among his or her belongings
unpurchased merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail
mercantile establishment; and
      (2)   Removes that merchandise beyond the last known station for
receiving payments for that merchandise in that retail mercantile
establishment, then the trier of fact may infer that the person possessed,
carried away or transferred such merchandise with the intention of retaining it
or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession,
use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such
merchandise.
      To "conceal" merchandise means that, although there may be some notice of
its presence, that merchandise is not visible through ordinary observation.
   (D)   Venue. Multiple thefts committed by the same person as part of a
continuing course of conduct in different jurisdictions that have been
aggregated in one jurisdiction may be prosecuted in any jurisdiction in which
one or more of the thefts occurred.
   (E)   For the purposes of this section, THEFT DETECTION SHIELDING DEVICE
means any laminated or coated bag or device designed and intended to shield
merchandise from detection by an electronic or magnetic theft alarm sensor.
   (F)   Sentence.
      (1)   A violation of any of subdivisions (A)(1) through (6) and (A)(8)
above, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property other
than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel, is a Class A misdemeanor. A violation
of subdivision (A)(7) above is a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense and a
Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent offense. Theft by emergency exit of
property, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300, is a Class 4
felony.
      (2)   A person who has been convicted of retail theft of property under
any of subdivisions (A)(1) through (6) and (A)(8) above, the full retail value
of which does not exceed $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for
motor fuel, and who has been previously convicted of any type of theft,
robbery, armed robbery, burglary, residential burglary, possession of burglary
tools, home invasion, unlawful use of a credit card, or forgery is guilty of a
Class 4 felony. A person who has been convicted of theft by emergency exit of
property, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300, and who has been
previously convicted of any type of theft, robbery, armed robbery, burglary,
residential burglary, possession of burglary tools, home invasion, unlawful use
of a credit card, or forgery is guilty of a Class 3 felony.
      (3)   Any retail theft of property under any of subdivisions (A)(1)
through (6) and (A)(8) above, the full retail value of which exceeds $300 for
property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel in a single transaction,
or in separate transactions committed by the same person as part of a
continuing course of conduct from one or more mercantile establishments over a
period of one year, is a Class 3 felony. Theft by emergency exit of property,
the full retail value of which exceeds $300 in a single transaction, or in
separate transactions committed by the same person as part of a continuing
course of conduct from one or more mercantile establishments over a period of
one year, is a Class 2 felony. When a charge of retail theft of property or
theft by emergency exit of property, the full value of which exceeds $300, is
brought, the value of the property involved is an element of the offense to be
resolved by the trier of fact as either exceeding or not exceeding $300.
(ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 16-25)
§ 132.21 DETENTION; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Detention. Any merchant who has reasonable grounds to believe that a
person has committed retail theft may detain the person, on or off the premises
of a retail mercantile establishment, in a reasonable manner and for a
reasonable length of time for all or any of the following purposes:
      (1)   To request identification;
      (2)   To verify such identification;
      (3)   To make reasonable inquiry as to whether such person has in his
possession unpurchased merchandise and to make reasonable investigation of the
ownership of such merchandise;
      (4)   To inform a peace officer of the detention of the person and
surrender that person to the custody of a peace officer;
      (5)   In the case of a minor, to immediately make a reasonable attempt to
inform the parents, guardian or other private person interested in the welfare
of that minor and, at the merchant's discretion, a peace officer, of this
detention and to surrender custody of such minor to such person.
   A merchant may make a detention as permitted in this section off the
premises of a retail mercantile establishment only if such detention is
pursuant to an immediate pursuit of such person.
   A merchant shall be deemed to have reasonable grounds to make a detention
for the purposes of this section if the merchant detains a person because such
person has in his or her possession either a theft detection shielding device
or a theft detection device remover.
   (B)   Affirmative defense. A detention as permitted in this section does not
constitute an arrest or an unlawful restraint, as defined in ILCS Ch. 720, Act
5, § 10-3, nor shall it render the merchant liable to the person so detained.
   (C)   For the purposes of this section, MINOR means a person who is less
than 19 years of age, is unemancipated, and resides with his or her parent or
parents or legal guardian.

GRAFFITI
§ 132.60 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The City Council is enacting this subchapter to help prevent the spread of
graffiti and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and
private property. The City Council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and
destructive to the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire
community. Unless the city or property owners act quickly to remove graffiti
from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other
properties then become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are
affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment
of the city. Further, the City Council desires to limit access by minors to
graffiti implements. Therefore, the City Council strongly encourages businesses
which offer graffiti implements for sale to take steps to ensure minors will
not be able to obtain such implements.

   (H)   It is unlawful for a parent, legal guardian or other person to

dollars nor more than $750, except that neither a person who has been made a
ward of the court under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 nor that person's legal
guardian shall be subject to any fine.
   (L)   If any division, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this section
is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional, such portions shall be
deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such decision shall
not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

§ 133.04 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. Minors are just as likely as adults to be involved
in a wide range of unacceptable behavior including vandalism, alcohol and drug
use, breaking and entering, damage to property and disorderly conduct. A
breakdown or loss of supervision and guidance by parents and legal guardians
contributes to minors being involved in such conduct. The city has an
obligation to provide for the protection of the general public and for the
reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activity. The city seeks to
provide such protection through enforcement of parental control over and
responsibility for minors. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts and
actions of minors is the accepted norm and legal sanctions to enforce such
responsibility has demonstrated effectiveness in increasing such responsibility
and decreasing juvenile delinquency.
   (B)   For the purposes of this section, the following words and phrases
shall have the following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
      (1)   "LEGAL GUARDIAN." A person appointed guardian, or given custody of
a minor by a Circuit Court of the state, except a person appointed guardian or
given custody of a minor under the Juvenile Court Act.
      (2)   "MINOR." A person who is not yet 18 years of age.
   (C)   The parent or legal guardian of any unemancipated minor residing with
such parent or legal guardian shall exercise reasonable and proper care and

§ 133.07 LOITERING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENGAGING IN DRUG-RELATED ACTIVITY.
   (A)   It is unlawful for any person to loiter in or near a thoroughfare,
place open to the public, or near any public or private place in a manner and
under circumstances that warrant a reasonable person to believe that the person
is manifesting the purpose to engage in drug-related activity contrary to any
provisions of: The Illinois Controlled Substances Act, ILCS Ch. 720, Act 570,
§§ 100 et seq. as amended; the Illinois Cannabis Control Act, ILCS Ch. 720, Act
550, §1 et seq. as amended; chapters 139 and 140, inclusive, of the Code of
Ordinances of the City of Danville, Illinois; or any other local, state or
federal law prohibiting the manufacture, distribution, delivery, use, or
possession of a controlled substance (hereinafter referred to as the "Drug
Laws").
   (B)   Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether
such purpose is "manifested" are the following:
      (1)   Such person is a known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller.
For purposes of this section, a "known unlawful drug user, possessor, or
seller" is a person who has, within the knowledge of the arresting officer,
been convicted in any court of any violation involving the use, possession or
sale of any of the substances referred to in the drug laws or such person has
been convicted of any of the provisions of said drug laws or substantially
similar laws of any political subdivision of this state or of any other state
or jurisdiction; or a person who displays physical characteristics of drug
intoxication or usage, such as "needle tracks"; or a person who possesses drug
paraphernalia as defined in the Illinois Drug Paraphernalia Control Act;
      (2)   Such person behaves in such a manner as to raise a reasonable
suspicion that he or she is about to engage in or is then engaged in unlawful
drug-related activity, including by way of example only, such person acting as
a "lookout";
      (3)   Such person is physically identified by the officer as a member of
a "gang" or association which has as its purpose illegal drug activity;
      (4)   Such person transfers small objects or packages for currency in a
furtive fashion;
      (5)   Such person takes flight upon the appearance of a police officer;
      (6)   Such person manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or
any object which reasonably could be involved in unlawful drug-related
activity;
      (7)   The area involved is by public repute or within the knowledge of
the arresting officer known to be an area of unlawful drug use and trafficking;
or
      (8)   The premises involved are known by public repute or within the
knowledge of the arresting officer to have been reported to law enforcement as
a place suspected of drug activity.
   (C)   Whenever a police officer observes one or more persons engaged in
activity prohibited under subsection (A) in any public place designated for the
enforcement of this section under subsection (D), the police officer shall:
      (1)   Inform all such persons that they are engaged in loitering within
an area in which such loitering is prohibited;
      (2)   Order all such persons to disperse and remove themselves from
within sight and hearing of the place at which the order was issued; and
      (3)   Inform those persons that they will be subject to arrest if they
fail to obey the order promptly or engage in further prohibited activity within
sight or hearing of the place at which the order was issued during the next
three hours.
   (D)   The Director of Public Safety or his designee shall by written
directive designate areas of the city in which enforcement of this section is
necessary because the areas are frequently associated with loitering for the
purpose of engaging in drug-related activity. Prior to making a determination
under the subsection, the Director of Public Safety or his designee shall
consult as he or she deems appropriate with persons who are knowledgeable about
the effects of narcotics-related activity in areas in which the ordinance may
be enforced. Such persons may include, but need not be limited to, members of
the police department with special training or experience related to narcotics-
related activity; other personnel of the Department or other Agency with
particular knowledge of narcotics-related activities in the proposed designated
area; elected and appointed officials of the area; and community-based
organizations. The Director of Public Safety or his designee shall develop and
implement procedures for the periodic review and update of designations made
under this subsection.
   (E)   Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be fined not
less than $100 nor more than $1,000. In addition to any fine imposed hereunder,
the offender shall be ordered to pay all costs and fees incurred by the city in
its prosecution of the offense, which shall include but not be limited to the
costs associated with an administrative adjudication proceeding or court
proceeding, and reasonable attorney's fees.

§ 135.02 OBSCENITY.
   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person commits obscenity when, with
knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he:
      (1)    Sells, delivers, or provides, or offers or agrees to sell,
deliver, or provide any obscene writing, picture, record, or other
representation or embodiment of the obscene; or
      (2)    Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other performance or

exhibition of his body for gain; or

laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
      (6)    Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)    Obscene defined. Any material or performance is obscene if: the
average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find
that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and the average
person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that it
depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or
sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated,
or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and
taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.
   (C)    Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)    Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)    Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific value.
      (3)    In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)    The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
         (b)    What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;
         (c)    The artistic, literary, scientific, educational, or other
merits of the material, or absence thereof;
         (d)    The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in
this state;
         (e)    Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material;
         (f)    Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (D)    A person convicted of obscenity shall be punished as provided in §
130.99.
   (E)    Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement, or
possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than 3 copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
disseminate.
   (F)    Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)    Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)    Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.
   (G)    Forfeiture of property. A person who has been convicted previously of
the offense of obscenity and who is convicted of a second or subsequent offense
of obscenity is subject to the property forfeiture provisions set forth in
Article 124B of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.

tenant; or
      (3)   A complaint or call for service to which the police department or

committed.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)
§ 141.03 DECLARATION OF CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTY; ACTION PLAN.
   (A)   Declaration of Chronic Nuisance Property. If a pattern of nuisance
activity exists upon real property, the City may declare the property to be a
chronic nuisance. The City must send notice to the property owner by certified
mail, return receipt requested, and by first class mail to the address listed
on the ad valorem tax roll. Notice must also be posted at the property where
the nuisance activities occurred. The declaration of chronic nuisance property
must contain at least the following information:
      (1)   A reference to this chapter, Chronic Nuisance Property Code;
      (2)   The address and parcel identification number of the property;
      (3)   The dates the nuisance activities occurred at the property;
      (4)   A description of the nuisance activities;
      (5)   A statement that the property owner is required to provide the City
with a written action plan outlining the specific measures that the property
owner will take to curtail or eliminate the reoccurrence of nuisance activities
on the property;
      (6)   A statement that the action plan must be provided to the City no
later than 15 days from the date of the declaration of chronic nuisance
property;
      (7)   A statement that failure to provide the City with a timely written
action plan will result in a violation of this chapter and the entry of a
chronic nuisance service order by a City Administrative Adjudication Hearing
Officer;
      (8)   A statement that the costs of any chronic nuisance services
provided by the City to a property that has been declared to be a chronic
nuisance will be charged to the property owner and be a lien on the real
property.
   (B)   Development of Action Plan. The property owner must provide the City
with a written action plan outlining the specific measures that the owner will
take to curtail or eliminate the re-occurrence of nuisance activities at the
property. The property owner must provide the action plan to the City no later
than 15 days from the date of the declaration of chronic nuisance property.
Failure to provide the City with a timely action plan constitutes a violation
of this chapter.
   (C)   Adequacy and implementation of Action Plan. If the City determines
that the action plan is adequate to curtail or eliminate the re-occurrence of
nuisance activities on the property, the City will notify the property owner by
sending its determination by certified mail, return receipt requested, and
first class mail. The City will establish a reasonable time period, not
exceeding 45 days from the date that the action plan is determined to be
adequate, for the property owner to implement the action plan. Failure to
implement the action plan within the time period established by the City
constitutes a violation of this chapter. If the property owner completes the
action plan within the time period established by the City and the City issues
a notice of completion, the declaration of chronic nuisance property will be
closed and no further action would be required, except if the nuisance activity
re-occurs whereupon the City could require that the property owner revise the
action plan.
   (D)   Revision of Inadequate Action Plan. If the City determines that the
action plan is not adequate to curtail or eliminate the re-occurrence of the
nuisance activities on the property, the City may require the property owner to
revise the action plan and the City will notify the property owner by sending
its determination by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class
mail. The property owner must provide a revised action plan to the City no
later than 10 days from the date that the action plan is determined to be
inadequate. Failure to revise the action plan or to provide the City with a
timely revised action plan constitutes a violation of this chapter. The
provision of an inadequate action plan on 3 consecutive occasions constitutes a
violation of this chapter and may result in the entry of a chronic nuisance
service order against the property.
   (E)   Factors determining adequacy of action plan. Factors to be considered
in determining the adequacy of an action plan may include, but are not limited
to:
      (1)   Commencement of an eviction action to remove from the property
those individuals engaged in the nuisance activity;
      (2)   Implementation of crime prevention through environmental design
(CPTED) measures;
      (3)   Frequency of site visits and inspections at various times of both
day and night;

property that are available through the records custodian of the police
department records division;
      (11)   Written documentation of all efforts to curtail or eliminate the
re-occurrence of nuisance activities on the property;
      (12)   Any other action that the City determines is reasonably sufficient
to curtail or eliminate the re-occurrence of nuisance activities on the
property.

chapter, the City must notify the property owner by certified mail, return
receipt requested, and first class mail to the address listed on the ad valorem
tax roll.

chapter;
      (3)   A statement that the property has been declared to be a chronic
nuisance;
      (4)   A statement that unless the property owner files a timely request
for hearing pursuant to §
141.05, the property owner is deemed to have waived the right to contest the
notice of violation; and
      (5)   A statement that the costs of any unpaid chronic nuisance services
provided by the city will be charged to the property owner and be a lien
against the real estate.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)
§ 141.05 REQUEST FOR HEARING.
   (A)   Request for Hearing. A property owner may request a hearing before a
City Administrative Adjudication Hearing Officer upon receipt of a declaration
of chronic nuisance property or notice of violation regarding the action plan.
A request for hearing must be filed with the City Clerk and must:
      (1)   Be in writing;
      (2)   Provide a short, plain statement identifying the factual,
procedural or legal error upon which the request for hearing is based; and
      (3)   Include a copy of the declaration of chronic nuisance property or
notice of violation.
   (B)   Time for filing a request for hearing. A request for hearing must be
filed with the City within 15 days from the date of the declaration of chronic
nuisance property or 15 days from the date of the notice of violation regarding
the action plan.
   (C)   Waiver of right to contest. If the owner of a chronic nuisance
property fails to file a timely request for hearing, the property owner is
deemed to have waived the right to contest the declaration of chronic nuisance
property or notice of violation.
   (D)   Hearing. Upon receipt of a timely request, the City must schedule a
hearing. The hearing is limited to a review of the record or evidence upon
which the City based its declaration of chronic nuisance property, including
any evidence submitted by the property owner to rebut the City's evidence; or
notice of violation regarding the action plan.
   (E)   Decision. After reviewing the record and evidence upon which the City
based its determination and the evidence submitted by the property owner, the
Hearing Officer must either uphold or reject the declaration of chronic
nuisance property or notice of violation regarding the action plan, as
appropriate. The decision of the Hearing Officer must be in writing and is
deemed final. If the Hearing Officer upholds the notice of violation, the
Hearing Officer must immediately enter a chronic nuisance service order under §
141.06. If the Hearing Officer rejects the notice of violation, the Hearing
Officer must identify the factual, procedural, or legal error upon which the
decision is based. Notwithstanding, the property owner must submit and
implement an action plan under §
141.03 if the Hearing Officer finds that a pattern of nuisance activity
occurred at the property.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)
§ 141.06 ENTRY OF CHRONIC NUISANCE SERVICE ORDER.
   (A)   Chronic Nuisance Service Order. If a timely request for hearing has
not been filed under §
141.05 and a notice of violation has been issued, the Hearing Officer must
enter a chronic nuisance service order. If the Hearing Officer upholds the
declaration of chronic nuisance property or determines after a hearing that
there has been a failure to provide or implement an adequate action plan, the
Hearing Officer must enter a chronic nuisance service order. The City must send
a copy of the chronic nuisance service order to the property owner by certified
mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to the address listed on
the ad valorem tax roll. The chronic nuisance service order must:
      (1)   Enter findings of fact establishing a pattern of nuisance activity
and violation of this chapter;
      (2)   Authorize the City to provide chronic nuisance services to the
property;
      (3)   Authorize the City to bill the costs of any chronic nuisance
services to the owner of the chronic nuisance property;
      (4)   Provide for the mailing of a copy of the chronic nuisance service
order by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to any
mortgagee of record. Failure to provide a copy of a chronic nuisance service
order to a mortgagee of record does not operate to release or discharge any
obligation under this chapter or otherwise affect the validity of a chronic
nuisance service order;
      (5)   Provide for recording a certified copy of the chronic nuisance
service order in the public records; and
      (6)   Provide for continuing jurisdiction over the chronic nuisance
property.
   (B)   Duration of Chronic Nuisance Service Order. The chronic nuisance
service order entered in accordance with this section shall terminate if there
have been no nuisance activities at the property for a period of one year.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)
§ 141.07 ABATEMENT OF CHRONIC NUISANCES; PROVISION OF SERVICES; APPORTIONMENT.
   (A)   Abatement by City. The City may abate chronic nuisances on real
property by providing chronic nuisance services to curtail or eliminate the re-
occurrence of nuisance activities. The costs of these chronic nuisance services
shall be billed to the property owner under Section
141.08 and these costs may be collected by the City by any legal means. Failure
to comply with Section
141.08 does not excuse payment of the debt and may be cured by complying with
Section
141.08 or evidence of actual notice of the claim.
   (B)   Apportionment. Chronic nuisance service costs shall be entirely
apportioned to the assessed real property receiving the chronic nuisance
services.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)
§ 141.08 BILLING OF COSTS; NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY.
   (A)   Billing of chronic nuisance service costs. The City may bill all
chronic nuisance service costs to the owner of the chronic nuisance property by
sending a bill certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail
to the address listed on the ad valorem tax roll. The bill must contain at
least the following information:
      (1)   The address and parcel identification number of the chronic
nuisance property;
      (2)   The date of each chronic nuisance service;
      (3)   A brief description of each chronic nuisance service;
      (4)   The total costs of each chronic nuisance service;
      (5)   A statement that the total amount of the bill must be paid to the
City within 30 days from the date of the bill and that any chronic nuisance
service cost which has not been paid within 30 days from the date of the bill
is delinquent.
      (6)   A statement that any unpaid chronic nuisance service cost shall be
a lien against the property.
   (B)   Notice of Delinquency. The property owner must pay the total amount of
the bill to the City within 30 days from the date of the bill. Any chronic
nuisance service cost which has not been paid within 30 days from the date of
the bill is delinquent. If the property owner fails to pay the total amount of
the bill within 30 days from the date of the bill, the City may notify the
property owner of the delinquency. The City must send the notice of delinquency
by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to the
address listed on the ad valorem tax roll and the notice of delinquency must
contain at least the following information:
      (1)   The address and parcel identification number of the property;
      (2)   The amount of the delinquent billings, specifying each chronic
nuisance service cost and the total of all chronic nuisance service costs
incurred;
      (3)   A statement that any unpaid chronic nuisance service costs shall be
a lien against the property.
   (C)   Construction of Chronic Nuisance Service Cost. Chronic nuisance
service costs must not include any amount attributable to general law
enforcement activities or the general enforcement of municipal codes upon a
property that has not been declared by the City to be a chronic nuisance and
that has not received a chronic nuisance service order from a Hearing Officer.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)
§ 141.09 METHOD OF NOTICE; CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Notice. Whenever required, notice may be:
      (1)   Delivered personally, with a certificate of service; or
      (2)   Sent by first-class mail, or by Federal Express or UPS addressed to
the last known address listed on the ad valorem tax roll.
      (3)   Notice must be posted at the property where the nuisance activities
occurred.
   (B)   Notice is final immediately upon posting, personal service and three
days after posting in the United States mail or with Federal Express or UPS.
   (C)   Construction of Notice of Violation. A property owner is deemed to
have notice of a nuisance activity if that property owner:
      (1)   Has actual knowledge of the nuisance activity;
      (2)   Has received notice of the nuisance activity;
      (3)   Has reason to know about the nuisance activity;
      (4)   Knows about a fact or facts related to the nuisance activity; or
      (5)   Is able to ascertain the existence of a nuisance by inspecting the
property or by checking an official filing or record. The lack of knowledge of,
acquiescence or participation in, or responsibility for a nuisance activity on
the part of the property owner is not a defense to any enforcement of this
chapter.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)
§ 141.10 CHANGE IN TITLE TO CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTY.
   (A)   Purchase at judicial sale; tax deed. Every purchaser of a chronic
nuisance property at judicial sale upon a final judgment of foreclosure and
every person or entity which receives a tax deed to a chronic nuisance property
must provide the City with an action plan and implement an action plan no later
than 45 days from acquiring the property.
   (B)   Receivership. Every trustee or receiver of a chronic nuisance property
appointed after the entry of a chronic nuisance service order must provide the
City with an action plan and implement the action plan no later than 45 days
from the date of appointment as trustee or receiver over the property.
   (C)   Probate. Every personal representative of an owner of a chronic
nuisance property must provide the City with an action plan and implement an
action plan no later than 45 days from the date of appointment. If the owner of
the chronic nuisance property died intestate, beneficiaries of the estate must
provide the City with an action plan and implement an action plan within 45
days of the City notifying any of the beneficiaries.
   (D)   Other changes in title to chronic nuisance property. An arms-length
purchaser of a chronic nuisance property that has purchased the property after
entry of a chronic nuisance service order for the property has 45 days from the
date of closing or recording of the order, whichever occurs last, to provide
the City with an action plan and implement the action plan.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)
§ 141.11 CONSTRUCTION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   Authority to act. This chapter shall not be construed to limit the
City's authority to act under its Building Code or Property Maintenance Code.
   (B)   Imposition of administrative fines or penalties. The chapter shall not
be construed to limit the City from imposing administrative fines or any other
penalties afforded within the City Code.
(Ord. 9050, passed 5-3-16)

142.03   Severability

§ 142.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have
the following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   (A)   “ABORTION” means the act of using, prescribing, administering,
procuring, or selling of any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other
substance, device, or means with the purpose to terminate the pregnancy of a
woman, with knowledge that the termination by any of those means will with
reasonable likelihood cause the death of an unborn child. The term does not
include:
      (1)   In vitro fertilization or fertility treatments of any type;
      (2)   The use, prescription, administration, procuring, or selling of
Plan B, morning-after pills, intrauterine devices, or any other type of
contraception or emergency contraception; or
      (3)   An act performed with the purpose to:
         (a)   Save the life or preserve the health of the unborn child;
         (b)   Remove a dead unborn child caused by spontaneous abortion; or

   (B)   “HOSPITAL” means an institution that is:
      (1)   Primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of
physicians, inpatient diagnostic and therapeutic services or rehabilitation

   (C)   “INTERACTIVE COMPUTER SERVICE” means any information service, system,

multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system
that provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or services
offered by libraries or educational institutions.
   (D)   “MEDICAL EMERGENCY” means a life-threatening physical condition
aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that, as certified by a
physician, places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial
impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.
   (E)   “WOMAN” and “WOMEN” include any person whose biological sex is female,
including any person with XX chromosomes and any person with a uterus,
regardless of any gender identity that the person may attempt to assert or
claim.
(Ord. 9432, passed 5-2-23)
§ 142.02 COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL ABORTION LAWS REQUIRED.
   (A)   Except as provided by subsection (D), it shall be unlawful for any
person to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1461 by using the mails for the mailing, carriage
in the mails, or delivery of:
      (1)   Any article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing
abortion;
or
      (2)   Any article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or thing which
is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or
apply it for producing abortion;
   (B)   Except as provided by subsection (D), it shall be unlawful for any
person to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1462 by:
      (1)   Using any express company or other common carrier or interactive
computer service for carriage in interstate or foreign commerce of any drug,
medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing
abortion;
      (2)   Knowingly taking or receiving, from such express company or other
common carrier or interactive computer service, any matter or thing described
in subsection (B)(1).
   (C)   Except as provided by subsection (D), it shall be unlawful for any
person to engage in conduct that aids or abets the violations of 18 U.S.C. §
1461 or 18 U.S.C. § 1462 described in subsection (A).
   (D)   This section shall not apply to any conduct taken by a hospital, or by
any employees, agents, or contractors of a hospital, that is necessary to
ensure that a licensed physician is prepared to perform an abortion in response
to a medical emergency.
   (E)   No provision of this section may be construed to prohibit any conduct
protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as made applicable
to state and local governments through the Supreme Court’s interpretation of
the Fourteenth Amendment, or by article 1, section 4 of the Illinois
Constitution.
   (F)   Under no circumstance may the mother of the unborn child that has been
aborted, or the pregnant woman who seeks to abort her unborn child, be subject
to prosecution or penalty under this section.
   (G)   Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this section
shall be fined $750 for each offense. In addition to any fine imposed under
this chapter, the offender shall be ordered to pay all of the costs and fees
incurred by the City in prosecuting the violation, which shall include but not
be limited to the costs associated with an administrative adjudication
proceeding or court proceeding, and reasonable attorney’s fees.
(Ord. 9432, passed 5-2-23)
§ 142.03 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which in the
context of determining the severability of a state statute regulating abortion
the Supreme Court of the United States held that an explicit statement of
legislative intent is controlling, it is the intent of the City Council that
every provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this
chapter, and every
application of the provisions in this chapter to every person, group of
persons, or circumstances, are severable from each other.
   (B)   If any application of any provision in this chapter to any person,
group of persons, or circumstances is found by any court to be invalid,
preempted, or unconstitutional, for any reason whatsoever, then the remaining
applications of that provision to all other persons and circumstances shall be
severed and preserved, and shall remain in effect. All constitutionally valid
applications of the provisions in this chapter shall be severed from any
applications that a court finds to be invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional,
because it is the City Council’s intent and priority that every single valid
application of every provision in this chapter be allowed to stand alone.
   (C)   The City Council further declares that it would have enacted this
chapter, and each provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
word, and all constitutional applications of the provisions of this chapter,
irrespective of the fact that any provision, section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase, or word, or applications of this chapter were to be declared
invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional.
   (D)   If any provision of this chapter is found by any court to be
unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision that do not
present constitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in force,
consistent with the severability requirements of subsections (A), (B), and (C).
   (E)   No court may decline to enforce the severability requirements of
subsections (A), (B), (C), and (D) on the ground that severance would “rewrite”
the ordinance or involve the court in legislative or lawmaking activity. A
court that declines to enforce or enjoins a state or local official from
enforcing a statute or ordinance is never rewriting the underlying law or
engaging in legislative or lawmaking activity, as the statute or ordinance
continues to contain the same words as before the court’s decision. A judicial
injunction or declaration of unconstitutionality:
      (1)   Is nothing more than an edict prohibiting enforcement that may
subsequently be vacated by a later court if that court has a different
understanding of the requirements of the Illinois Constitution or United States
Constitution;
      (2)   Is not a formal amendment of the language in a statute or
ordinance; and
      (3)   No more rewrites a statute or ordinance than a decision by the
executive not to enforce a duly enacted statute in a limited and defined set of
circumstances.
   (F)   If any court, including any state or federal court, disregards any of
the severability requirements in subsections (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E), and
declares or finds any provision of this chapter facially invalid, preempted, or
unconstitutional, when there are discrete applications of that provision can be
enforced against a person, group of persons, or circumstances without violating
federal or state law or the federal or state constitutions, then that provision
shall be interpreted, as a matter of city law, as if the City Council had
enacted a provision limited to the persons, group of persons, or circumstances
for which the provision’s application will not violate federal or state law or
the federal or state constitutions, and every court shall adopt this saving
construction of that provision until the court ruling that pronounced the
provision facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional is vacated or
overruled.
(Ord. 9432, passed 5-2-23)
§ 142.04 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter shall take effect when the city of Danville obtains a
declaratory judgment from a court that it may enact and enforce an ordinance
requiring compliance with the abortion-related provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1461
and 18 U.S.C. § 1462, however those statutes are interpreted by the court, and
the declaratory judgment becomes final upon the conclusion of direct appeals.

§ 150.015 INTENT AND PURPOSE OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   AG Agriculture District. The AG District is intended to encompass
areas where soil, water, vegetative, and topographical conditions are well
suited for the raising of crops and livestock or where essential public
facilities or services do not yet or are not reasonably expected to serve the
property in the near future. The purpose of this District is to facilitate
orderly and efficient urban development by preventing the inappropriate and
untimely intrusion of non-agricultural land uses into such areas. As
development pressures dictate, certain areas within this District as
recommended in the City's Comprehensive Plan may be rezoned to open additional
lands for development. This District is also intended to encompass natural
resource and open space areas and to provide for the preservation and
protection of such areas.
   (B)   RR Rural Residential District. The RR District is intended to
encompass areas outside the corporate limits but within the City's zoning area
that are unsuitable for agricultural production and are not valuable areas for
natural resources or open space and in which public facilities and services
cannot reasonably be expected to serve in the future. The purpose of this
District is to maintain the viability of such areas while also supplying an
option to urban living by providing low density residential development of
these areas in the form of single family dwellings at densities up to one
dwelling unit per three acres. This District is also intended to encompass and
preserve existing areas of low density rural residential development that have
previously been developed in the absence of essential public facilities or
services.
   (C)   R-1 Single Family Residential - Low Density District. The R-1 District
is intended to encompass areas inside the corporate limits, but on the
perimeter of the community, where the creation and maintenance of stable and
enduring residential neighborhoods can take advantage of existing public
facilities and services while avoiding conflicts with natural features and
incompatible uses. The purpose of this District is to encourage and protect
single family residential neighborhoods and the land uses which are compatible
with them by providing for the establishment of residential development areas
that are characterized almost exclusively by single family detached dwellings
on medium to large lots at densities ranging from three to five dwelling units
per acre.
   (D)   R-2 Single Family Residential - Medium Density District. The R-
2 District is intended to encompass areas within the community where
established residential neighborhoods exist and where the maintenance of stable
and enduring residential neighborhoods can take advantage of existing public
facilities and services and existing development while avoiding conflicts with
natural features and incompatible uses. The purpose of this District is to
encourage and protect single family residential neighborhoods and the land uses
which are compatible with them by providing residential development areas that
are characterized primarily by single family detached dwellings on medium lots
at densities ranging from six to eight dwelling units per acre.
   (E)   R-3 Mixed Residential District. The R-3 District is intended to
encompass areas within the community adjacent to the downtown core where the
community's oldest residential neighborhoods exist and where greater
concentrations of residences can take full advantage of existing public
facilities and services and can directly support the downtown core, while
preserving the unique historical and architectural fabric of such areas. The
purpose of this District is to encourage the preservation of the community's
oldest residential neighborhoods in order to facilitate the renaissance of such
areas and of the downtown area as a whole. This District provides and preserves
residential development areas that are characterized primarily by medium
density residential development that consists of a mixture of single family
dwellings, two family dwellings and low intensity multi-family dwellings with
average neighborhood densities ranging from six to eight dwelling units per
acre. The defining traditional neighborhood design elements that are present in
such areas should be preserved and enhanced and new development in such areas
should incorporate these elements in keeping with the character of the
neighborhood.
   (F)   R-4 Multiple Family Residential - High Density District. The R-
4 District is intended to encompass areas within the community that are
adjacent to centers of activity or near high traffic corridors where high
concentrations of residences can take advantage of existing public facilities
and services and can support such centers of activity, while reducing travel
distances and supplying a transitional buffer between non-residential areas and
surrounding single family residential areas. The purpose of this District is to
provide for the development of multi-family housing within specific areas of
the community in order to make a variety of housing types available to meet the
housing needs of the community. This District provides residential development
areas that are characterized primarily by multiple family dwellings at
densities greater than eight dwelling units per acre.
   (G)   MHP Mobile Home Park District. The MHP District is intended to
encompass select areas within the City's zoning area where a mobile home park
development could be served by essential public facilities and services and can
complement existing development while avoiding conflicts with natural features
and other developments. The purpose of this District is to provide for the
development of mobile home parks within specific areas of the community in
order to make another type of housing available to meet the needs of the
community. This District provides residential development areas characterized
almost exclusively by mobile homes and manufactured homes at densities up to
five dwelling units per acre.
   (H)   P-1 Professional Office District. The P-1 District is intended to
encompass areas within the community that are adjacent to centers of activity
or near high traffic corridors and where such development can take advantage of
the surrounding concentrations of activity while serving as a transitional
buffer between residential areas and non-residential uses that are incompatible
with residential districts. The purpose of this District is to encourage the
establishment of office developments of varying scales within specific areas of
the community in order to facilitate development areas specifically designed
for businesses that serve the specialized care and other professional service
needs of the community or the region. This District is characterized by
development consisting predominately of office buildings of a low intensity
that lack the off-site impacts typically created by and associated with
commercial developments.
   (I)   B-1 Neighborhood Business District. The B-1 District is intended to
encompass select areas within the community that are on the edge of or between
established residential neighborhoods with such areas typically positioned
adjacent to arterial or collector streets and designed so as to accommodate a
combination of automobile and pedestrian traffic. The purpose of this District
is to provide for the establishment of small scale commercial developments
within specific areas of the community in order to encourage and facilitate
commercial activity that serves the neighborhoods in which the development is
located. This District is characterized by low intensity commercial development
that consists of a limited range of service and retail uses. Some buildings may
also contain a mix of uses with ground floor retail and second story offices or
residential units. These areas should not be extensive in size, nor should they
generate substantial amounts of vehicular traffic and the level of evening
business activity should be kept to a minimum.
   (J)   B-2 Highway Business District. The B-2 District is intended to
encompass select areas within the community that are along high traffic
corridors and designed so as to accommodate the needs of customers that are
primarily motorists passing on the roadway. The purpose of this District is to
provide for the establishment of medium sized commercial development within
specific areas of the community in order to accommodate commercial activity
that is designed to be served primarily by automobile traffic. This District is
characterized by low intensity commercial development that consists of a mix of
certain retail and service uses which typically satisfy the convenience needs
of the traveling public.
   (K)   B-3 General Business District. The B-3 District is intended to
encompass select areas within the community that are most suitable to
accommodate the impacts of more intense commercial development and is designed
to be served by a combination of automobile and pedestrian traffic. The purpose
of this District is to provide for the establishment of medium and large scale
commercial development within selected areas of the community in order to
accommodate a wider variety of commercial uses at intensities greater than that
of the B-2 District but less than that of the B-4 District. This District is
characterized by medium intensity commercial development that consists of a
wide variety of commercial uses which serve the whole community and in some
instances the region. Given the size and intensity of developments within such
areas, off-site impacts can be significant and need to be minimized to achieve
compatibility with adjoining districts.
   (L)   B-4 Central Business District. The B-4 District is intended to
encompass a select area within the community that is centrally located and that
functions as the commerce and activity hub for the community and is designed so
as to be a compact and pedestrian oriented downtown core. The purpose of this
District is to provide for the development of a densely developed central
business area that acts as the focal point of the community and serves as the
center of government while providing space for a variety of professional,
service and retail uses as well as entertainment and residences. The central
business district differs from neighborhood business areas only in intensity
and location. This District is characterized by high intensity mixed use
development that consists of a variety of different uses that serve the
downtown area and to an extent the community as a whole. This area should be
compact and pedestrian oriented with no front or side setbacks and parking
needs met on street or in public lots.
   (M)   I-1 Light Industrial District. The I-1 District is intended to
encompass select areas within the community where a satisfactory combination of
such factors as adequate topographical conditions, proximity to transportation
facilities, accessibility for employees, efficient land assembly, and adequate
public facilities and utilities that may be required by industrial uses, can be
achieved. The purpose of this District is to provide for the establishment of
less intensive areas of industrial development within specific areas of the
community in order to accommodate assembly and warehousing activities at a
scale and intensity of use compatible with adjacent areas. This District is
characterized by low to medium intensity industrial development that consists
primarily of businesses which assemble or warehouse products for sale and
distribution to markets outside the community, but in which no manufacturing
activity is conducted.
   (N)   I-2 General Industrial District. The I-2 District is intended to
encompass select areas within the community where a satisfactory combination of
such factors as adequate topographical conditions, proximity to transportation
facilities, accessibility for employees, efficient land assembly, and adequate
public facilities and utilities that may be required by industrial uses, can be
achieved without creating incompatibilities with surrounding non-industrial
development and uses. The purpose of this District is to provide for the
establishment of larger scale, higher intensity areas of industrial development
within specific areas of the community in order to accommodate any type of
manufacturing, processing, fabricating, assembling or warehousing operations
which generally exhibit higher levels of objectionable external effects and
ensure they are carried out in a manner that will not endanger the public
health, safety, and general welfare. Such areas should not be located adjacent
to residential districts. This District is characterized by medium to high
intensity industrial development that consists primarily of industrial uses
that manufacture, process, fabricate, assemble or warehouse products for sale
and distribution to markets outside the community.

   (B)   Classification of Home Occupations. A home occupation shall be
considered an accessory use to any residential dwelling unit and permitted
subject to the following regulations. For the purpose of this chapter, home
occupations shall be further classified as either a minor, major or prohibited
home occupation. Home occupations complying with the general requirements and
the standards established in subsection (D) below shall be considered minor in
character and permitted by right with no further approval required. Home
occupations that are considered major home occupations shall be permitted by
right in all non-residential zoning districts, but shall require a special use
permit in a residential zoning district.
   (C)   General Requirements. All home occupations shall be subject to the
following requirements:

occupation be conducted in a manner which would cause the premises to differ
from its residential character.

      (5)   No activity shall be allowed which would interfere with radio or
television transmission in the area, nor shall there be any offensive noise,
vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat or glare noticeable at or beyond the lot
line.
      (6)   There shall not be conducted on the premises the business of
selling stocks of merchandise, supplies, or products, provided that orders
previously made by telephone or at a sales party may be filled on the premises,
i.e., direct sales of products off display shelves or racks is not allowed, but
a person may pick up an order placed earlier as described above; and incidental
retail sales may be made in connection with the home occupation; e.g., a
single-chair beauty parlor would be allowed to sell combs, hair spray, and
other miscellaneous items to their customers. However, a dressmaker would be
required to do only custom work for specific clients, and would not be allowed
to develop stocks of dresses for sale to the general public on-site.
      (7)   Deliveries from commercial suppliers shall not be received more
than once a week and the deliveries shall not be made by semi-trailer trucks.

for parking needs generated by providing one additional space for each 300
square feet of floor area used for the home occupation.
   (D)   Minor Home Occupations. Any activity that meets but does not exceed
the following standards shall be classified as a minor home occupation:
      (1)   No person who is not a resident of the dwelling unit may be
employed on the lot in connection with the home occupation.
      (2)   No customers or clients shall be permitted on the lot in connection
with the home occupation.
      (3)    No more than one room of the dwelling unit may be used for the
home occupation.
      (4)   There shall be no advertising, display, or other indications of a
home occupation on the premises.
      (5)   Permitted minor home occupations may include, but are not
necessarily limited to, the following: artists and sculptors; authors and

§ 150.048 SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS.
   (A)   A Solar Energy System may be considered either a principal or an
accessory use. Another principal use of a building on the same lot shall not
preclude the installation of a solar energy system on such lot.
      (1)   Small scale ground mounted solar energy systems and roof mounted
solar energy systems shall be regulated as accessory structures and allowed in
all zoning districts with the establishment of such structures subject to the
applicable requirements of this Section and of §
150.030(A) and (B).
      (2)   Large scale ground mounted solar energy systems shall be regulated
as principal uses with the establishment of such uses subject to requirements
of this Section and the District Regulations of §§
150.020 and
150.021.
   (B)   Glare. Solar energy systems shall be designed and located to avoid
significant glare or reflection onto adjacent properties and adjacent roadways
and shall not interfere with traffic or create a safety hazard. This may be
accomplished by both the placement and angle of the collection devices as well
as human-made or environmental barriers. Glare intensity is considered
significant if it measures more than 20% of the incident sun intensity. The
potential for glare and remediation of glare shall be quantified in the initial
materials submitted for system review and approval.
   (C)   Buffering. Large scale ground mounted solar energy systems abutting a
residential zoning district shall include a buffer strip not less than one
hundred (100) feet wide. Such buffer strip shall be landscaped and planted with
a combination of shrubs, trees or other plants which provide a visual and
acoustic screen, and may contain fences, or ornamental and acoustic walls.
   (D)   Aesthetics. All solar energy system wiring shall be neatly grouped,
routed and continuously supported. Solar energy systems should blend into the
architecture of the building where they are located if mounted on a building.
Solar energy systems, to the extent practical, should limit visibility from the
right of way.
   (E)   Monitoring and Maintenance. The system owner or operator shall
maintain the solar energy system in good condition. Maintenance shall include,
but is not be limited to, painting, structural repairs, and integrity of
security measures.

advertising or signage, including streamers, pennants, spinners, flags,
reflectors, ribbons, balloons-banners, or other similar materials.
   (G)   Roof mounted solar energy systems installed on a sloped roof of a
building shall not project vertically above the peak of the roof. Solar panels
attached to a flat roof shall not project vertically more than 10 feet above
the roof. Solar panels attached to the side of a structure shall not project
vertically above the building height allowed for that zoning district.
   (H)   Small-scale ground mounted solar energy systems, where the solar
panels are attached to the ground by a pole, metal frame or other similar
support structure, shall comply with existing regulations for accessory
structures but in no instance shall such systems exceed fifteen (15) feet in
height in residential zoning districts.
   (I)   Safety. Roof mounted solar energy systems shall be located in such a
manner as to ensure emergency access to the roof, provide pathways to specific
areas of the roof, provide for smoke ventilation opportunities, and provide
emergency egress from the roof. To the extent practicable, the access pathway
shall be located at a structurally strong location on the building (such as a
bearing wall). No roof mounted solar energy system shall be located in a manner
that would cause the shedding of ice or snow from the roof into a porch,
stairwell or pedestrian travel area.
   (J)   Large scale solar energy systems shall have power lines routed
underground to the extent practical.
   (K)   Quality and Disposal. All solar panels used as a part of a solar
energy system shall be certified to meet the US EPA Toxicity Characteristic
Leaching Procedure Standards (TCLP). Disposal of solar panels after replacement
or abandonment shall follow Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
requirements where applicable.
   (L)   Abandonment. Any ground mounted solar energy system that is no longer
being utilized as such shall be disassembled and removed by the system owner
within 90 days after notice from the City to remove the system. If the owner of
the abandoned system cannot be located or is no longer in business, the
requirements of this Section shall be the responsibility of the landowner on
whose lot the system is located. Decommissioning shall consist of physical
removal of all solar energy systems, structures, equipment, security barriers
and transmission lines from the site and stabilization or re-vegetation of the
site as necessary to minimize erosion.

construction of such improvements, the lot shall be considered one lot.
   (E)   Division of lots. No improved lot shall hereafter be divided into two
or more lots and no part of a lot shall be sold unless all resultant lots
conform to all lot requirements for the district in which the lots are located.
   (F)   Exception to minimum lot area and width. A lot of record that does not
meet the minimum lot area and/or width requirements for the zoning district in
which it is located may still be improved provided the lot has a lot width of
at least 40 feet at the building line and is at least 5,000 square feet in
area, and can provide side yards (when required) of at least five feet and can
meet all other bulk requirements of this Ordinance.

   (B)   Visibility triangle at intersections. On corner lots, no obstruction
greater than five inches in diameter or higher than 30 inches above the
centerline grade of the intersecting streets, shall be permitted in the
following described triangle area of any required front yard. The visibility
triangle shall be as follows: from the corner property pin at the intersection
of the two street right-of-way lines, measure along the property lines a
distance of 20 feet to form the legs of the triangle, then connect those two
end points to close the triangle. In addition, at any intersection involving a
collector or arterial street as designated in the City's Comprehensive Plan,
the visibility triangle shall increase to 30 feet. This requirement will be
waived only if the subject intersection is signalized to assure safety.

for any other lot, either through change of ownership or other means, if the
portion to be reallocated would cause the original lot to fall below the
minimum requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   Yards for common lot line dwellings. Each lot which contains a common
lot line dwelling unit shall be considered separate and independent from
adjoining common lot line dwelling units for the purpose of determining front

supplied collectively shall not be less than 85% of the sum of the requirements
computed separately and provided the provisions of this section governing the
location of off-street parking are fully complied with.
      (3)   In the case of uses where floor area is the unit for determining
the required number of off-street parking spaces, floor area shall mean the
gross floor area as defined in §
150.010, but exclusive of such floor areas the Zoning Administrator determines
to be utility equipment rooms or storage closets.

SIGNS
§ 150.100 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to protect the public
safety, enhance the City's physical appearance and promote orderly development
of the community through the regulation of signs and sign structures.
   (B)   Regulation. All signs hereafter constructed, erected, or otherwise
established, moved, altered or changed shall comply with the regulations
contained herein. Signs shall be specifically regulated by this subchapter on
the basis of the following factors:
      (1)   The Zoning District in which the sign is displayed,
      (2)   The type of sign,
      (3)   The size of the sign,
      (4)   The height of the sign from the ground,
      (5)   The spacing between signs,
      (6)   The illumination and animation of a sign,
      (7)   The classification of the sign as either an on-premise or off-
premise sign.
   (C)   Conformance to codes. Any sign hereafter erected shall conform to the
provisions of this chapter and the provisions of the adopted building code and
of any other applicable ordinance or regulation of the City.
   (D)   General sign types. Sign types allowed shall be as described within
this subchapter and depicted in
Appendix C, attached to and made a part of this chapter.
   (E)   Computation of sign area. The area of a sign face shall be computed by
determining the area of the smallest convex geometric figure that can encompass
the sign, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the
background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop
or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting
framework or bracing. The computation of sign area is illustrated for various
sign types in
Appendix C of this chapter. For the purposes of computing sign area, a sign
with two facings shall be computed as a single sign face if the two facings are
erected at no greater than a 45 degree angle, for a v-type sign, or the
distance between the backs of each facing does not exceed three feet for a
double sided sign.
   (F)   Computation of sign heights. The height of a sign shall be computed by
determining the distance from the top of the highest portion of the sign or
structure to the grade at the foundation of the sign or the average grade of
the lot, whichever is less. This is illustrated for various sign types in
Appendix C.
   (G)   Computation of lot frontage. If a lot contains walls facing more than
one property line or encompasses property frontage bounded by more than one
street, the sign area for each building wall or property frontage will be
computed separately. The sign area thus calculated shall be permitted to then
be applied to permitted signs placed on each separate wall or property line
frontage.
   (H)   Setbacks for freestanding signs. All pylon and monument style
freestanding signs shall be setback a minimum of five feet from all property
lot lines.
   (I)   Signs in public right-of-way. No sign, other than an official traffic
sign or similar sign, shall be erected in a public right-of-way or encroach
onto a public right-of-way, unless specifically authorized by other ordinances
or regulations of the City or by specific authorization of the Zoning
Administrator.
   (J)   Projections over public right-of-way. Signs projecting over public
right-of-way shall be permitted to do so only in compliance with the
projections and clearance limits set forth in §
150.107.
   (K)   Traffic visibility. No sign or sign structure shall be erected at the
intersection of any streets in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear
vision, nor at any location where by its position, shape, or color it may
interfere with or obstruct the view of or be confused with any authorized
traffic sign, signal or device.
   (L)   Maintenance and repair. Every sign permitted by this chapter shall be
kept in good condition and repair. When any sign becomes insecure, in danger of
falling or is otherwise deemed unsafe by the Zoning Administrator, the owner or
user of the sign shall make such sign conform to the provisions of this chapter
or shall remove it within 15 days of a written notification from the Zoning
Administrator.
   (M)   Removal of abandoned signs. Any sign that no longer advertises or
identifies a use conducted on the property on which said sign is erected must
have the sign copy removed and replaced with a blank white face within 30 days
of a written notification from the Zoning Administrator. Any freestanding sign
that is non-conforming and that no longer advertises or identifies a use
conducted on the property on which said sign is erected must have all sign copy
and the sign structure, in its entirety, removed within 30 days of a written
notification from the Zoning Administrator.
   (N)   Noncommercial signs and messages. Any sign that can be displayed under
the provisions of this subchapter may contain a noncommercial message.

with an official traffic sign, signal or device, or obstruct or interfere with
a driver's view of approaching, merging or intersecting traffic.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 150.120 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Planned Unit Developments. The term Planned Unit Development refers to
a type of development which incorporates either a single use or a mixture of
uses that are planned and developed as a unit. The Planned Unit Development
classification acts as an overlay zone. With this approach, the overall
intensity of a development is consistent with the underlying zoning district
and the Comprehensive Plan. These Planned Unit Development (PUD) regulations
provide design flexibility that may be desired, but is not available through
the application of the standard Zoning Districts established by this chapter.
Such flexibility requires a review process and detailed development plans. In
exchange for flexibility, PUDs may be required to provide amenities not
otherwise required through traditional zoning techniques. This requirement is
designed to offset the impact of changes in development standards allowed
through these provisions such as mixed land uses, increased open space and
reduced setbacks. Because of the complex nature of Planned Unit Developments,
specific procedures, standards, fees and exceptions are hereby established to
govern PUDs.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of these Planned Unit Development regulations is
to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design for land
developments than is possible under the more conventional zoning regulations of
this chapter. The Planned Unit Development designation also provides for a more
efficient use of land and thus results in more economical physical development.
   (C)   Intent. The Planned Unit Development method is intended to:
      (1)   Promote a creative approach to the use of land and related physical
facilities that results in better design and development;
      (2)   Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms and
building relationships with a possible mixing of different urban uses in an
innovative design;
      (3)   Promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification in
the location of structures;
      (4)   Promote an efficient use of land to facilitate a more economic
arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses and utilities, and the
conservation of energy;
      (5)   Preserve to the greatest extent possible the existing landscape
features and amenities, and to utilize such features in a harmonious fashion;
      (6)   Create a method for the permanent preservation of common open space
for the continued use and enjoyment of the residents of the development;
      (7)   Provide for more usable and suitably located recreation facilities,
schools, and other public and private facilities;
      (8)   Allow development, under a specifically approved design concept and
site plan, which otherwise may not be permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
   (D)    Size & Location. The site of a PUD must be at least two acres in area
and of reasonable dimensions to allow a practical arrangement of improvements,
open spaces and land uses. A PUD shall front on an arterial or collector
roadway as defined in the City's Comprehensive Plan. Under no circumstances
shall a single PUD lie on two sides of an existing public street or alley.
   (E)   Ownership. The site of a PUD must be under single ownership and/or
unified control prior to application for a PUD approval.
   (F)   Permitted Uses. The particular uses included in a proposed PUD are
subject to the review and approval procedures specified herein, and shall not
be deemed to be permitted by right. All uses permitted in the PUD may be mixed.
The mixture of uses must be arranged in such a way as to ensure compatibility
among uses.
      (1)   Residential PUDs may include any use permitted by right or as a
special use as a principal or accessory use within any Residential Zoning
Districts. A maximum of 10% of the gross site area of a residential PUD may be
devoted to commercial uses permitted by right or as a special use in the B-
1 Neighborhood Business District, including the required parking and any other
accessory uses.
      (2)   Commercial PUDs may include any use permitted by right or as a
special use as a principal or accessory use within any Business or Professional
Zoning Districts.
      (3)   Industrial PUDs may include any use permitted by right or as a
special use as a principal or accessory use in the Industrial Zoning Districts.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)
§ 150.121 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Default Standards. The use, bulk, development and improvement
standards for each planned unit development shall be derived from the
underlying zoning district. In the context of the planned unit development
those standards shall be referred to as default standards. The PUD shall be
consistent with the underlying zone upon which the PUD is based. Deviations
from any of the default standards may be approved only as provided in this
subchapter and shall be explicitly stated in the Ordinance approving the PUD.
   (B)   Density. Dwelling unit densities in a planned unit development shall
not exceed the maximum densities as designated in the Comprehensive Plan.
However, increases in dwelling unit densities above the densities allowed by
the underlying zoning district may be allowed according to the following
criteria:
      (1)   Incorporation of common open space, an increase of up to 10%.
      (2)   Preservation of natural features or utilization of existing natural
features in a harmonious fashion within the design of the site, an increase of
up to 5%.
      (3)   Removal of deteriorating structures occupying 15% or more of the
development site, an increase of up to 5%.
      (4)   Donation of land for schools or other public facilities, an
increase of up to 10%.
   (C)   Lot Coverage. The maximum lot coverage over the entire PUD site shall
be no more than 15% above the maximum lot coverage of the underlying zoning
district.
   (D)   Yards and Setbacks. The required setbacks along the periphery of the
PUD site shall be at least equal in width or depth to the minimum requirements
of the underlying zoning district unless the applicant can demonstrate that a
reduction of setbacks is necessary for protection of natural resources, and the
reduced setbacks will be offset by additional screening or common open space.
   (E)   Common Open Space. The amount and location of common open space
provided shall be consistent with the declared function of the common open
space as set forth in the application for a planned unit development. There
shall be such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of the common open
space to reasonably ensure its continuity and conservation. This assurance
shall be attained through the formation of a homeowner's association for the
area involved in the planned unit development, or by such other provisions as
may be required by the Commission.
   (F)   Off-street Parking. In no instance shall the off-street parking
requirements be less than that provided for in §§
150.060 through
150.074 of this chapter.
      (1)   Parking for Residential PUDs shall be not less than one space for
each efficiency dwelling unit, one and one-half spaces for each one bedroom
unit, and two spaces for each two or more bedroom unit.
      (2)   Parking for Commercial PUDs shall be not less than four and one-
half parking spaces per 1,000 square feet, or fraction thereof, of gross
leaseable floor area in all buildings and structures.
   (G)   Landscaping. A minimum of 2% of all off-street parking areas shall be
designated and improved as landscaped areas. Landscaped areas shall be
adequately protected from vehicular traffic and properly maintained.
   (H)   Screening. In addition to the landscaping requirements, a fence that
is a minimum of five-foot high and keeps with the general architectural design
of the development or a densely planted hedge shall be provided along any side
or rear yard abutting a residentially zoned district.
   (I)   Signage. Signs for commercial uses in a Residential PUD with
underlying residential zoning shall comply with the sign regulations for the B-
1 Zoning District. All other signs and sign structures must comply with the
regulations for the underlying zoning district.
   (J)   Sewers. All PUDs shall be connected to the public sanitary sewer
system prior to occupancy and refuse removal shall be provided to the entire
development.
   (K)   Conformity with Subdivision Standards. The provisions of the City of
Danville Subdivision Regulations, as amended, shall be adhered to, unless a
variance is granted by the Commission in accordance with the provisions
therein.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)

   (H)   The City Council, within a period of 60 days after receipt of the
Commission's recommendation, shall approve, approve with modifications or
disapprove the PUD and the preliminary development plan. In the case of
approval or approval with modifications, the City Council shall pass an
ordinance granting the PUD classification.
   (I)   Approval of the preliminary development plan by the City Council shall
not constitute final approval of a PUD. Rather, it shall be deemed an
expression of approval of the basic provisions and concepts of the plan and act
as a guide for the preparation of the final development plan. The final

Approval of the preliminary development plan shall not be construed as an
implied waiver of any matter. A waiver of any requirement shall be in written
form and must accompany the final development plan.
   (J)   The approval of the preliminary development plan by the City Council
shall be valid for one year from the date of approval. If a final development
plan is not filed within one year from the date of approval of the preliminary
development plan by the City Council, the approval of the preliminary
development plan shall lapse, and the PUD classification shall be void and no
longer in effect.
   (K)   After receiving approval of the PUD designation and the preliminary
development plan the applicant shall prepare a final development plan and other
supporting materials to specifically include:
      (1)   A subdivision plat in the same form and meeting all the
requirements of a semi-final subdivision plat under the Subdivision
regulations, if the subdivision of land is necessary;

unit types and lot coverage;
      (6)   Complete landscaping plan for the development;
      (7)   Detailed maintenance plan for open space and responsibilities for
all public and private improvements;
      (8)   Any other plans or specifications that may be necessary for final
engineering approval of drainage, street design, utilities, and other
facilities by the City Engineer;
      (9)   Certificates, seals, and signatures required for the dedication of
lands, and recording of the documents;
      (10)   The other materials required for the preliminary development plan
submission in there final form;
      (11)   Declaration of covenants, easements and restrictions affecting any

by the Commission.
   (M)   Following the review of the final development plan, the Commission
shall recommend approval, modification or disapproval of the final development
plan for the PUD within 30 days.
   (N)   The City Council, after receipt of the Commission's recommendation,
shall approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the final development
plan within a period of 60 days.
   (O)   The final approval of the PUD shall be effective only upon the passage
of an ordinance by the City Council and the filing of the final development
plan with the Recorder of Deeds. The recording of the final development plan
shall inform all who deal with the PUD of the terms, conditions and provisions
of the plan, which shall run with the land. A PUD shall be developed only
according to an approved and recorded final development plan.
   (P)   The final development approval may be granted in phases as approved by
the City Council. Each final development approval of a phase shall be recorded
in the same manner as the final approval of an entire PUD.
   (Q)   City Council approval of a final development plan for a PUD that
involves the subdivision of land shall also constitute semi-final plat approval
under the Subdivision regulations.
   (R)   No construction shall commence until the provisions of this section
are met, along with all other applicable City codes and ordinances.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)
§ 150.123 FINDINGS.
   (A)   As part of making a recommendation to the City Council on an
application for a Planned Unit Development and preliminary development plan,
the Commission shall make findings of fact based upon the evidence presented in
the hearing. These findings should detail the degree to which the proposed PUD
is consistent with the general review criteria for PUDs and should assist in
clarifying any conditions or restrictions recommended as a result of this
review process. The approval of a Planned Unit Development shall not be made
unless a preponderance of the evidence establishes all of the following:
      (1)   That the proposed PUD is consistent with the stated purpose of
these PUD regulations;
      (2)   That the proposed PUD meets the requirements and standards of these
PUD regulations;
      (3)   That the proposed PUD is in the public interest and is compatible
with adjacent properties and neighborhoods;
      (4)   That the proposed PUD is in conformity with the intent and spirit
of the planning objectives of the City.
   (B)   As part of making a recommendation to the City Council on a final
development plan, the Commission shall confirm whether the final development
plan complies with the requirements of this subchapter.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)
§ 150.124 CHANGES SUBSEQUENT TO APPROVAL.
   No amendments or modifications shall be made to the final development plan
after approval and recording, except as provided below.
   (A)   Minor Amendments. Changes which do not alter the basic provisions and
concepts of the final development plan shall be considered minor amendments and
may be authorized at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. Minor
amendments may include changes in the location, siting, and height of
buildings, provided these changes are necessitated by engineering limitations
or other circumstances unforeseen at the time the final development plan was
approved. No amendment to the approving ordinance shall be needed in such
cases, but a memorandum of changes shall be filed and recorded with the
Recorder of Deeds.
   (B)   Major Amendments. All other changes to the uses, common open spaces,
arrangement of lots, lot coverage, or development schedule may only be made by
following the procedures for final development plan approval as provided
herein. Any changes which are subsequently approved must be recorded as
amendments to the final development plan in accordance with the procedure
established for the recording of the initial final development plan.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)
§ 150.125 EXPIRATION AND TERMINATION.
   (A)   The applicant shall conform to the development schedule that is
approved with the final development plan. If the applicant has not complied
with the approved development schedule a new hearing shall be scheduled before
the Commission, to determine whether the approval of the final development plan
shall lapse, and the PUD classification be void and no longer in effect. At its
discretion and for good cause, the Zoning Administrator may extend up to one
additional year the period for the beginning of construction, the establishment
of an approved use, or completion of a phase of the development as indicated in
the approved development schedule.
   (B)   If the final approval of a PUD lapses under the provisions of this
section, the City Council shall pass an ordinance declaring such PUD final
development plan null and void under the terms of this section, and shall
direct the City Clerk to record said vacation ordinance.
   (C)   Once the final development plan for a PUD is recorded, if the
applicant desires to abandon and vacate such final development plan, the
applicant shall petition the City Council for the passage of an ordinance
vacating such final development plan. If such an ordinance is passed, the City
Clerk shall record such vacation ordinance with the County Recorder, with the
recording fee to be paid by the applicant. Unless such vacation is approved by
the City Council and duly recorded, no construction shall be undertaken or use
established on the property included in the PUD, except in accordance with the
approved PUD plan.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)
§ 150.126 REQUIRED DOCUMENTS AND BONDS.
   (A)   All common open space, upon mutual agreement of the applicant and the
City, shall be either conveyed to the City or conveyed to a not-for-profit
corporation or entity established for the purpose of benefiting the owners and
residents of the PUD or adjoining property owners by providing perpetual
maintenance of all lands in common within the PUD; or guaranteed by a
restrictive covenant describing the open space and its maintenance and
improvement and running with the land for the benefit of the residents of the
PUD or adjoining property owners or both.
   (B)   The construction and maintenance of all public facilities and
improvements which are a part of a PUD shall be bonded for in accordance with
the Subdivision Regulations, and approved prior to the recording of the final
development plan. Such bonding shall also be required for private drives that
provide ingress or egress for more than one structure.
SPECIAL USE PERMITS
§ 150.130 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Classification of Special Uses. To provide for the location of certain
uses with unique characteristics which may be appropriate for and compatible
within a given zoning district, but depending on how the use is designed and
operated, there is the potential that the use could be incompatible with
surrounding properties, or adversely affect the future development of the
community, a classification of special uses is established. The review
requirements and standards outlined in this subchapter are designed to provide
a stricter examination of such uses in order to assure compatibility within the
Zoning District and to minimize potential harmful effects of the use. Special
uses, as denoted in
Table IV-1, shall be subject to the provisions of this subchapter. Such special
uses may be developed in the zoning districts specified only if findings are
made that the standards and conditions set forth in the appropriate sections of
this subchapter are met.
   (B)   Special Use Permits. Utilizing the provisions established by this
subchapter, an applicant may file an application for a special use permit,
allowing for the establishment, operation and maintenance of a particular use,
which traditionally affects the public interest, but whose unusual nature may
give rise to unique problems for neighboring property or public facilities.
   (C)   Conformance with Other Requirements. Special uses shall conform to all
the applicable requirements governing bulk, off-street parking and loading and
all other applicable provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)
§ 150.131 APPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   An application for a special use permit shall be made in accordance with the
following procedures.

market area, traffic volumes, and timetable for development (if applicable);
      (2)   A written joinder agreement signed by the title holder of the
property and notarized, concurring with the special use request (if the
applicant is not the owner of the property).
   (C)   The applicant or his agent shall file the completed application form,
and the required site plan and exhibits, with the Zoning Administrator at least
20 days prior to the required public hearing, and shall pay a filing fee
according to the fee schedule in this chapter. The Zoning Administrator shall
schedule the application for a public hearing before the Commission.
   (D)   The applicant shall have notice of the public hearing published in a
local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days but not more than 30
days prior to the public hearing.
   (E)   Notices of the public hearing shall be mailed to all property owners
within 250 feet of the outer boundaries of the property in question. Said
mailing shall be completed at least 15 days but not more than 30 days prior to
the public hearing. The failure of any property owner to receive such
notification shall not invalidate the proceedings.
   (F)   If all required site plans and exhibits are provided, the Commission
shall hold the public hearing and shall study the application to determine
possible adverse effects of the proposed special use and to determine what
additional requirements may be necessary to reduce such adverse effects. If all
required plans and exhibits are not available for the Commission's
consideration, action on the application may be delayed until the information
is made available.
   (G)   In reviewing the special use permit application and the other evidence
presented, the Commission shall consider the following criteria. Any request
for a special use permit shall be reviewed for consistency with the following
criteria:
      (1)   The use is in substantial harmony with the purpose and intent of
the Zoning District in which it is to be located.
      (2)   The use conforms to all applicable regulations of the Zoning
District in which it is to be located.
      (3)   The use is necessary for the public convenience at the location.
      (4)   The use is consistent with applicable provisions of the
Comprehensive Plan.
      (5)   The use is compatible with the existing or allowable uses of
adjacent properties.
      (6)   The use will preserve the essential character of the neighborhood
in which it is located.
      (7)   The use will not adversely affect the public health, safety or
welfare.
      (8)   The use will not adversely influence living conditions in the
immediate vicinity.
      (9)   The use will not adversely affect adjacent properties.
      (10)   The use will not create undue traffic congestion.
      (11)   The request conforms to all applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (H)   The Commission shall prepare and adopt findings and make a
recommendation on the application in accordance with §
150.132 of this chapter.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)
§ 150.132 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.
   (A)    Findings of Fact. Before making a recommendation to the City Council
on an application for a special use permit, the Commission shall make findings
of fact based upon the evidence presented in the hearing. These findings should
detail the degree to which the proposed special use is consistent with the
review criteria and should assist in clarifying any conditions or restrictions
recommended as a result of this review process. The approval of a special use
permit shall not be made unless the evidence presented is such to establish all
of the following:
      (1)   That the proposed use is designed, located, and proposed to be
operated so that it will not be unreasonably injurious to the district in which
it shall be located or otherwise detrimental to the public health, safety or
general welfare.
      (2)   That the proposed use substantially complies with the specific
requirements of, and preserves the essential character of the Zoning District
in which it shall be located.
      (3)   That the proposed use is reasonably necessary for the public
convenience at the location in question.
   (B)   Conditions. In granting approval for any special use permit, the
Commission may recommend and the City Council may impose additional conditions
as are deemed appropriate or necessary for the reasonable protection of the
public health, safety, and welfare and to carry out the purposes of this
chapter including but not limited to the following:
      (1)   Regulate the location, extent, and intensity of such uses.
      (2)   Require adherence to an approved site plan.
      (3)   Require additional landscaping and the screening of such uses by
means of fences, walls, or vegetation.
      (4)   Stipulate required minimum lot sizes, minimum yards, and maximum
height of buildings and structures.
      (5)   Regulate vehicular access and volume, and the design and location
of parking and loading areas and structures.
      (6)   Require conformance to health, safety, and sanitation requirements,
as necessary.
      (7)   Regulate signs, architectural features, and outdoor lighting.
      (8)   Any other conditions deemed necessary to effect the purposes of
this chapter.
   (C)   Commission Recommendation. Based upon the findings, the Commission
shall make a recommendation on the special use permit application and shall
forward its findings and recommendation to the City Council. The Commission
shall recommend to the City Council one of the following three actions:
approval, conditional approval, or denial. The Commission's recommendation
shall be made within 20 days of the hearing. A tie vote by the Commission shall
be considered a recommendation to deny the special use permit request.
   Upon receipt of written objections to the proposed special use from more
than 50% of the property owners within 250 feet of the subject property, a
favorable vote of two thirds of those commissioners present shall be required
to forward a recommendation of approval of the special use permit.

show the Zoning Administrator that progress is being made towards establishing
an approved special use, then the Zoning Administrator has the discretion to
grant in writing one time extension for a reasonable period under the
circumstances.
   (B)   Revocation. Violation of the conditions of a special use permit shall
be deemed a violation of this chapter and shall be grounds for revocation of a
special use permit.
      (1)   In the event of a violation of the special use permit or any
condition thereof, the Zoning Administrator will notify the property owner of
the violation in writing. If the violation specified in such notice is not
corrected within 30 days after the notice is issued, then the Zoning
Administrator shall cause a citation for such violation to be issued and served
on the property owner at the location for which the permit was granted and the
penalty provisions of this chapter shall apply; provided, however, that, if in
the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, the violation cannot be corrected or
the property owner has refused to correct the violation and the Zoning
Administrator is satisfied that such violation will not be corrected under the
circumstances, then the Zoning Administrator may elect to commence revocation
proceedings.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator commences revocation proceedings by filing
a complaint with the Commission, alleging the facts and circumstances of the
violation of the special use permit or any condition and requesting that the
permit be revoked. Within ten days after filing such complaint, the Zoning
Administrator shall cause a copy thereof to be served on the property owner,
who shall have a period of 20 days after such service to file with the
Commission a response to the allegations of the complaint. Any allegation which
is not denied is deemed admitted. The Commission shall set the matter for
public hearing at its next regular meeting after the response is filed or the
time for filing the response has elapsed without a response being filed. At the
hearing, the Commission shall determine whether the complaint has been proven
by a preponderance of the evidence, and, if so, the Commission shall recommend
the revocation of the special use permit. The property owner shall have the
right to cross-examine witnesses and present evidence at the hearing.
      (3)   If the Commission recommends the revocation of the special use
permit, the City Council shall approve or reject such recommendation at a
regular meeting occurring within 30 days of the decision of the Commission.
      (4)   In the event the City Council approves the revocation of the

consecutive months, regardless of any intent to resume operations, the
nonconforming use shall be presumed to be abandoned and the rights provided by
this subchapter shall be forfeited and any subsequent use of the premises shall
be in compliance with the requirements applicable to the zoning district in
which the use is located.
(Ord. 8612, passed 12-2-08)
§ 150.155 DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION.
   (A)   If a nonconforming building or structure or building containing a
nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of 50%
or more of its fair market value, based on the valuation of the township
assessor, then it shall not thereafter be reconstructed or repaired unless in
full compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   In the event the damage or destruction is less than 50% of its fair
market value, the building or structure may then be restored to its preceding
condition and the occupancy and use of the building or structure which existed
at the time of the damage may be continued, provided that the restoration is
completed within 12 months of the date of damage or destruction.

Council may file in writing with the City Clerk an appeal for a stay of the
decision. Upon receipt of such an appeal the City Clerk shall forward a notice
of such appeal to the applicant and the Chairman of the Commission. The

§ 150.163 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Findings of Fact. Before making a determination on an application for
variation, the decision maker shall develop findings of fact based upon the
evidence presented in the hearing. These findings should detail the degree to
which the applicant has established that the variation is necessary and should
assist in clarifying any conditions or restrictions recommended as a result of
this review process. The approval of a variation shall not be made unless the
evidence presented is such to establish all of the following:
      (1)   That there are special circumstances or practical difficulties that
exist that have created an undue hardship that is applicable only to the
property involved.
      (2)   That the undue hardship was not created by the action or inaction
of the applicant, owner of the property or any previous property owner.
      (3)   That the applicant cannot derive a reasonable use of the property
without the variance.
      (4)   That the literal interpretations of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same zoning district.
      (5)   That the proposed variance represents the minimum necessary to make
possible the reasonable use of the lot or structures.
   (B)   Final Determination. Once the findings are made the decision maker
shall then make a final determination on the variance application. The decision
maker shall make one of the following determinations: approval, conditional
approval, or denial. The Zoning Administrator shall immediately notify the
applicant of the decision and the findings and final determination shall be
filed in the office of the Zoning Administrator.

§ 150.173 FINDINGS AND DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Findings of Fact. Before making a recommendation to the City Council
on an amendment petition, the Commission shall first make findings of fact
based upon the evidence presented in the hearing. These findings should detail
the degree to which the proposed amendment is consistent with the review

      (2)   That the proposed amendment is consistent with the spirit, purpose
and intent of this chapter.
      (3)   That the development allowed by the proposed amendment will be

findings and recommendation to the City Council. The Commission shall recommend
to the City Council one of the following three actions: approval, conditional

approve the request, it shall do so by adopting the proposed amendment by
ordinance. If the Commission voted to deny an amendment request, a two thirds
(2/3rds) affirmative vote of the City Council then holding office is required
to override the Commission's action and approve the request. If an amendment
request is contrary to the Future Land Use Map of the Comprehensive Plan, a two
thirds (2/3rds) affirmative vote of the City Council then holding office is
required to approve the request.
   (D)   Written Protests. In case of a written protest against any proposed
amendment of the regulations or districts, signed and acknowledged by either
(1) the owners of 20% of the frontage proposed to be altered, (2) the owners of

the owners of 20% of the frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be
altered, is filed with the City Clerk on or before the date of the public
hearing set forth in the notice of hearing so published, the amendment shall
not be passed except by an affirmative vote of two thirds (2/3rds) of the City
Council then holding office. In such cases, a copy of the written protest shall
be served by the protestor(s) on the petitioner for the proposed amendment and
a copy upon the attorney, if any, for the petitioner, by certified mail at the
address of such petitioner and attorney as shown in the petition for the
proposed amendment.
   (E)   Withdrawal. A petition may be withdrawn any time prior to the
beginning of the public hearing without penalty. If the petition is withdrawn
between the time the hearing begins and the City Council takes final action,
said petition cannot be reheard for 12 months.
   (F)   Denial. If a petition is considered and ultimately denied by the City
Council, that request shall not be reconsidered by the Commission or the City
Council at any time in a substantially similar form unless the Zoning
Administrator determines that conditions affecting the requested amendment have
changed significantly enough to justify reconsideration of said request.
   (G)   Re-submittal. Resubmitting another petition for an amendment after
denial or withdrawal shall be accomplished in the same general manner as is
prescribed in this subchapter.
§ 150.174 ANNEXATION AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   If a proposed annexation agreement prescribes any zoning
classification change for the property to be annexed, which would represent an
amendment to the Official Zoning Map, the Commission shall conduct a public
hearing concerning the proposed agreement according to the procedures outlined
in §

compatibility with adjacent development prior to construction, a site plan
review procedure is hereby established. Projects that involve the construction
of a new building or structure or an addition to an existing building or

required in order to ensure compliance with any other provisions of this
chapter at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator. When a site plan review

with the regulations of §§
150.150 through
150.155;
      (2)   That the proposed building or structure complies with the
applicable height, area, yard, parking and landscaping regulations as required

otherwise required by this chapter or other City codes.

LIENS.
   (A)   If the appropriate Code Official of the city determines, upon due
investigation, that any building or structure therein fails to conform to the
minimum standards of health and safety as set forth in the applicable
ordinances of the city and the owner or owners of such building or structure
fails, after due notice, to cause such property to conform, the city may make
application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring compliance with
such ordinances or for such other order as the court may deem necessary or
appropriate to secure compliance.
   (B)   If the appropriate Code Official of the city determines, upon due
investigation, that any building or structure located within the area affected
by a conservation plan adopted by the city pursuant to the Urban Community
Conservation Act, approved July 13, 1953, as heretofore and hereafter amended,
fails to conform to the standards and provisions of the plan and the owner or
owners of such building or structure fails, after due notice, to cause such
property to conform, the city has the power to make application to the circuit
court for an injunction requiring compliance with the plan or for such other
order as the court may deem necessary or appropriate to secure compliance.
   (C)   (1)   If the court orders the appointment of a receiver to cause the
building or structure to conform, the receiver may use the rents and issues of
the property toward repair and rehabilitation of the property prior to and
despite any assignment of rents. The court may further authorize the receiver
to recover the cost of repair and rehabilitation by the issuance and sale of
the notes or receiver's certificates bearing such interest as the court may
fix. The notes or certificates, after their initial issuance and transfer by
the receiver, shall be freely transferable. When sold or transferred by the
receiver in return for a valuable consideration in money, material, labor or
services, the notes or certificates shall be a first lien upon the real estate
and the rents and issues thereof and shall be superior to all prior assignments
of rents and all prior existing liens and encumbrances, except taxes. However,
within 180 days of the sale or transfer of the note or certificate, the holder
thereof shall file with the county recorder of deeds notice of the lien.
      (2)   The notice of the lien filed shall set forth:
         (a)   A description of the real estate affected sufficient for
identification;
         (b)   The face amount of the receiver's note or certificate, together

transferred for value by the receiver.
      (3)   Upon payment to the holder of the receiver's note or certificate of
the face amount thereof together with any interest thereon to such date of
payment, and upon the filing of record of a sworn statement of such payment,
the lien of the certificate shall be released. The lien may be enforced by
proceedings to foreclose as in the case of mortgages or mechanics' liens. The
suit to foreclose the lien shall be commenced within two years after the date
of default.
   (D)   In any proceedings hereunder in which the court orders the appointment
of a receiver, the court may further authorize the receiver to enter into such
agreements and to do such acts as may be required to obtain first mortgage
insurance from an agency of the federal government on the receiver's notes or
certificates.

   The electrical inspector, under the direction of the director of the
Department or his assignee, is authorized to inspect or cause to be inspected
or reinspected all work in or on any building in the city prior to or on
completion of such work, and to require that all such work is performed in the
manner herein specified. When such work is found to be faulty, defective, or in
any other manner unsafe to life or property, he shall have authority to require
the person doing such work, or owning, operating, or using the work, to place
the same in safe and secure condition, and in compliance with the provisions
herein contained. The Department shall also have the authority upon inspection
or reinspection to condemn all work that may be unsafe or hazardous to life or
property. On condemnation of such work he shall serve notice upon the person
owning, using, or installing the work to place the same in a secure and safe
condition and in compliance with the provisions herein contained. The
electrical inspector shall decide all questions not otherwise provided for in
this chapter pertaining to the installations of electrical apparatus, wire,
fixtures, devices, appliances, and attachments. The Department shall have the
power and authority to make such rules and regulations of a practical and
technical nature as herein provided, as may be necessary and desirable to make
all electrical installations and work of the maximum degree of safety to life
and property. It shall be the duty of the electrical inspector to keep, or
cause to be kept, a full, concise, definite, and complete record of his
Department's business as related to this chapter. The inspector shall not
engage in electrical work for hire within the city, or engage in other
activities that represent a conflict of interest with his duties. The inspector
may be required to perform minor routine maintenance electrical work for the
city as part of his job description.
(Ord. 9181, passed 12-4-18)
§ 153.05 LICENSING AND REGISTRATION OF ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS.
   (A)   Any person or business desiring to engage in the business (full or
part-time) of installing or altering electrical equipment in the city shall
first be licensed and registered in accordance with the requirements of this
Chapter, and
Chapter 165. This license and registration shall be known as a Class "A"
license and registration.
   (B)   Applicants not holding a valid current license shall be required to
take and pass a written test offered and administered by a private entity in
cooperation with the International Code Council. This procedure shall not apply
to applicants seeking annual renewal of an existing license. If an applicant
desires to pursue receipt of a license the applicant must first complete and
submit a license application on the form provided by the department. The
Electrical Inspector will then review the application and determine whether the
applicant is qualified and approved to test. If approved to test the applicant
will be provided an authorization to test through a Department approved agency.
An applicant taking and passing the test will be issued an electrical license.
Contractor registration shall then be completed in accordance with the
procedures, and on the forms, described in Chapter 165. No license shall be
issued to any applicant who has had a previous license issued by the city or
any other municipality revoked or if the applicant is subject to a current
suspension of a license issued by any other municipality.
   (C)   Contractors licensed in other cities shall be considered qualified to
work in the city without taking the test described in this section, provided
that the other city requires comparable testing prior to receipt of a license
and said city has a reciprocal agreement to accept the qualifications of
contractors licensed by this city. If the contractor's license issued by any
other municipality is suspended or revoked, he or she will not be authorized to
perform any work within the city and any license issued by the city shall be
suspended or revoked.
   (D)   Before any electrical permit to install or alter electrical work is
issued to any person entitled to secure permits under the preceding
regulations, the contractor (owner), or a person appointed or employed by him,
shall be designated as supervising electrician. The supervising electrician
shall be a journeyman electrician, not less than 23 years of age, and be able
to document at least five years apprenticeship or equivalent in the
installation, alteration, repair, and maintenance of electrical wires,
equipment, and apparatus, or an equivalent thereto. Applicants shall furnish
the names and addresses of former employers, period of time employed, and
capacity in which employed. Proof of service shall be furnished in a manner
satisfactory to the Department.
   The designated supervising electrician is generally expected to supervise
appropriately qualified electricians and to visit the work site often enough to
insure the workmanlike installation of electrical work. If, in the opinion of
the Department, a licensed contractor, for any reason fails to have their
supervising electrician perform the on-site inspections needed to insure the
protection of public health and safety, they may initiate appropriate actions
to remedy the situation. The Department's options, to be selected at their
discretion, shall include, but not be restricted to the following: designate,
without actually licensing, one of the contractors other electricians as an
acting-supervising electrician, provided the Department and Electrical
Commission, after conducting an interview, is comfortable with the candidate's
qualifications to supervise the work involved. The electrician shall generally
be considered qualified if:
      (1)   He is 23 years old and has five years of relevant experience; or
      (2) He holds a union journeyman's card.
   Electrical contractors licensed in Danville for more than three consecutive
years and having a creditable record of obtaining electrical permits and
performing work according to the Code, shall be allowed to designate a
supervising electrician without testing that individual. However, if the
designated supervising electrician becomes unavailable to perform on-site
inspections on a regular basis, as determined by the Department, the contractor
shall present another electrician for testing and designation as a supervising
electrician before any subsequent license can be renewed.
   (E)   If, in the opinion of the electrical inspector, any licensed
electrical contractor has willfully or repeatedly violated any of the
provisions of this chapter, the electrical inspector shall prefer charges
against such offending registered electrical contractor to the Commission. The
Commission shall immediately conduct an administrative hearing. The department
and the accused contractor may invite witnesses to provide testimony before the
Commission. If the contractor is found guilty by a majority vote, he shall be
deemed guilty of violating this chapter, and his license may be suspended or
revoked. In addition to any suspension, the Commission may require that the
contractor take and pass the test described in division (B) of this section.
Any unexpired registration fee shall be retained by the city as liquidated
damages. The Department shall keep a suitable record of all contractor's
licenses and enforcement activities pertaining to contractors.

IN GENERAL
§ 156.01 PURPOSE OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit the construction of a
mobile home park in zoned areas to provide a residential setting. To preserve
the residential quality of these parks, recognition is given to the changing
character of mobile homes in terms of size, design, and function. Residents in
these parks should have the same services and protection generally provided in
other residential districts. Because of their unusual characteristics, mobile
home parks present special problems and require special consideration
concerning their proper location and character in relation to adjacent land
uses and to the circumstances and conditions under which they may be permitted.
   (B)   The standards set forth here provide adequate protection for and
consideration of both the community and the mobile home dweller.

in writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or
relocation of the watercourse.
(Ord. 8808, passed 5-15-12)
§ 157.11 VARIANCES.
   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Director for a variance.
The Director shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall
submit its recommendation to the Danville City Council. The Danville City
Council may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems
necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      (7)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   The Director shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from
the requirements of the building protections standards of §
157.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic structures.
      (1)   Variances to the building protection requirements of §
157.07 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in §
157.02, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
§§
157.06 and
157.07 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
         (a)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure;
         (b)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture. Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case-by-case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter. In order to
minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance
issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-
floodproofed.
      (1)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      (2)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM).
      (3)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with §
157.07 of this chapter.
      (4)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with §
157.07 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces. Any mechanical,
electrical, or other utility equipment must be located above the base flood
elevation or floodproofed so that they are contained within a watertight,
floodproofed enclosure that is capable of resisting damage during flood
conditions in accordance with §
157.07 of this chapter.
      (5)   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to
the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters in accordance with §
157.07(B) of this chapter.
      (6)   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of §
157.06 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      (7)   Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction.
(Ord. 8808, passed 5-15-12)
§ 157.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the City of Danville or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this ordinance or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 8808, passed 5-15-12)
§ 157.13 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the City of
Danville to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including: Ordinance #6573 passed 5-23-1978, Ordinance #8501 passed 9-19-2006
and Ordinance #8805 passed 5-1-2012. However, this chapter does not repeal the
original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program.
Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance
easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 8808, passed 5-15-12)
§ 157.99 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Director may determine
that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The Director
shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation:

for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than $50 or more than $750 for each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      (4)   The City of Danville shall record a notice of violation on the
title of the property.
   (B)   (1)   The Director shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
      (2)   The Director is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (3)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the City Council. Written notice of such
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.
      (4)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City
Council shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Danville from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

      (1)   Nomination for landmark designation. Any person or persons except
members of the Commission may nominate for landmark designation any building
(s),
structure(s), site, object(s) or improvement(s) within the corporate limits of
the city, which has historic or architectural significance and which is at

application forms supplied by the Commission. In addition to other information,
the application shall identify the name and last known address of each owner of
the real estate on which the building(s), structure(s), site, object(s) or
improvement(s) sought to be designated is located. Applications for nomination
shall also list any buildings, structures, sites, objects or improvements which
share the real property on which the subject of the nomination is found, which
are to be exempted from landmark designation; (i.e. a modern garage behind an
historic home). In the absence of such listed exemptions, all buildings,
structures, sites, objects and improvements will be subject to the landmark
standards and provisions found in this chapter. Any member of the Historic
Preservation Committee who has a substantial personal or private interest in
any nomination must disclose that interest to the Board and recuse themselves
from any votes associated with that nomination. Applications for nomination
shall be filed with the Department, which shall determine whether the
information is complete.
      (2)   Notice to owner(s) and public. Within ten days after a proper
application has been filed, the Department shall mail, by certified mail
postage prepaid, to each owner identified in the application, a written notice
of the following:
         (a)   The date, time and place of the public hearing on the
nomination;
         (b)   The date, time and place of the informal conference: and
         (c)   A copy of the application for nomination. In addition, the
Commission shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation
within the city a legal notice of the date, time and place of the public
hearing.
      (3)   Informal conference. If the owner accepts or wishes to discuss the
designation, the Commission shall schedule an informal conference with the
owner(s) of the building(s), structure(s), site, object(s) or improvement(s)
sought to be designated a landmark. The informal conference shall be scheduled
at the owner’s convenience but in no case more than 14 days after the date the
notice to owner(s) has been mailed. At the conference not more than two members
of the Commission shall be present. The Commissioners shall explain to the
owner(s) the procedure involved in landmark designation, including without
limitation, the right of the owner(s) to consent to or deny such designation,
and such other aspects and ramifications of landmark designation as any of the
persons present may desire to discuss. The Commissioner(s) shall provide to the
owner(s) present copies of the consent and objection forms supplied by the
Commission. The informal conference shall not be an open meeting. If any owner
to whom notice has been mailed shall fail to appear at the informal conference,
the Historic Preservation Commission will consider this a denial of the
nomination.
      (4)   Denial of nomination. Any owner of a building(s), structure(s),
site, object(s) or improvement(s) nominated to be designated a landmark shall
have the right to deny such designation with the Commission. Such denial shall

Services and shall be not more than ten days after being made aware of the
nomination. If an owner denies the proposed designation, the Commission shall
notify the applicant not more than ten days after notification of denial.

designation, the Commission shall hold a public hearing of the merits of the
nomination. The hearing shall be held not less than 60 and not more than 90
days after the filing of the application. The nomination shall be approved only
upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Commission
present at such hearing. If the nomination is not approved the building(s),
structure(s), site, object(s) or improvement(s) in question shall not be
eligible for subsequent nomination for landmark designation for a period of
three years after the date of the public hearing.
      (6)   City Council action. If the Commission has concluded that a
nomination for landmark designation should be approved as provided in division
(C)(5) above, the findings and conclusion of the Commission shall be taken up
by the appropriate committee of the City Council for review and recommendation,
at its first regular committee meeting held not less than five days after the
determination of the Commission. The committee shall not conduct a new hearing,
but may receive written and oral comments from any persons interested in the
matter. The committee shall recommend either approval of the nomination or
denial of the nomination to the City Council. A tie vote of the committee shall
be deemed a recommendation for denial of the nomination. At its regular meeting
next following the action of the appropriate committee, the City Council shall
consider the findings of the Commission and the recommendation of the
committee, and shall act upon the nomination. The Council shall not conduct a
new hearing, but may receive written and oral comments from any persons
interested in the matter. Upon motion duly made and seconded, the Council shall

department and continue until the final Commission or Council (whichever is
applicable) decision. During this period, the building inspector for the city
shall impose a moratorium on any construction, alteration, demolition or
removal of improvements on the property proposed for landmark designation.

§ 160.05 HISTORIC DISTRICT DESIGNATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Applications for nominations of a proposed Historic District shall be
filed with the Department which will determine whether the information provided
is complete. The application shall be made to the Commission on a form provided
by the Commission. Nominations must be accompanied by a petition signed by 25%
of the owners of record within a proposed district.
   (B)   The Commission shall, after reviewing the necessary information make a
preliminary determination as to whether an area meets both of the following
criteria. The preliminary determination shall be made within 60 days of the
filing of the application for nomination of such area.
      (1)   A significant number of structures meeting any of the standards in
§
160.04(B); and
      (2)   An area of sufficient integrity to convey a sense of style and
place.
   (C)   Within ten days following a preliminary determination that a proposed
historic district meets the criteria in division (B) herein, the Commission
shall so notify by mail the owner(s) of record within the proposed area. For
this purpose the Commission shall utilize the most recent property ownership
records contained in the City's GIS. Any omissions resulting from this
notification procedure shall not be cause for rejection of any official
decision made under the provisions of this section. The notice shall be
accompanied by an owner consent form requesting the property owner(s) to
provide written approval or disapproval of the proposed designation. In the
case of an historic district, the owner(s) of record of any property in the
proposed district shall have one vote on the approval or disapproval of the
designation for each property owned in the proposed district. For purposes of
this section "property" shall be defined as a distinct parcel of real property
which is assigned a separate tax parcel number by the Vermilion County
Supervisor of Assessments. Joint or multiple owners of property shall not be
entitled to separate votes, but shall jointly receive one vote for each
property owned in the proposed district. Failure of an owner of record to
return the form with his or her approval or disapproval by the date of the
public hearing provided for herein shall be noted as such. Approval of at least

            (12)   If by the end of this three month period, the Commission has
found that without approval of the proposed work the property cannot be put to
a reasonable beneficial use or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic
return therefrom, then the Commission shall issue a Certificate of Economic

semi-final plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One copy
shall be retained by the Department and the other three copies forwarded with a
report to the Commission for their review.
      (6)   Commission action. Following review of the semi-final plat and
supporting material for conformity to these regulations and following
negotiations with the developer on changes deemed advisable and the kind and
extent of improvements to be made, the Commission shall, after reviewing the
recommendation of the Subdivision Committee, express its approval, disapproval
or approval with conditions and reasons therefore. The action of the Commission
shall be noted on three copies of the semi-final plat, referenced and attached
to any conditions determined. One copy shall be returned to the developer, one
copy forwarded with a report to the City Council and the other retained by the
Department.
      (7)   Semi-final plat approval effect. Approval of a semi-final plat by
the Commission shall not constitute approval of the subdivision or of the final
plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval to a layout submitted
on the semi-final plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat which
will subsequently be submitted for approval of the City Council and for
recording upon fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations and the
performance of any conditions of the conditional approval.
      (8)   Initiation of improvements. The Committee shall review the semi-
final plat and authorize the construction of improvements, provided appropriate
bonds, as determined by the city engineer, for the construction of the
improvements as required are submitted. If said bonds are received, the
developer may submit his application for final plat approval. Upon appropriate
inspection of any improvements installed, the Committee will authorize the
application for final plat approval.
      (9)   Construction time. The approval of the semi-final plat will become
void within one year unless the final plat is submitted for approval, or unless
an extension of time is requested in writing and granted by the Committee.
      (10)   City Council action. After approval of the semi-final plat by the
Commission and the fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations, one
tracing of the semi-final plat of the subdivision, drawn in ink on tracing
cloth or other permanent base, shall be submitted to the City Council with a
written statement of any conditions for approval.
      (11)   Council approval timing. The City Council will consider the semi-
final plat and conditions at a regularly scheduled meeting within 45 days after
action by the Commission.
   (H)   Procedures for approval of final plat.
      (1)   Relationship to semi-final plat. The final plat shall conform
substantially to the semi-final plat as approved, and if desired by the
developer, it may constitute only that portion of the approved semi-final plat
which he proposes for approval by the City Council, provided however, that such
portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations and that semi-final
plat approval has been granted by the City Council.
      (2)   Required information. The developer shall make application to the
Committee for approval of a final plat shall be as follows:
         (a)   Two copies of the final plat application;

in an amount stated by the city engineer. Copies are to be kept on file by the
Department, city engineer and the city clerk.
The Committee may request additional copies of any of the above items and other
additional information deemed necessary. Within five working days after the
date of submission, the Department shall determine if all the items as required
by §
161.04(C) have been submitted. If all the required items have not been
submitted, the Committee shall notify the developer of such omissions.
      (3)   Form. A map of the plat shall be drawn at a scale of 1 inch = 50
feet with the use of permanent lines or ink the outer dimensions of the map
shall be 24 inches x 36 inches maximum. The drawing shall be made on a
reproducible mylar. Maps of two or more sheets shall be referenced to an index
map placed on the first sheet. Additionally, the final plat shall be provided
in electronic digital format compatible with AutoCad.
      (4)   Committee's approval timing. Within 30 days after submission by the
developer of a final plat, the Committee shall, approve or disapprove it. The
Committee shall make every effort to insure that no material changes have been
made by the developer subsequent to the Commission's approval of the semi-final
plat and that all conditions or variances approved by the Commission have been
incorporated in the plat. If the Committee approves, it shall certify with the
signatures of its Chairman and Director of the Department. If it disapproves,
it shall set forth its reasons in its own records and provide the applicant
with a copy.
         (a)   Disapproval. Should the Committee determine to disapprove the
proposed final plat, written notice of such action, including reference to the
regulations or regulation violated by the plat, shall be mailed to the
developer. The action shall also be entered on the official records of the
Committee.
         (b)   Approval without committee action. In the event the Committee
shall fail to act upon the final plat within 30 days from the date of its
official filing, or within a mutually agreed upon extension, the final plat
shall be deemed to have been approved by said Committee. After approval of the
final plat by the Committee and the fulfillment of the requirements of these
regulations, one tracing of the final plat of the subdivision, drawn in ink on
tracing cloth or other permanent base, shall be submitted to the City Council
for approval. Commission action on the proposed subdivision is not required at
the final plat stage.
      (5)   City Council action. The City Council will consider the final plat
at its next regularly scheduled meeting after final action by the Committee.
The City Council may approve or disapprove the final plat.
      (6)   Recording of plat. Upon approval by the City Council, the final
plat shall be filed for recording in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of
Vermilion County, Illinois. The City Engineer shall also maintain a file of all
approved plats and supporting materials.
   (I)   Procedures for approval of planned unit developments.
      (1)   Planned unit development procedures. Relative to this chapter, the
following procedures shall apply:
         (a)   Once the Commission has approved the planned unit development
under the provisions of the city Zoning Ordinance, the Committee can begin its
review of the developer's plat.
         (b) A meeting of the Committee shall be called with a minimum of one
week notice.
         (c)   The Committee shall determine whether the proposed planned unit
development complies with all applicable provisions of the subdivision chapter.
         (d)   The Committee shall generally adhere to the procedures described
in §
161.03(G) for semi-final plat approval to review a planned unit development.
         (e)   After receiving the recommendation of the Committee, the
Commission shall approve, reject or approve with conditions the application for
the plat aspects of the planned unit development. This shall constitute semi-
final plat approval under this chapter and a building permit may be issued for
improvements at the developer's risk provided appropriate bonding has been
provided and approved according to this chapter.
         (f)   The Commission shall have the authority to approve or reject
variations from the standards of this chapter requested by the developer.
         (g)   The applicant shall then comply with applicable procedures (§
161.03(H)) of this chapter to receive final plat approval.
         (h)   Once the Committee has approved the final plat for the planned
unit development, the Commission and the City Council may proceed to approve
the final plat and the other aspects of the planned unit development.

(Ord. 8290, passed 12-17-02)
§ 161.05 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following are hereby adopted as the minimum standards of design of a
subdivision. In addition, all subdivisions shall conform to all applicable
elements of the city's land use plan including any change in these standards
which is indicated by any applicable plan elements. The arrangement, character,
width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the city's highway
system or plans for the opening, widening, or extension of any street, road or
major thoroughfare as adopted by the City Council in the public interest.
Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes any part of such thoroughfares as
approved or shown on the adopted land use plan, such part shall be dedicated to
the public for street purposes by the developer.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Interpretations. In order to promote the best possible development
and use of land, the Commission shall interpret the standards, provisions, and
specifications contained in this chapter liberally and in favor of the
community's interest. Exceptions from these standards, provisions, and
specifications may be granted when shown conclusively and to the satisfaction
of the Commission that such exceptions will bring about a more logical and
desirable result than would be obtained by strict compliance. When in doubt as
to the wisdom of granting such an exception, the Commission shall request a
decision from the full Commission.
      (2)   Land subject to inundation. Land subject to flooding according to
the Department's flood maps shall comply with the city's, or other applicable,
flood plain ordinances. The developer or his agent shall submit information
adequate to prove that lots or portions of lots are not subject to flood
hazard.
   (B)   Streets and alleys.
      (1)   Continuation of existing streets. Proposed streets shall, as nearly
as practicable, provide for the continuation, connection, or projection of
streets in surrounding areas; or may conform to a plan for one of the
municipality's neighborhoods as may have been prepared by the Department and
adopted by the City Council.
      (2)   Circulation. The street pattern shall provide ease of circulation
within the subdivision, but the local streets therein shall be so laid out that
their use by through traffic will be discouraged. New street openings shall be
generally prohibited within 600 feet of any major intersection or crossing,
such as: those formed by a railroad and a highway; two or more arterial
streets; or from the head of any major bridge, grade separation structure or
like facilities, as measured along the center line from the intersection or
from such structures.
      (3)   Topographical and cultural features. In sloping terrain, streets
shall generally run parallel to the contour of the land or preferably cross at
a slight angle therewith. The general objectives are to avoid steep street
grades, heavy concentrations of storm surface runoff, abnormal differentials in
building elevations at opposite sides of the street, and excessive grading
operations. Appropriate treatment shall be given to encourage the preservation
of existing views, wooded areas, creeks, and other attractive natural features
of the plat.
      (4)   Portion of tract. Where the plat to be submitted includes only a
part of the tract owned by the developer, the Commission shall require
topography and a sketch layout of the future street system on the unsubdivided
portion.
      (5)   Relocation to major streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains
an existing or proposed arterial street, the Commission may require marginal
access streets, or a reverse lot frontage with screen planting or masonry wall
contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, and such
other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of the proposed
industrial, commercial or residential development. Before requiring any
marginal streets or reverse frontage arrangements, the Commission shall take
into account and decide upon the physical location of the major public utility
lines as they relate to the existing and potential development along both sides
of the street.
      (6)   Frontage along railroads. Where a subdivision borders on a railroad
right-of-way, the Commission may require a street approximately parallel to the
side of such right-of-way, and at a reasonable distance therefrom, dependent on
the nature and intended use of the subdivision. Such distance shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of future grade separation
facilities and access roads or ramps thereto.
      (7)   Street intersections. The angle of intersection between minor and
major streets should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. All
other streets should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible
and no intersection of streets at angles of less than 70 degrees shall be
permitted.
      (8)   Street jogs. Street jogs shall be avoided whenever possible.
However, where permitted, the centerline offset distance between roads entering
a common right-of-way from opposite sides shall not be less than 150 feet.
         (a)   Half-streets. Half streets shall be prohibited. In case a half
street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street
shall be platted within such tract.
         (b)   Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets
shall not be permitted. Streets shall be located on the edge of or one lot
depth away from, the boundary of the tract.
         (c)   Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets are prohibited. However,
where it is necessary to provide circulation to undeveloped property adjacent
to the boundaries of the proposed subdivision, a temporary cul-de-sac with a
turnaround pavement radius of not less than 50 feet shall be provided within
the subdivision and adjacent to its limit for what would otherwise be stub-end
street. Provision will be made by the developer that when the right-of-way is
extended into the adjacent property that portion of the turnaround in excess of
the right-of-way width will revert to the adjacent property owner or owners and
curbs and gutters will be provided.
         (d)   Cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sac, designed to be permanent, shall not be
longer than 800 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a cul-de-sac
having an outside roadway diameter of at least 100 feet, and a right-of-way
line diameter of at least 120 feet.
         (e)   Alleys. Alleys in residential developments will be prohibited.
Service roadways will be required in commercial and industrial developments,
except where other provisions for suitable access and off-street loading and
unloading is assured. Alleys may be provided at the rear of all lots or tracts
intended for multiple-family building use; however, they will not be
encouraged.
         (f)   Right-of-way. In the case of the extension of an existing
adjoining right-of-way having a width less than the minimum requirements, the
Commission may approve the extension thereof at the same width.
   (C)   Dimensional standards.
      (1)   Typical street standard. The Commission and Department will
determine the required minimum dimensional standards of all rights-of-way,
pavements, sidewalks, and other public improvements but shall consider the
advice and recommendation of the city engineer in doing so. The typical street
requirements shall be as follows:
         (a)   Arterial street (urban). The right-of-way width shall be as
indicated in the comprehensive plan. As the geometrical design, pavement and
right-of-way widths may vary considerably over that of a typical local street,
the Commission and Department shall decide upon the pavement width and the
portion of the major street construction that shall be done by the developer.
In doing so, the Commission and Department shall take into account the
location, extent and character of the proposed development, the degree to which
the proposed lots or land use is to be serviced from or otherwise has access on
the major streets, the number of anticipated employees, and the extent of
vehicular traffic that may be generated by such improvements or subdivision
upon such major street or streets. The Commission and Department in determining
the amount of participation that shall be made by the developer, shall also
take into account the cost and participation involved in the trunk sewers and
possible extra cost in length of service connections, driveway aprons, etc.
         (b)   Collector street (urban). Eighty foot right-of-way, 36-foot
pavement, including curb and gutters, 5-foot sidewalks near property line. At
these dimensions parking shall be allowed on no more than one side of the
street.
         (c)   Local street (urban). Sixty-six foot right-of-way, 30-foot
pavement, including curb and gutters, five-foot sidewalks near property line.
At these dimensions parking shall be allowed on no more than one side of the
street.
         (d)   Dead-end street (cul-de-sac). Sixty-foot right-of-way, 27-foot
pavement. At these dimensions parking shall not be allowed on the street.
         (e)   Marginal access streets abutting a major street or highway.
Sixty- foot right-of-way, 24-foot pavement, plus curbs and gutters. At these
dimensions parking shall not be allowed on the street.
         (f)   Alleys. Sixteen and one half foot right-of-way and pavement with
space for utilities. Larger pavement, or right-of-way areas may be required by
the Commission, as needed.
         (g)   Crosswalks.   Ten-foot right-of-way, at least five-foot paved
walkway along centerline.
         (h)   Private lane or way. Twenty-four foot paving width. Curbs and
gutters and sidewalks are required unless waived by Commission.
      (2)   Street grades. No street grade shall be less than .5% and shall not

necessary for the proper installation of utilities. An easement between any two
lots located at the end of a cul-de-sac may be required in order to provide for
the engineering requirements of water distribution systems.
   (H)   Resubdividing and replatting. The reviewing Commission or Committee
shall, in the performance of its plat-approving function, be vigilant for
opportunities to encourage and facilitate the re-platting of prematurely and
inexpertly subdivided areas which are now in sharp contrast to current
standards of acceptability. Rehabilitation of these areas shall be implemented
through proper design considerations when adjacent un-subdivided land is
proposed for development.
   (I)   Business and industrial subdivisions. Business and industrial areas
shall be subdivided into lots of such size, shape, and arrangement as to meet

§ 162.01 TITLE; PURPOSE; INTENT; AND POLICY.
   (A)   Title. This chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the
“Stormwater Management Chapter of the City of Danville, Vermilion County,
Illinois.”
   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to diminish threats to property, public
health and safety, and welfare caused by increases in stormwater runoff from
development. Excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of properties,
erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, the threat to public health
and safety, and pollution and degradation of valuable stream and lake
resources. Increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate, as well as the
impairment of quality, are caused by development and land improvement and, as
such, this chapter regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts caused
by stormwater runoff created by such actions. This chapter is adopted to
accomplish the following objectives:
      (1)   Prevent flood and drainage hazards resulting from development;
      (2)   Protect the hydrologic, hydraulic, and other beneficial functions
of streams, lakes, wetlands, floodplains and flood-prone areas;
      (3)   Preserve stream corridors to moderate flooding and stormwater
impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and
riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic
benefits, and enhance community health;
      (4)   Prevent additional disruption of governmental services and the
economy due to flooding and drainage problems;
      (5)   Establish requirements and promote regular, planned maintenance of
stormwater management facilities.
   (C)   Policy. This chapter establishes a stormwater management policy for
the future control of stormwater runoff within the jurisdictional limits of the
city.
(Ord. 9097, passed 5-16-17)
§ 162.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “ADMINISTRATOR.” The Director of Urban Services or his or her designee.

education efforts to prevent the dumping of household chemicals into storm
drains).
   “BUFFER.” An area of predominantly deeply rooted native vegetated land
adjacent to channels, wetlands, lakes, or ponds for the purpose of stabilizing
banks and reducing contaminants, including sediments, in stormwater that flows
to such areas.

measured infiltration rate during design to approximate long-term infiltration
rates or similar design standards based on the specifications of pavement used
in the design.
      (5)   A planting plan is required for all vegetated stormwater BMPs.
Refer to division (E)(6) for further information.
      (6)   Prior to construction, a tree protection zone shall be delineated
at the dripline of the tree canopy. All trees scheduled to remain during
construction shall be marked; however, where groups of trees exist, only the
trees on the outside edge need to be marked. A 48-inch high snow fence or 48-
inch high construction fence mounted on steel posts located eight feet on
center shall be placed along the tree protection boundary. No construction,
storage of material, temporary parking, pollution of soil, or regrading shall
occur within the tree protection zone.
      (7)   Drainage easements shall be provided where the conveyance,
treatment, or storage of stormwater, either existing or proposed, is identified
on the SWM permit. Drainage easements shall be provided to contain and convey
the 100-year frequency flood.
      (8) A plan for the ongoing maintenance of all stormwater management
system components, including wetlands and buffer areas, is required prior to
plan approval. See §
162.07 for specific requirements.
   (B)   Water quality and volume control.
      (1)   The standards of this division (B) shall apply to all development
meeting the conditions for water quality and volume control, as stated in §
162.04(A).
      (2)   The development shall provide water quality treatment for runoff
from impervious areas to minimize impacts of post-development stormwater runoff
on water quality. The development shall provide volume control for runoff to
meet the requirements of division (C) below. The SWM plan shall include a
description of the water quality protection and volume control measures
incorporated into the site design. Volume control practices may be incorporated
into the water quality control practices.
      (3)   The first inch of runoff from the new impervious area and the first
0.5 inch of runoff from the redeveloped impervious area of development on the
site shall be the water quality control storage.
      (4)   Volume control practices shall provide water quality treatment of
the water quality control storage. Water quality and volume control practices
shall be designed according to the following hierarchy. Appendix A outlines
design specifications for the following control practices for water quality.
         (a)   Preservation of natural resource features of the development
site (e.g., floodplains, wetlands, prairies, and woodlands);
         (b)   Preservation of the existing natural streams, channels, and
drainageways;
         (c)   Minimizing impervious surfaces (e.g., narrowing road width,
minimizing driveway length and width, clustering homes and shared driveways)
created at the site, while maintaining compliancy with other community
ordinances (i.e., fire vehicle access, etc.);
         (d)   The use of native, deep-rooted landscaping as an alternative to
turf grass;
         (e)   The use of open vegetated channels, filter strips, and
infiltration (basins, trenches, floodplain restoration, etc.) to convey,
filter, and infiltrate stormwater runoff and minimize the usage of minor
stormwater systems. Design requirements for non-structural BMPs are found in
division (E) below;

control (stormwater wetlands, wet detention facilities, sedimentation traps,
etc.);
         (h)   Structural measures that provide only quantity control and
conveyance;
         (i)   Other methods as may be found in the Illinois Urban Manual.
      (5)   All volume reductions plus volume control practices from proposed
BMPs shall equal or exceed the required control volume (one-inch x new
impervious area).
   (C)   Site runoff controls. Site runoff control for large storms, up to the
100-year event, is essential to protect against immediate downstream impacts,
flooding, and erosion.
      (1)   General design methods and standards.
         (a)   Calculation of required storage. The volume of required
stormwater storage shall be calculated on the basis of the maximum value
achieved from the runoff of a design event less the volume of water released
through the outlet structure. The following standards shall apply to watersheds
of various sizes:
            1.    Development watershed area less than or equal to ten acres.
The Modified Rational Method shall be acceptable for development watersheds
equal to or less than ten acres in area.
               A.   In determining the volume of storage required when using
the Modified Rational Method, the release rate of the outlet structure shall be
assumed to be constant and equal to the release rate through the outlet
structure, when one-half of the storage volume is filled.
               B.   In determining the maximum allowable release rate for the
post-development event a runoff coefficient (C value) of 0.25 shall be used for
assumed land cover conditions.
               C.    Roughness coefficients most closely matching those of the
TR-55 method shall be used to determine time of concentration. When applying
Soil Conservation Service (SCS) methods an SCS Type II rainfall distribution
shall be assumed.
            2.    Development watershed area less than or equal to 2,000 acres.
The method utilized for calculation of required volume of storage shall be the
“Soil Conversation Service TR-55" methodology for development watersheds less
than or equal to 2,000 acres in area.
               A.   In determining the maximum allowable release rate for the
post-development event a curve number shall be used corresponding to the actual
soil types found on the development site provided, however, that the land cover
row crops, “SR + CR” in “Good” hydrologic conditions are assumed.
               B.   A roughness coefficient of 0.17 and a ponding adjustment
factor of 0.87 shall also be assumed in calculating the maximum allowable
release rate.
            3.    Development watershed area greater than 2,000 acres.
Developments and drainage designs for development watersheds larger than 2,000
acres shall use the Soil Conservation Service TR-20 methodology.
               A.    Other routing techniques may be used in determining
required storage volume upon the approval of the Administrator.
               B.    When applying Soil Conservation Service (SCS) methods an
SCS Type II rainfall distribution shall be assumed
      (2)   Design storm event.
         (a)   Precipitation values for all return period storms shall be
determined utilizing the Illinois State Water Bulletin 70.
            1.   A 100-year return period storm with a 24-hour duration shall
be used for detention design.
               A.    When using the Modified Rational Method the critical storm
duration (that requiring the largest detention volume) for any design event
shall be identified and used in determining storage volume.
      (3)   Release rates.
         (a)   Release rate shall be determined using one of the following
methods:
            1.   Method 1.
               A.    Release rate for 100-year, 24-hour design event shall not
exceed 0.20 cfs/acre
               B.    Release rate for the two-year, 24-hour design event shall
not exceed 0.04 cfs/acre.
            2.   Method 2.
               A.   For the 100-year precipitation, the rate shall not exceed
the rate of discharge from the development area for the five-year return
frequency precipitation event with the conditions defined in division (C)(1)(a)
above.
               B.    Effective discharge for frequent storm events. The outlet
structure maximum discharge for each of the one-year, two-year, and five-year
precipitation events shall be no greater than the rate of discharge from the
development area assuming row crop agricultural land cover with the required
assumptions described in division (A)(1) above.
         (b)   Emergency overflow. Each stormwater storage facility shall be
provided with a means of overflow during any event greater than the 100-year
design event.
         (c)   Flood elevations. The entire stormwater storage facility shall
be designed and constructed to fully protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the public. The minimum building site elevation adjacent to wet or dry basins
shall be set at a minimum of one foot above the maximum created head. The
maximum created head will include the energy head at the emergency overflow
structure.
         (d)   Off-site tributary areas.
            1.    Stormwater storage facilities shall not receive runoff from
tributary areas outside the development site unless the administrator
determines that runoff from such areas can be accommodated in the storage area
in a manner that will protect immediate downstream properties and unless
required by other state or federal regulations.
            2.   When stormwater runoff from tributary areas outside of the
development cannot reasonably be directed around the stormwater storage area,
the Administrator may allow use of staged release outlet structures, which
allow stormwater runoff from off-site areas to pass through the stormwater
storage area undetained, while simultaneously detaining and providing
controlled release for the volume of excess stormwater runoff from the site.
         (e)   Compensatory storage. Where portions of the owner’s land are
tributary to the same drain for an outlet, but which are within two or more
tributary areas to that drain, the owner may construct, upon site-specific
approval by the Administrator, compensatory stormwater detention facilities
within one tributary area which offset the lack of construction of stormwater
detention facilities in another tributary area. Such compensatory storage shall
be designed and constructed so that runoff is released into the drain to that
rate which would have occurred had stormwater detention facilities been
constructed for all the tributary areas. Any site developed using the
provisions of this division (C)(3) must also conform to Illinois Department of
Transportation (IDOT) regulations where applicable.
         (f)   Storage duration. The storage of excess stormwater runoff from a
100-year return period storm having a duration of 48 hours, released at the
allowable rate, shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 48 hours.
Storage duration may be longer due to unique site conditions upon site-specific
approval of the Administrator.

            1.   Channels shall be constructed so that they:
               A.    Will not unnecessarily interfere with any secondary use of
the storage area.
               B.    Reduce the frequency of time that storage area will be

            3.   Overflow areas must be provided to ensure that the weight of
stormwater will never exceed the structural capacity of the roof.
            4.   Any rooftop storage of excess stormwater shall be approved
only upon submission of building plans signed and sealed by a licensed

rate is to be determined in the same location and within the same soil horizon
as the bottom of the infiltration facility.
      (3)   Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase to maintain maximum
infiltration capacity. Staging of earthmoving activities and selection of
construction equipment should consider this protection.
      (4)   Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff from
disturbed areas until the entire contributory drainage area to the infiltration
BMP has achieved final stabilization.
      (5)   Roof drains and sump pumps shall be tributary to infiltration or
vegetative BMPs. Use of catchment facilities for the purpose of reuse is also
permitted.
      (6)   Infiltration practices should not be implemented in any of the
following circumstances:

schedule.
         (c)   Prior to construction, a tree protection zone shall be
delineated at the dripline of the tree canopy. All trees scheduled to remain
during construction shall be marked; however, where groups of trees exist, only
the trees on the outside edge need to be marked. A 48-inch high snow fence or
48-inch high construction fence mounted on steel posts located eight feet on
center shall be placed along the tree protection boundary. No construction,
storage of material, temporary parking, pollution of soil, or regrading shall

         (c)   Storm sewers and swales shall not connect to sanitary sewers.
         (d)   Storm sewers and swales may connect to existing drain tiles or
storm sewers only if the applicant submits a maintenance agreement, recorded
easements, and a report that indicates the existing system from the connection
to the discharge point in an open channel has adequate hydraulic capacity and
structural integrity. The recorded easement and maintenance agreement must
extend from the connection to the discharge point in an open channel. The
recorded easement and maintenance agreement must be approved by the
(Administrator) prior to issuance of a stormwater management permit.
         (e)   Field tile systems disturbed during development must be
reconnected by those responsible for their disturbance unless the approved
drainage plan includes provisions for the system. All abandoned field tiles on
the site shall be removed in their entirety.
         (f)   All storm sewers and minor swales shall be located in a public

damage to structures or property. If the drainage area is less than 20 acres,
the storm sewer pipe and inlet may be sized for the 100-year flow instead of
providing an overland flow path.
         (b)   The overland flow path shall be protected from any development,
such as fencing, landscaping, storage sheds, or other obstructions which could
impair its function by impeding flow. This protection shall be established
through a properly recorded covenant running with the land, restricting the use
of the overland flow path area.
         (c)   The overland flow path shall be placed over natural grade, not
overtop a pipe.
         (d)   Structures adjacent to an overland flow path shall have the
following lowest opening elevation for the following tributary areas:

(Ord. 9097, passed 5-16-17)
§ 162.09 VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   (A)   Fee in lieu of stormwater management requirements.
      (1)   For the purpose of this division (A), section stormwater management
can also mean water quality requirements.
      (2)   For overall sites that are under one acre and for which stormwater
management was not previously provided, a fee in lieu of stormwater management
may be allowed by the Administrator when it is demonstrated that the
requirements of this chapter are not practical.
      (3)   When it is demonstrated that waiving stormwater management
requirements will not cause harm to downstream property owners, the
Administrator will then determine to what extent, if any, a fee-in-lieu may be
applied.
      (4)   The fee in lieu of stormwater management shall be calculated as
$0.75 per a square foot of the overall site for all sites except those zoned B4
whose fee-in-lieu of stormwater management shall be calculated as $0.25 per
square foot of the overall site.
      (5)   The fee in lieu will be assessed against the development prior to
the issuance of a stormwater management permit.
      (6)   All funds generated by the fees collected pursuant to this division
(A) shall be deposited into the city’s storm sewer maintenance line items.
   (B)   Other variances and appeals.
      (1)   The Administrator upon application, and subject to the process and
standards that follow, may grant variances to the provisions of this chapter as
will not cause detriment to the public good, safety, or welfare nor be contrary
to the spirit, purpose, and intent of this chapter where, by reason of unique
and exceptional physical circumstances or condition of a particular property,
the literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in an
unreasonable hardship.
      (2)   Any person wishing to appeal, or seeking a variance in, a
determination made by the Administrator under the provisions of this chapter
may do so to the Board of Appeals by following the procedures set forth in §
164.13 of this Code of Ordinances. Failure to file said appeal within the
required time shall preclude further review. The appeal must state
specifically:

(Ord. 9097, passed 5-16-17)
§ 162.10 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   It is recognized that the degree of flood protection required by this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. However, on occasion, greater floods
than the base flood will occur and will result in greater flood heights and
flood damage. Furthermore, flood heights may be increased by other man-made or
natural causes. These provisions do not imply that land outside the floodplain
or flood-prone areas or that uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. These provisions shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Danville nor any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 9097, passed 5-16-17)
§ 162.11 SEVERABILITY.

APPENDIX A: WATER QUALITY VOLUME CONTROL PRACTICES DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
The following information is from the Department of Environmental Protection,
Bureau of Watershed Management. Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual,
Chapter 5: Non-Structural BMPs and Chapter 8: Stormwater Calculations and
Methodology. December, 2006.
PRESERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCE FEATURES OF THE DEVELOPMENT SITE
(e.g., FLOODPLAINS, WETLANDS, PRAIRIES, AND WOODLANDS)
Preserved natural resource features are not to be included in the Runoff Volume
calculation
Stormwater Management Area = (Total Area - Preserved Area)
Runoff from the Preserved Areas may be excluded from peak rate calculations for
runoff control, provided that the runoff from the Preserved Area is not
conveyed to and/or through stormwater management control structures. If
necessary, runoff from Preserved Areas should be directed around BMPs and
stormwater pipes and inlets by means of vegetated swales or low berms that
direct flow to natural drainage ways.
PRESERVATION OF THE EXISTING NATURAL STREAMS, CHANNELS, AND DRAINAGE WAYS
A volume reduction may be credited based upon the area of the natural drainage
feature that is vegetated.
Volume Reduction (ft 3) = Area x ¼" runoff
= Vegetated Area of Natural Drainage Feature (ft2) x ¼"/12
The peak rate is reduced by a longer travel time of runoff through natural
drainage features. The time of travel (Tt) after development may be considered
the same as the Tt before development for flows through natural drainage
features. When calculating flow rates:
Tt_before = Tt_after
MINIMIZING IMPERVIOUS SURFACES
Minimizing impervious surfaces is "self-crediting" in that the use of this BMP
automatically provides a reduction in impervious area and a corresponding
reduction in stormwater impacts.
THE USE OF NATURAL LANDSCAPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TURF GRASS
A volume reduction may be credited in the same manner as for preservation:
Volume Reduction (ft3) = Area x ¼" runoff
= Vegetated Area of Natural Landscaping (ft2) x ¼"/12
The peak rate for runoff will be reduced by using the reduced volume as
calculated above.
THE USE OF OPEN VEGETATED CHANNELS, FILTER STRIPS, AND INFILTRATION (BASINS,
TRENCHES, FLOODPLAIN RESTORATION, ETC.)
TO CONVEY, FILTER, AND INFILTRATE STORMWATER RUNOFF
Storage volume equals the amount of runoff the facility can hold.
PRESERVATION OF THE NATURAL INFILTRATION AND STORAGE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
SITE (E.G. DISCONNECTION OF IMPERVIOUS COVER,
ON-LOT BIORETENTION FACILITIES, ROOFTOP DETENTION, PARKING LOT DETENTION)
A volume reduction may be credited based upon the area that will be
disconnected from a storm sewer or other structural facility and drain into an
infiltrating area instead.
Volume Reduction (ft3) = Disconnected area (ft2) x ¼"/12
The peak rate for runoff will be reduced by using the reduced volume as
calculated above.
STRUCTURAL MEASURES THAT PROVIDE WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY CONTROL
(STORMWATER WETLANDS, WET DETENTION FACILITIES, SEDIMENTATION TRAPS, ETC.);
Storage volume equals the amount of runoff the facility can hold.
STRUCTURAL MEASURES THAT PROVIDE ONLY QUANTITY CONTROL AND CONVEYANCE.
Storage volume equals the amount of runoff the facility can hold.

§ 163.01 INTRODUCTION; PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to improve the livability and value of the
city’s rental housing stock and to promote revitalization of the city’s
neighborhoods. Studies have shown that rental housing, if left unregulated,
tends to generate a disproportionately higher level of code violations and code
enforcement problems that can ultimately lead to blight and crime within a
neighborhood. Identifying and inspecting rental housing and requiring
compliance with the city’s structures and property codes will help reduce
housing deterioration and blight in the city’s neighborhoods and will promote
revitalization.

so that they remain in compliance with city codes;
      (2)   Vacating the tenant(s) from one or more rental dwellings where
conditions exist within the rental dwelling that make the rental dwelling
either uninhabitable or dangerous and unsafe; and
      (3)   Vacating the tenant(s) from a rental dwelling where the owner
failed to maintain registration of the rental dwelling or where the city
revoked the certificate for that rental dwelling.
(Ord. 9467, passed 2-6-24)
§ 163.06 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP.
   (A)   Upon any change in ownership of a rental dwelling, the new owner shall
be required to apply for and obtain a new certificate within 30 days of
completing the acquisition of the rental dwelling. The new owner shall comply
with the registration requirements provided in §
163.04 of this chapter. There shall be no proration of the rental registration
fee due to a change in ownership.
   (B)   A “CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP” means a voluntary or involuntary lawful
transfer by deed, court order, court decree, will, or trust of all rights,
title and interest in and to real estate on which one or more rental dwellings
are located. The subleasing or assignment of a lease by a tenant to a subtenant
shall not constitute a change of ownership.
(Ord. 9467, passed 2-6-24)
§ 163.07 INSPECTIONS; CODE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Rental dwelling list. The city shall maintain a list of all registered
rental dwellings that includes the address of each rental dwelling, the owner’s
name, the owner’s contact information, and the local representative’s contact
information, if any.
   (B)   Rental dwelling inspections. Upon receipt of a rental registration
certificate, whether pursuant to an initial registration or renewal thereof,
the owner shall be deemed to have consented to an exterior and interior
inspection of the one or more rental dwellings noted on the certificate as
provided in this section. Such inspections shall be on the advance notice by
the code official or other city official and at a date and time that is
mutually convenient to the owner or local representative but which shall be no
sooner than ten calendar days from the date of the code official’s notification
to the owner or local representative of such inspection. The code official or
other city official shall have the authority to conduct an inspection of the
rental dwelling in the absence of the owner’s or local representative’s consent
if the tenant has granted such consent.
   (C)   Cyclical inspections. The code official shall establish a cyclical
inspection schedule for all registered rental dwellings that provides for each
rental dwelling to be subjected to an exterior and an interior inspection about
every four to five years. In no event shall a rental dwelling be inspected more
frequently than once every four years unless the city receives a complaint from
a tenant or another person regarding a possibly uninhabitable or a dangerous
and/or unsafe condition in or about one or more of the rental dwellings. The
city shall make the rental inspection schedule available to the public on the
city’s website.
   (D)   Complaints from persons other than tenants. The code official’s
receipt of a complaint from a person other than a tenant regarding the exterior
of a rental dwelling shall be grounds for the code official to undertake an
inspection of said exterior and the property on which the rental dwelling sits
so long as the code official does not enter upon the said property unless the
tenant, owner, or local representative gives consent to enter. If during such
exterior or property inspection the code official finds a condition that
reasonably leads that code official to believe that there may be a dangerous
and/or unsafe condition within the rental dwelling, the code official or other
city official may conduct an interior inspection with or without the tenant’s,
owner’s or local representative’s consent but upon at least four hours’ notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the code official or other city official
reasonably believes that the dangerous and/or unsafe condition presents a clear
and present danger to human life, health or safety, the code official or other
city official may gain entry into the dwelling unit for purposes of immediately
evacuating all individuals within that unit.
   (E)   Tenant complaints. The code official shall have the authority to
inspect the exterior and interior of any rental dwelling upon a complaint from
the tenant of the rental dwelling as provided in §

the owner or the local representative. The notice of inspection shall state a
date and time for the inspection that shall be no sooner than ten calendar days
from the date when the notice is sent to the aforesaid persons.
      (2)   If the code official is denied entry onto the rental dwelling
property or into the rental dwelling, the code official shall have the
authority to recommend that the mayor revoke the owner’s certificate for that
rental dwelling and the same shall not be restored to the owner until the code
official is permitted to undertake and complete the inspection. No tenant or
other person, except the owner or the owner’s immediate family, shall be
permitted to occupy the rental dwelling during the period when the certificate
for that rental dwelling is revoked.
      (3)   The nature and scope of each such inspection shall be limited to
the provisions in the city’s codes.
      (4)   For each rental dwelling inspected, the code official shall
determine whether the rental dwelling has any condition that renders it
uninhabitable or dangerous and/or unsafe.
      (5)   Upon completion of any inspection, the code official shall prepare
a written inspection report. The report shall include, but not necessarily be
limited to, the following:
         (a)   Address of the rental dwelling inspected;
         (b)   Owner’s name;
         (c)   Tenant’s name;
         (d)   Date of inspection;
         (e)   Description of all code violations observed or a statement that

         (f)   A code citation for each identified violation; and
         (g)   A date or dates by which each code violation found shall be
abated.
      (6)   In the event that the code official finds any code violation that
presents an immediate threat to human life, health or safety, the code official
shall have the authority to direct the owner or the local representative, if
any, to vacate the tenant(s) of that rental dwelling at the owner’s expense. If
the rental dwelling is part of a multi-family dwelling building and if the code
official reasonably believes that the aforementioned condition threatens human
life, health or safety of any occupant in one or more of the other rental
dwellings in the building, the code official shall have the authority to direct
the owner or the local representative, if any, to vacate, at the owner’s
expense, the tenant(s) of the one or more other rental dwellings directly
affected by the condition in the rental dwelling initially inspected.
      (7)   In addition to subsections (F)(1) through (6), the code official
shall have the authority to initiate a proceeding in the city’s administrative
adjudication system provided for in
Chapter 42 to abate the one or more violations noted in the code official’s
written report.
      (8)   Prior to completing any sale of a rental dwelling, the owner or the
owner’s local representative, if any, shall provide the prospective buyer with
a copy of the most recent inspection report, if any, for the rental dwelling
being sold as well as a written status report indicating whether each violation
noted in the said report has been abated. In the event that the property being
sold includes two or more rental dwellings, the owner or the owner’s local
representative shall provide the prospective buyer with a copy of the most
recent inspection report, if any, for each rental dwelling.
      (9)   Prior to completing the sale of any rental dwelling where the owner
or local representative is aware of one or more pending code violations
initiated by the code official, the owner or local representative shall provide
the buyer with a copy of any warning, citation, or summons and complaint
regarding the one or more code violations. The owner shall obtain the signature
of the buyer on a document that, in substance, provides that the buyer has been
given a copy of such warning, citation or summons and complaint involving the
one or more code violations.
      (10)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this §
163.07, the city shall retain the right to regularly and periodically conduct
inspections of the exteriors of rental dwellings and the properties on which
they are located pursuant to the city’s overall enforcement of the city’s
property maintenance code (
Chapter 167) so long as the code inspector does not enter onto the said
property in the absence of the owner’s, local representative’s or tenant’s
consent.
(Ord. 9467, passed 2-6-24)
§ 163.08 TENANT COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   A tenant may file a complaint with the city regarding a code violation
that the tenant knows or reasonably believes exists in the interior or on the
exterior of the rental dwelling that negatively impacts the habitability or
dangerousness and/or safety of the rental dwelling. The tenant may use a form
provided by the city, the city’s website, or by meeting with the code official

   (C)   The owner or local representative of a rental dwelling that is the
subject of a tenant complaint shall not in any way take any punitive or
retaliatory action against the tenant for the tenant’s submission of a
complaint to the city regarding the rental dwelling.
      (1)   Punitive action taken by an owner against a tenant after the date
the tenant submitted a complaint to the city shall be deemed prima facie
evidence that the owner retaliated against the tenant for filing their
complaint with the city.
      (2)   Nothing in subsection (B)(1) shall be deemed or construed as
prohibiting an owner from giving a tenant a lawful five-day or a ten-day notice
to vacate the rental dwelling for breach of a written lease; a lawful 30-day
notice to quit the rental dwelling pursuant to a month-to-month tenancy; or
serving the tenant with a lawful eviction summons and complaint. However, the
owner may still be subject to a penalty if it is determined that the owner took
such action in retaliation for a tenant filing a tenant complaint about the
rental dwelling with the city.
   (D)   Upon receipt of a legitimate tenant complaint, the code official shall
contact the tenant to arrange a mutually acceptable date and time when the code
official can inspect the rental dwelling and/or the property on which it is
located to ascertain the nature and severity of the one or more violations
described in the tenant’s complaint. The code official may note any one or more
additional code violations found during such inspection, regardless of whether
or not they are included in the tenant's complaint.
      (1)   Upon completion of the aforesaid inspection, the code official
shall prepare a report of the code official’s findings during the inspection.
The report shall include:
         (a)   The address of the rental dwelling;
         (b)   Whether or not any code violation was found during such
inspection;
         (c)   A reasonable description of each code violation found and its
location;

violation and a reference to each code section violated;

         (f)   A date or dates, depending on the nature of each violation, by
which the owner shall have the violation abated;
         (g)   A date when the code official shall return to the rental
dwelling for a re-inspection to determine if the one or more violations have
been abated; and
         (h)   A statement that failure to abate the one or more violations may
result in the city instituting proceedings in its administrative adjudication

dwelling.
      (2)   If, upon reinspection, the code official determines that the owner
failed to abate the one or more violations described in the code official’s
report, the code official shall commence a code violation case against the
owner for the one or more violations in the rental dwelling and/or on the
property on which that rental dwelling is located pursuant to
Chapter 42.
      (3)   If it is determined that the tenant was served with a five-day or
ten-day notice to quit the premises or a 30-day notice of termination of the
lease prior to the tenant’s filing a complaint regarding one or more conditions
at or in the tenant’s rental dwelling, the city shall dismiss the tenant
complaint and not proceed with any inspection.
   (E)   If at any time the tenant refuses to allow the code official or other
city official to inspect for the one or more conditions that are the subject of
the tenant’s complaint, the city shall dismiss the complaint and not conduct
such inspection unless the owner or the local representative consents to the
inspection.
   (F)   Owners of rental dwellings shall be responsible for all code
violations that occur on the rental dwelling property and within the rental
dwelling, regardless of whether or not the tenant caused the violation. All
disputes between the owner or local representative and tenant regarding who is
responsible for correcting the violation shall be deemed a matter to be
resolved between the owner or local representative and the tenant.

demonstrate by documentation that:
         (a)   The owner sold the one or more rental dwellings on or before
February 1;

163.05(A), at one or more rental dwellings shall subject the owner to a fine of
$750 per rental dwelling. If the owner or the local representative continues to
refuse the code official’s or other city official’s request to inspect the one
or more rental dwellings or the said fine is not paid within 21 days of when it
is levied, the mayor shall have the authority to revoke the owner’s one or more
certificates for these rental dwellings for a period no longer than 180 days or
until the said emergency condition or conditions have been abated, whichever is

      (2)   Any owner or local representative that refuses or fails on three or

code official or other city official to address a non-emergency, as provided in
§
163.05(A), at one or more rental dwellings shall subject the owner to a fine of

all the owner’s rental dwelling certificates.

official during the tenant complaint inspection before the owner served the
tenant with a five-day notice or a ten-day notice to quit the premises or a 30-
day notice that a month-to-month tenancy will be vacated, or filed in the

of this subsection, the owner can tender a $1,000 payment to the tenant on the
same day the tenant requests or demands the reimbursements and/or refunds
provided in the immediate aforesaid subsections.
         (g)   If two or more unrelated tenants lawfully occupied the same
rental unit, the amounts provided in subsections (E)(2)(a), (b), (c), and (d)

of time without the tenant having to vacate the rental dwelling and if the
owner or local representative fails to abate those violations within that
stated period of time, in addition to any other penalty imposed pursuant to
this section, an additional fine of not less than $1,000 can be imposed after

      (4)   A rental dwelling in a multi-rental dwelling building has been
condemned as uninhabitable; or because the entire building has been condemned
as uninhabitable; or because another rental dwelling in the building that has
been condemned as uninhabitable threatens the habitability of one or more other
rental dwellings within the said building.
      (5)   The owner’s application is incomplete.
      (6)   The owner has not tendered the registration or certificate renewal

third person.
   (I)   Prosecution of violations of this chapter. All violations of this
chapter shall be prosecuted through the administrative adjudication process

§ 166.04 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Failure to abate; cost of abatement; lien.
      (1)   In addition to any other penalty which may be imposed against the
responsible party, if a violation is not corrected, abated or removed upon a
plea of guilty or finding of guilt of the violation(s), the Department may
cause the correction, abatement or removal of the violation. The failure of the
responsible party to correct, abate or remove the violation(s) shall be deemed
to be an implied consent for the Department to cause the correction, abatement
or removal of the violations.
      (2)   The owner, occupant, or other responsible party shall be liable for
the costs incurred by the city in correcting, abating or removing the
violation. Said costs shall include, but not necessarily be limited to: the

description of the real estate sufficient for identification; the amount of
costs incurred by the city; and, the date or dates when such costs were
incurred. Any costs incurred by the city in preparing and filing the lien,
including filing or recording fees and reasonable attorney’s fees, shall be
added to the amount of the lien.

lien-holder of record arising prior to the filing of such notice in the office
of the Recorder of Deeds of Vermilion County, Illinois.
      (5)   The city shall add interest at a rate of 6% per annum on all liens
filed pursuant to this chapter. The city shall have the power to foreclose any
lien filed pursuant to this chapter in the same manner and with the same effect
as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate.

owner, occupant or other responsible party in a civil action to recover the
amount due the city for the costs of correction, abatement or removal, plus
reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit. The action shall be based upon
the implied consent by the owner, occupant or other responsible party to form a
contract with the city for the correction, abatement or removal of the
violation. The action authorized herein shall be in addition to and without
waiver of any other remedy. Judgment in a civil action brought by the city to

the lien. Only satisfaction of the judgment or the filing of a release and
satisfaction of lien shall release said lien.

      (1)   Fines. Any person, firm, corporation or similar entity found guilty
of a violation of any of the Codes shall, in addition to any other remedy
allowed, be fined not less than $200 nor more than $1,000 for each offense.

offense. In addition to any fine imposed hereunder, the offender shall be

which shall include but not be limited to the costs associated with an
administrative adjudication proceeding or circuit court proceeding, and
reasonable attorney’s fees.

compromise the violation and penalty prior to a hearing according to the
following:

CHAPTER 168: COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
Section
   
168.01   Comprehensive Plan adopted by reference
§ 168.01 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ADOPTED BY REFERENCE.
   (A)   The "Danville 2025" Comprehensive Plan is hereby approved and adopted
by reference. The Comprehensive Plan shall not be amended except by action of
the City Council. Copies of the Comprehensive Plan and all amendments thereto
shall be made available to the public and to any vendors and contractors who
may so request.
   (B)   Background.
      (1)   The Comprehensive Plan is the master plan for the future growth and
development of the city. The Comprehensive Plan guides planning and development
policy for the city and the one and one-half mile territory adjoining the city
limits. The Comprehensive Plan serves as a long-range vision of what we want
our city to become, as a tool for making decisions about how that vision should
be achieved, and as a specific program of action for reaching our stated
objectives. As a long-range vision, the Plan sets forth the values we want to
realize as the city changes over the next 20 years and ties those values to the
physical development and shaping of the community. It also presents an official
policy framework and mapped context for making incremental decisions regarding
land development issues. Finally, the Plan outlines the strategies and steps
the community can follow to make it a reality.
      (2)   The purpose of this Plan is to serve as an advisory guide for
making decisions on matters pertaining to the quality of life in the community
with particular emphasis on the future physical development of the city. As an
advisory guide, the plan is intended to be flexible, generalized in nature and
designed for periodic review and revision. Because the city is a dynamic
entity, the Comprehensive Plan should be updated every five to ten years to
address the changes and accomplishments taking place along the way.
      (3)   There are numerous factors that make having an adopted
Comprehensive Plan essential for the city. Most of the city's past development
occurred without the guidance of any planning and land use controls. The
Comprehensive Plan will help guide the redevelopment of some of these poorly
planned areas of the community. It is also paramount to have a Comprehensive
Plan because zoning can not lawfully be carried out without practicing long
range planning and having a land use plan. The Comprehensive Plan will also
enhance development options, improve the quality of life, and allow the city to
use scarce local resources more efficiently.
      (4)   A Comprehensive Plan does have certain inherent limitations. A
Comprehensive Plan does not represent an end result. Although the Plan
summarizes survey results, presents community goals and objectives, outlines
policies and plans for future development, and identifies needed actions, these
actions must be carried out and supplemented with continuous review and
updating in order to complete the process. Additionally, the Plan does not
attempt to thoroughly analyze every aspect of community development. The Plan
is concerned with outlining a basic course of action to encourage development
that preserves and enhances the local quality of life. Its recommendations are
generalized in regard to future land use patterns, street alignments, and urban
design. Further, in order to avoid duplication of efforts the Plan is
deliberately more generalized where more detailed target area planning is
necessary.
      (5)   This Plan has been prepared pursuant to the Illinois Municipal
Code, which grants municipal plan commissions the authority "to prepare and
recommend to the corporate authorities a comprehensive plan for the present and
future development or redevelopment of the municipality" (ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, §
11-12-5).
      (6)   This Plan may be adopted as a whole or in particular parts, and
will become effective upon the passage of ordinances by the corporate
authorities of the city. It may be amended in whole or in part from time to
time.
      (7)   The Planning and Zoning Commission is responsible for overseeing
the implementation of the Plan and will consider any necessary changes to the
Plan as applicable.

§ 169.01 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds that vacant buildings are unsightly, unsafe, a
nuisance and create a hazard for the neighborhood and citizens, and have a
negative effect on the community. Further, many buildings, once vacant, remain
that way for years. The purpose of this Chapter is to protect the public
health, safety, and welfare by establishing a program for identifying and
registering vacant buildings, to set forth the responsibilities of owners of
vacant buildings, and to speed the rehabilitation of vacant structures.
(Ord. 8613, passed 12-2-08; Am. Ord. 8765, passed 12-6-11)
§ 169.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this Chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "EMERGENCY SITUATION.” Where the condition of the building, structure, or
any part thereof is an imminent, immediate, and substantial danger to the
health or safety of anyone on the premises or the general public. Such
conditions include, but are not limited to: fire hazards; falling or
dilapidated buildings, structures, or any part thereof; or such condition
resulting from a sudden event/occurrence which causes loss of significant
water, heat, ventilation, or lack of sanitary conditions.
   "ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.” Individuals charged with enforcing the Code of
Ordinances of the City, including staff of the Public Development and Public
Safety Departments of the City.
   "OWNER.” The person, persons, or entity shown to be the owner or owners on
the records of the Vermilion County Recorder, those identified as the owner or
owners on a vacant building registration form, a mortgagee in possession, a
mortgagor in possession, assignee of rents, receiver, executor, trustee,
lessee, or other person, firm or corporation in control of the premises. Any
such person shall have joint and several obligations for compliance with the
provisions of this Chapter.
   "SECURED BY OTHER THAN NORMAL MEANS.” A building secured by means other than
those used in the design or approved plans for the building.

who have a legal right to be on the premises, including buildings ordered
vacated by an enforcement officer of the City, a court of competent
jurisdiction, or Administrative Adjudication Hearing Officer. The term shall
also mean a building which is empty or not lawfully occupied on a regular basis
for the usual and customary purposes for which the building is designed. In
determining whether a building is unoccupied, the enforcement officer may
consider these factors, among others: whether lawful residential or business
activity has ceased; the building is substantially devoid of contents or has
minimal fixtures or personal property in the building; the building lacks
utility services; the building is subject to a foreclosure action; and, the
presence or reoccurrence of violations of city codes.
   "UNSECURED.” A building or portion of a building which is open to entry by

§ 169.03 VACANT BUILDING REGISTRATION.
   (A)   The owner of a vacant building shall register with the Public
Development Department no later than 30 days after any building becomes a
“vacant building”. The obligation to register a building as a vacant building
shall be on the owner of the building. The City may give notice to an owner
requiring registration as indicated, but the obligation to register rests with
the owner whether or not the owner receives any notice. An enforcement officer
may identify vacant buildings through a routine inspection process. Upon
notification by residents, neighborhood associations or other community groups
that a building may be eligible for inclusion on the registry, an enforcement
officer shall conduct an inspection to determine whether such building is a
“vacant building” and required to be registered.
   (B)   A notice to register issued by an enforcement officer shall be served
either in person or by first class mail to the owner of record and any
registered property manager, if known. If the notice is served by first class
mail, the notice shall be sent to the owner's and manager's last known address
and the date of mailing shall be the date of service. The notice to register
may also include information outlining programs available which may be useful
to implement a rehabilitation plan.
   (C)   The registration shall be submitted on forms provided by the Public
Development Department and shall include the following information:

and all other parties with an ownership interest in the building;
      (5)   A vacant building plan as described in subsection (D) below.
   (D)   The owner shall submit a vacant building plan, which must be approved
by the Public Development Department Director or his designee. The plan shall
contain a statement as to which of the following three options for the property
the owner has chosen for the property, as well as the accompanying information.
      (1)   Building to be demolished. If the building is to be demolished, the
owner shall provide a demolition plan indicating the proposed time frame for
completion of the demolition.
      (2)   Building to remain vacant. If the building is to continue to be
vacant, the owner shall provide a plan for securing the building, along with
the procedure for maintaining the building and property. The owner shall also
provide a statement as to the reason(s) why the building will continue to be
vacant.
      (3)   Building to be rehabilitated. If the building is to be returned to
appropriate occupancy or use, the owner shall provide a plan for rehabilitating
the building. The rehabilitation plan shall provide for completion of the
rehabilitation within a reasonable period commensurate with the condition of
the building from the date of submission of the plan and will include a plan
progress review every 4 months. Any repairs, improvements, or alterations to
the property must comply with all applicable city codes, including but not
limited to, zoning, historic preservation, property maintenance code and
building codes. A plan progress review may be extended by the Public
Development Department Director, or his designee, but only for good cause shown
and upon receipt of a written statement from the owner detailing the reasons
for the requested extension.
   (E)   The owner shall comply with all applicable laws and codes in meeting
the obligations under the plan chosen. The owner shall notify the Public
Development Department of any changes in information supplied as part of the
vacant building registration within 30 days of the change. If the plan or
timetable for the vacant building is revised in any way, the revisions shall be
in writing and must meet the approval of the Public Development Department
Director or his designee.
   (F)   The owner and any subsequent owner shall keep the building secured and
safe and the building and property properly maintained, according to all
applicable codes.
   (G)   Failure of the owner or any subsequent owner to meet the obligations
of the plan or maintain the building and property as required herein or by
other City Codes shall be grounds for the City:
      (1)   To remediate or demolish the building at the owner's expense; or
      (2)   To pursue any and all violations and to impose the fees provided in
this Chapter and any applicable penalties provided in the City Code against the
Owner.
   (H)   Any new owner shall register or re-register the vacant building with
the Public Development Department within 30 days of any transfer of an
ownership interest in a vacant building. The new owner shall comply with the
approved plan and timetable submitted by the previous owner until any proposed
changes are submitted and meet the approval of the Public Development Director.
   (I)   Registration fees; Insurance.
      (1)   The owner of a vacant residential building shall pay a registration
fee of $50. The owner of a vacant non-residential building shall pay a
registration fee of $100. Any vacant building containing both residential and
non-residential areas shall be considered non-residential for purposes of the
registration fee. The registration fee is due and payable upon registration.
      (2)   The owner of a vacant building shall be required to maintain
insurance in an amount sufficient to secure the repairs or demolition of the
building. The owner shall maintain such insurance until the building is no
longer vacant or is demolished. A copy of the certificate of insurance shall be
attached to the registration form.
      (3)   If the building is to remain vacant, the owner shall also pay an
annual vacant building fee of $500 until the building is properly demolished or
rehabilitated. The $500 annual vacant building fee is due and payable together
with the registration fee and on each anniversary thereafter until the building
is demolished or rehabilitated. In the event the owner has obtained and
maintained permits for repairs to the building and is making progress on such
repairs, the $500 annual fee shall be held in abeyance. In the event that the
permits expire or the owner is not making progress as outlined in the
rehabilitation plan, the owner shall pay such $500 annual vacant building fee.
      (4)   If the building is to be returned to appropriate occupancy or use,
the rehabilitation plan shall include a plan progress review every four months.
A plan progress review may be extended by the Public Development Department
Director, or his designee, but only for good cause shown and upon receipt of a
written statement from the owner detailing the reasons for the requested
extension. If the rehabilitation has not been completed within a reasonable
time period commensurate with the condition of the building, the owner shall
pay an annual vacant building fee of $500 until the building is properly
demolished or rehabilitated. In the event the owner has obtained and maintained
permits for repairs to the building and is making progress on such repairs, the
$500 annual fee shall be held in abeyance. In the event that the permits expire
or the owner is not making progress as outlined in the rehabilitation plan, the
owner shall pay such $500 annual vacant building fee. The $500 annual vacant
building fee is payable on the anniversary of the payment of the registration
fee in (1) above, and on each anniversary thereafter until the building is
demolished or rehabilitated.
      (5)   If the owner of a vacant building fails to register, pay the fees,
and maintain the required insurance, the owner shall be subject to the
penalties set forth in this Chapter.
      (6)   All fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any transfer of an
ownership interest in any vacant building. The fees will be disclosed by the
seller to the buyer prior to the sale. If the fees are not paid prior to any
transfer, the new owner will pay the annual fee plus $300 no later than 30 days
after the transfer of ownership, and the subsequent annual fees will be due on
the new anniversary date. If the building is no longer subject to the
provisions of this Chapter within such 30-day period, the new owner will not be
required to pay the annual fee or the $300 as indicated above.
      (7)   Any owner who fails to pay an annual vacant building fee when due
shall be charged a late fee of $25 per month or any part thereof for which
payment received within 30 days from the date of the demand for payment or an
invoice.

§ 170.05 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL STANDARDS.
   (A)   The following soil erosion and sediment control-related requirements
shall be met for all regulated land disturbing activities as defined in §
170.04 of this chapter:
      (1)   All erosion control measures, construction and post construction
storm water runoff shall meet the current minimum departmental and Illinois EPA
standards and requirements at the time of installation.
      (2)   Construction site operators shall control or prohibit non-storm
water discharges from any site. This includes concrete and wastewater from
washout of concrete (unless managed by an appropriate control), drywall
compound, wastewater from washout and cleanout of stucco, paint, form release
oils, curing compounds and other construction materials, fuels, oils, or other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance, soaps,
solvents, or detergents, toxic or hazardous substances from a spill or other
release, or any other pollutant that could cause or tend to cause water
pollution.
      (3)   Erosion control measures must be in place and approved prior to all
land disturbances.
      (4)   Soil disturbance shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize
erosion. Areas of the development site that are not to be graded shall be
protected from construction traffic or other disturbance until final seeding is
performed. Soil stabilization measures shall consider the time of year, site
conditions, and the use of temporary or permanent measures.
      (5)   Properties and channels adjoining development sites shall be
protected from erosion and sedimentation. At points where concentrated flow
leaves a development site, energy dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel as necessary to
provide a non-erosive velocity of flow from the structure to the watercourse so
that the natural physical and biological characteristics and functions are
maintained and protected.
      (6)   Soil erosion and sediment control features shall be constructed
prior to the commencement of hydrologic disturbance of upland areas.
      (7)   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent
measures within 14 calendar days following the end of active hydrologic
disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria or using
an appropriate measure as approved by the Administrator.
         (a)   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or non-vegetative measures.
         (b)   Areas of embankments having slopes greater than or equal to 3H:
1V shall be stabilized with staked-in-place sod,,mat, or blanket in combination
with seeding.
         (c)   Erosion control blankets shall be required on all interior
detention basin side slopes between the normal water level and high water
level.
         (d)   The 14-day stabilization requirement may be precluded by snow
cover or where construction activity will resume within 21 days from when the
active hydrologic disturbance ceased, then stabilization measures do not have
to be initiated on that portion of the site by the fourteenth day after
construction activity temporarily ceased, given that portion of the site has
appropriate soil erosion and sediment controls.
      (8)   Land disturbance activities in streams shall be avoided, where
possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements
shall be met:
         (a)   Where stream construction crossings are necessary, temporary
crossings shall be constructed of non-erosive material.
         (b)   The time and area of disturbance of a stream shall be kept to a
minimum. The stream, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized within 48
hours after channel disturbance is completed or interrupted.
         (c)   Any applicable federal and state permits that have been approved
shall be provided to the Administrator.
      (9)   Soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be appropriate
with regard to the amount of tributary drainage area as follows:
         (a)   Disturbed areas draining less than one acre shall, at a minimum,
be protected by a filter barrier (including filter fences, which at a minimum,
meet the applicable sections of the AASHTO Standard Specification 288-00, or
equivalent control measures) to control all off-site runoff. Vegetated filter
strips, with a minimum width of 25-feet, in the direction of flow, may be used
as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected.
         (b)   Disturbed areas draining more than one but fewer than five acres
shall, at a minimum, be protected by a sediment trap or equivalent control
measure at a point downslope of the disturbed area.
         (c)   Disturbed areas draining five acres or more, shall, at a
minimum, be protected by a sediment basin with a perforated filtered riser pipe
or equivalent control measures at a point downslope of the disturbed area.
         (d)   Sediment basins shall have both a permanent pool (dead storage)
and additional volume (live storage) with each volume equal to the runoff
amount of a two-year, 24-hour event over the onsite hydrologically disturbed
tributary drainage area to the sediment basin. The available sediment volume
below normal water level, in addition to the dead storage volume shall be sized
to store the estimated sediment load generated from the site over the duration
of the construction period. For construction periods exceeding one year, the
one-year sediment load and a sediment removal schedule may be submitted. If the
detention basin for the proposed development condition of the site is used for
the sediment basin, the above volume requirements will be explicitly met. Until
the site is finally stabilized, the basin permanent pool of water shall meet
the above volume requirements and have a filtered perforated riser protecting
the outflow pipe.
         (e)   To calculate the sediment load, applicants can use FLOWSED as
developed by the USEPA and other design guidelines by USEPA.
      (10)   All storm sewers that are or will be functioning during
construction shall be protected by an appropriate sediment control measure and
cleaned at any point during construction as needed and once the site has been
stabilized.
      (11)   If dewatering services are used, adjoining properties and
discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. Discharges shall be routed
through an effective sediment control measure (e.g., sediment trap, sediment
basin, or other appropriate measures).
      (12)   All temporary soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soil areas, including areas disturbed while removing temporary measures, shall
be permanently stabilized.
      (13)   A stabilized construction entrance, consisting of a stabilized mat
of sufficiently sized aggregate underlain with filter cloth (or other
appropriate measures) shall be located at any point where traffic will be
entering or leaving a construction site of a major development to or from a
public right-of-way, street, alley, or parking area. Any sediment or soil
reaching an improved public right-of-way, street, alley, or parking area shall
be removed by scraping or street cleaning. Sediment or soil shall at a minimum,
be removed daily and more frequently as accumulations warrant. Removed sediment
or soil shall be transported to a controlled sediment disposal area. The
Administrator may require additional stabilized construction entrance methods.
      (14)   Earthen embankments shall be constructed with side slopes no
steeper than 3H:1V. Steeper slopes may be constructed with appropriate
stabilization as approved by the Administrator.
      (15)   Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and
diversions, and the outlet of all channels and pipes shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the ten-year frequency
storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized
within 48 hours.
      (16)   Temporary diversions shall be constructed, as necessary, to direct
all runoff from hydrologically disturbed areas to the appropriate sediment trap
or basin.
      (17)   Soil stockpiles shall not be located in a flood-prone area or a
designated buffer protecting Waters of the United States. Soil stockpiles are
defined as having greater than 50 cubic yards of soil and will remain in place
for more than seven days. Soil stockpile locations shall be shown on the soil
erosion and sediment control plan and shall have the appropriate measures to
prevent erosion of the stockpile.
      (18)   Handbooks: Standards and specifications contained in the Illinois
Urban Manual, as amended, and the planning procedures sections of the Illinois
Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control, as
amended, are referenced in this ordinance as guidance for presenting soil
erosion and sediment control plan specifications and delineating procedures and
methods of operation under site development for soil erosion and sediment
control. In the event of conflict between provisions of said manuals and this
chapter, this chapter shall govern.
      (19)   The applicant shall provide adequate receptacles for the
deposition of all construction material debris generated during the development
process. The applicant shall not cause or permit the dumping, depositing,
dropping, throwing, discarding, or leaving of construction material debris upon
or into any development site, channel, or Waters of the U.S. The applicant
shall maintain the development site free of construction material debris.
      (20)   All regulated construction sites shall have a SWPPP that meets the
requirements of Part IV of NPDES Permit No. ILR10.

   To facilitate inspections by the Administrator and to ensure compliance with
the approved erosion and sediment control plan, the grading or building permit,
and this chapter, the permittee shall notify the Administrator within one to
three working days of the completion of the construction stages specified
below:
   (A)   For Class 1 land disturbance permits:
      (1)   Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control
(controls and diversions), prior to proceeding with any other earth disturbance
or grading;
      (2)   After stripping and clearing;
      (3)   After rough grading;
      (4)   After final grading;
      (5)   After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and
      (6)   After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of
sediment controls.
   (B)   For Class 2 land disturbance permits only items (1), (3), and (6) in
the above division (A) shall apply.
   (C)   If stripping, clearing, grading, and/or landscaping are to be done in
phases or separate areas, the permittee shall give notice at the completion of
each of the above work stages in each phase or area.
   (D)   Special precautions.
      (1)   If at any stage of the grading of any development site the
Administrator determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such that
further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any
property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the
Administrator may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that
such reasonable special precautions be taken as is considered advisable to
avoid the likelihood of such peril. “Special precautions” may include, but
shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control, and
      (2)   Recommendations of a soil scientist and/or engineering geologist,
which may outline requirements for further work.
      (3)   Where it appears that storm damage may occur due to incomplete
grading at the site, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect
adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments or where unusual
site conditions prevail, the Administrator may specify the start and end dates
for grading operations or may require that the operations be conducted in
specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices
prior to the advent of seasonal rains.

pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.

from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the city
improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless
provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless provider has no
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as
may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the city or its employees or
agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have
against the city with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability.
(Ord. 9161, passed 7-17-18)

and expense, the following insurance:

risks;
      (2)   Workers’ compensation insurance, as required by law; or

property damage.
   (B)   The wireless provider shall include the city as an additional insured
on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and
documentation of inclusion of the city in a commercial general liability policy
prior to the collocation of any wireless facility. A wireless provider may
self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirement
required by the City. A wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to
the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name
of additional insureds under this Section. A wireless provider that elects to
self-insure shall provide to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the

provision or invalid application of this chapter is severable.
