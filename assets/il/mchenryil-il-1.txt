1-4B-9: DEFENSES TO BUILDING CODE VIOLATION:
Except for violations of title 10, chapter 8, “Property Maintenance Code”, of
this Code, as amended, it shall be a defense to a Building Code violation
charged if the owner, their attorney or any other agent or representative

(Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019)
   A.   Current Occupants Continuing Violation: The Building Code violation has
been caused by the current property occupants and, in spite of reasonable

The order to correct a Building Code violation and the sanction imposed by the
City as the result of a finding of a Building Code violation under this

so that a finding of a Building Code violation against one owner cannot be
avoided by conveying or transferring the property to another owner. Any
subsequent transferee or owner of the subject structure or property shall be
subject to the findings, decision and order of a Hearing Officer. (1987 Code §
2.25-10)
1-4B-11: SUBPOENAS:

request to an Administrative Law Judge for a subpoena must be timely. Service
of subpoenas shall be made in the same manner as summons in a civil action.
Issuance shall be based upon whether the evidence sought is relevant and
necessary to the defense of a violation, where without the issuance of the
subpoena, the defense could not otherwise be established by the requesting
party.
   B.   Content: A subpoena issued under this article shall identify:
      1.   The person to whom it is directed;
      2.   The documents or other items sought by the subpoena, if any; and

filing a written motion with the Office of Administrative Adjudication, and
with proper notice to all parties. The motion shall specify the grounds
therefor, and shall be heard by an Administrative Law Judge on the return date
indicated on the subpoena, or at the next hearing date scheduled for the case,
whichever occurs earlier.
(1987 Code § 2.25-11)
1-4B-12: DEFAULT; MOTION TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT:
   A.   Default: The Administrative Law Judge may find a respondent in default
if the respondent, their attorney or authorized representative fails to appear
at a hearing where proper service of notice of the hearing has been provided to
the respondent, in accordance with this article, and where there is not a
finding of good cause by the Administrative Law Judge for the respondent’s
absence. Upon a finding of default, the hearing shall then proceed in absence
of the respondent and evidence may be accepted relevant to the Code violation.
A copy of the findings, decision and order resulting from the hearing shall be
served on the respondent within five (5) days after it is issued.
(Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019)
   B.   Motion To Set Aside Default Judgment: The Administrative Law Judge may
set aside any judgment entered by default and set a new hearing date, upon a
petition filed by the respondent within twenty one (21) days after the issuance
of the order of default, if the Administrative Law Judge determines that the
respondent’s failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause, or at any
time if the respondent establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the City did not provide proper service of process. If any judgment is set
aside pursuant to this section, the Administrative Law Judge shall have
authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been recorded for
any debt due and owing the City as a result of the vacated default judgment.
When a judgment is vacated, the Administrative Law Judge shall proceed
immediately with a new hearing on the underlying violation(s) as soon as
practical.
(1987 Code § 2.25-12)
1-4B-13: JUDICIAL REVIEW:
Any final decision by an Administrative Law Judge that a Code violation does or
does not exist shall constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial
review and shall be subject to review under the Illinois Administrative Review
Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.)
(1987 Code § 2.25-13)
1-4B-14: ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT:
Any fine, other sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other sanction,
or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the failure to
exhaust judicial review procedures under the Illinois Administrative Review Law
are a debt due and owing the City and may be collected in accordance with
applicable law. Additionally, after expiration of the period in which judicial
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final
determination of a Code violation, unless stayed by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the findings, decision and order of the Administrative Law Judge
may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   A.   Failure To Comply; Costs Of Enforcement: In any case in which a
respondent has failed to comply with a judgment ordering that respondent to
correct a Code violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of
a Code violation, any expenses incurred by the City to enforce the judgment
entered against that respondent, including, but not limited to, attorney fees,
court costs and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, repair
and/or enclosure of dangerous or unsafe buildings or uncompleted and abandoned
buildings, costs for the removal of garbage, debris and other hazardous,
noxious or unhealthy substances or materials from buildings or other real
property after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or an
Administrative Law Judge, shall be a debt due and owing the City and may be
collected in accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed
by the Administrative Law Judge pursuant to this section, the City shall
provide a notice to the respondent that states the respondent shall appear at a
hearing before the Administrative Law Judge to determine whether the respondent
has failed to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date for such
hearing, which shall not be less than seven (7) days from the date that notice
is served. If notice is served by mail, the seven (7) day period shall begin to
run on the date the notice was deposited in the mail.
   B.   Lien: Upon being recorded in the manner required by 735 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/12-101 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, or by 810
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/1-101 et seq., of the Uniform Commercial Code, a
lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the
respondent in the amount of any debt due and owing the City under this Code.
The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
   C.   Denial Of Services: If the respondent fails to pay any debt due and
owing the City as described in this section within fourteen (14) days after
service of the notice of debt, the City may take the following actions in
addition to any debt collection authorized by law:
      1.   Decline to issue, renew or provide any license, permit, zoning
variance or permission applied for or requested by respondent under any Code or
ordinance of the City until the respondent pays such debt; or
      2.   Decline to issue or renew residential parking permits, temporary
residential parking permits or passes, or any other permit required and applied
for by the respondent under any Code or ordinance of the City, until the
respondent pays such debt.
(1987 Code § 2.25-14)
1-4B-15: DEMOLITION, REPAIR, ENCLOSURE OR REMEDIATION:
   A.   Authority: Pursuant to 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-31-1, the
City has the authority to demolish, repair or enclose or cause the demolition,
repair or enclosure of dangerous and unsafe buildings or uncompleted and
abandoned buildings within the City and may remove or cause the removal of
garbage, debris and other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials from those buildings. When such action is warranted, the Director is
authorized, empowered and directed to:
      1.   Apply to the Hearing Officer:
         a.   For an order authorizing action to be taken with respect to a
building if the owner or owners of the building, including the lienholders of
record, after at least fifteen (15) days’ written notice by mail to do so, have
failed to put the building in a safe condition or to demolish it; or
         b.   For an order requiring the owner or owners of record to demolish,
repair or enclose the building or to remove garbage, debris and other
hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials from the building. It
is not a defense to the cause of action that the building is boarded up or
otherwise enclosed, although the Hearing Officer may order the defendant to
have the building boarded up or otherwise enclosed. Where, upon diligent
search, the identity or whereabouts of the owner or owners of the building,
including the lienholders of record, is not ascertainable, notice mailed to the
person or persons in whose name the real estate was last assessed is sufficient
notice under this section.
      2.   The hearing upon the application shall be expedited by the Hearing
Officer and shall be given precedence over all other suits.
      3.   The cost of the demolition, repair, enclosure or removal incurred by
the City, by an intervenor, or by a lienholder of record, including hearing
costs, attorney fees and other costs related to the enforcement of this
section, is recoverable from the owner or owners of the real estate or the
previous owner or both if the property was transferred during the fifteen (15)
day notice period and is a lien on the real estate; the lien is superior to all
prior existing liens and encumbrances, except taxes, if, within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the repair, demolition, enclosure or removal, the City,
the lienholder of record or the intervenor who incurred the cost and expense,
shall file a notice of lien for the cost and expense incurred in the Office of
the McHenry County Recorder of Deeds.
      4.   The notice must consist of a sworn statement setting out:
         a.   A description of the real estate sufficient for its
identification;
         b.   The amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred;
and
         c.   The date or dates when the cost and expense was incurred by the
City, the lienholder of record or the intervenor.
Upon payment of the cost and expense by the owner of or persons interested in
the property after the notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be
released by the City, the person in whose name the lien has been filed, or the
assignee of the lien, and the release may be filed of record as in the case of
filing notice of lien.
      5.   Unless the lien is enforced under subsection C of this section, the
lien may be enforced by foreclosure proceedings as in the case of mortgage
foreclosures under 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/15-1101 et seq., or
mechanics’ lien foreclosures. An action to foreclose this lien may be commenced
at any time after the date of filing of the notice of lien. The costs of
foreclosure incurred by the City, including hearing costs, reasonable attorney
fees, advances to preserve the property, and other costs related to the
enforcement of this section, plus statutory interest, are a lien on the real
estate and are recoverable by the City from the owner or owners of the real
estate.
      6.   All liens arising under this section shall be assignable. The
assignee of the lien shall have the same power to enforce the lien as the
assigning party, except that the lien may not be enforced under subsection B of
this section.
      7.   If the City determines that any dangerous and unsafe building or
uncompleted and abandoned building within the City fulfills the requirements
for an action by the City under 310 Illinois Compiled Statutes 50/1 et seq.,
the City may petition under that act in a proceeding brought under this
section.
   B.   Lien Enforcement: In any case where the City has obtained a lien, it
may enforce the lien pursuant to section
1-4B-14 of this article.
   C.   Petition For Abandonment:
      1.   In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the City may
petition the 22nd Judicial Circuit Court to have property declared abandoned
under this section if:
         a.   The property has been tax delinquent for two (2) or more years or
bills for water service for the property have been outstanding for two (2) or
more years;
         b.   The property is unoccupied by persons legally in possession; and
         c.   The property contains a dangerous or unsafe building for reasons
specified in the petition.
      2.   All persons having an interest of record in the property, including
tax purchasers and beneficial owners of any Illinois land trust having title to
the property, shall be named as defendants in the petition and shall be served
with process. In addition, service shall be had under 735 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/2-206 as in other cases affecting property.
      3.   The City, however, may proceed under this section in a proceeding
brought under subsection A of this section. Notice of the petition shall be
served in person or by certified or registered mail on all persons who were
served notice under subsection A of this section.
(1987 Code § 2.25-15)
      4.   If the City proves that the conditions described in this section
exist and: a) the owner of record of the property does not enter an appearance
in the action, or, if title to the property is held by an Illinois land trust,
if neither the owner of record nor the owner of the beneficial interest of the
trust enters an appearance; or b) if the owner of record or the beneficiary of
a land trust, if title to the property is held by an Illinois land trust,
enters an appearance and specifically waives their rights under this section,
the court shall declare the property abandoned. Notwithstanding any waiver, the
City may move to dismiss its petition at any time. In addition, any waiver in a
proceeding under this section does not serve as a waiver for any other
proceeding under law or equity.
(Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019)
      5.   If that determination is made, notice shall be sent in person or by
certified or registered mail to all persons having an interest of record in the
property, including tax purchasers and beneficial owners of any Illinois land
trust having title to the property, stating that title to the property will be
transferred to the City unless, within thirty (30) days of the notice, the
owner of record or any other person having an interest in the property files
with the court a request to demolish the dangerous or unsafe building or to put
the building in safe condition, or unless the owner of record enters an
appearance and proves that the owner does not intend to abandon the property.
(1987 Code § 2.25-15)
      6.   If the owner of record enters an appearance in the action within the
thirty (30) day period, but does not at that time file with the court a request
to demolish the dangerous or unsafe building or to put the building in safe
condition, or specifically waive their rights under this section, the court
shall vacate its order declaring the property abandoned if it determines that
the owner of record does not intend to abandon the property. In that case, the
City may amend its complaint in order to initiate proceedings under subsection
A of this section, or it may request that the court order the owner to demolish
the building or repair the dangerous or unsafe conditions of the building
alleged in the petition or seek the appointment of a receiver or other
equitable relief to correct the conditions at the property. The powers and
rights of a receiver appointed under this section shall include all of the
powers and rights of a receiver appointed under 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes
5/11-31-2.
(Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019)
      7.   If a request to demolish or repair the building is filed within the
thirty (30) day period, the court shall grant permission to the requesting
party to demolish the building within thirty (30) days or to restore the
building to safe condition within sixty (60) days after the request is granted.
An extension of that period for up to sixty (60) additional days may be given
for good cause. If more than one person with an interest in the property files
a timely request, preference shall be given to the owner of record if the owner
filed a request or, if the owner did not, the person with the lien or other
interest of the highest priority.
      8.   If the requesting party (other than the owner of record) proves to
the court that the building has been demolished or put in a safe condition in
accordance with the local Safety Codes within the period of time granted by the
court, the court shall issue a quitclaim judicial deed for the property to the
requesting party, conveying only the interest of the owner of record, upon
proof of payment to the City of all costs incurred by the City in connection
with the action, including, but not limited to, court costs, attorney fees,
administrative costs, the costs, if any, associated with building enclosure or
removal and receiver’s certificates. The interest in the property so conveyed
shall be subject to all liens and encumbrances on the property. In addition, if
the interest is conveyed to a person holding a certificate of purchase for the
property under 35 Illinois Compiled Statutes 200/1-1 et seq., the conveyance
shall be subject to the rights of redemption of all persons entitled to redeem
under that Act, including the original owner of record. If the requesting party
is the owner of record and proves to the court that the building has been
demolished or put in a safe condition in accordance with the local Safety Codes
within the period of time granted by the court, the court shall dismiss the
proceeding under this section.
      9.   If the owner of record has not entered an appearance and proven that
the owner did not intend to abandon the property, and if no person with an
interest in the property files a timely request or if the requesting party
fails to demolish the building or put the building in safe condition within the
time specified by the court, the City may petition the court to issue a
judicial deed for the property to the City. A conveyance by judicial deed shall
operate to extinguish all existing ownership interests in, liens on, and other
interest in the property, including tax liens, and shall extinguish the rights
and interests of any and all holders of a bona fide certificate of purchase of
the property for delinquent taxes. Any such bona fide certificate of purchase
holder shall be entitled to a sale in error as prescribed under 35 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 200/1-1 et seq.
   D.   Expedited Removal: The City may use the provisions of this subsection
to expedite the removal of certain buildings that are a continuing hazard in
the City.
      1.   If a residential or commercial building is three (3) stories or less
in height as defined by the City’s Building Code, and the Director of Community
Development determines that the building is open and vacant and an immediate
and continuing hazard to the City, then the Director of Community Development
shall be authorized to post a notice not less than two feet by two feet (2' x
2') in size on the front of the building. The notice shall be dated as of the
date of the posting and shall state that unless the building is demolished,
repaired or enclosed, and unless any garbage, debris and other hazardous,
noxious or unhealthy substances or materials are removed so that an immediate
and continuing hazard to the City no longer exists, then the building may be
demolished, repaired or enclosed, or any garbage, debris and other hazardous,
noxious or unhealthy substances or materials may be removed, by the City.
      2.   Not later than thirty (30) days following the posting of the notice,
the City shall do all of the following:
         a.   Cause to be sent, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a
notice to remediate to all owners of record of the property, the beneficial
owners of any Illinois land trust having title to the property, and all
lienholders of record in the property, stating the intent of the City to
demolish, repair or enclose the building or remove any garbage, debris or other
hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials if that action is not
taken by the owner or owners.
         b.   Cause to be published, in a newspaper published or circulated in
the City, a notice setting forth: 1) the permanent tax index number and the
address of the building; 2) a statement that the property is open and vacant
and constitutes an immediate and continuing hazard to the community; and 3) a
statement that the City intends to demolish, repair or enclose the building or
remove any garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances
or materials if the owner or owners or lienholders of record fail to do so.
This notice shall be published for three (3) consecutive days.
         c.   Cause to be recorded the notice to remediate mailed in the Office
of the McHenry County Recorder of Deeds.
(1987 Code § 2.25-15)
      3.   Any person or persons with a current legal or equitable interest in
the property objecting to the proposed actions of the Director of Community
Development may file their objection in an appropriate form in the Office of
Administrative Adjudication.
(Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019)
      4.   If the building is not demolished, repaired or enclosed or the
garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or
materials are not removed, within thirty (30) days of mailing the notice to the
owners of record, the beneficial owners of any Illinois land trust having title
to the property, and all lienholders of record in the property, or within
thirty (30) days of the last day of publication of the notice, whichever is
later, the Director of Community Development shall have the power to demolish,
repair or enclose the building or to remove any garbage, debris or other
hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances or materials.
      5.   The City may proceed to demolish, repair or enclose a building or
remove any garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances
or materials under this subsection D within a one hundred twenty (120) day
period following the date of the mailing of the notice if the Director of
Community Development determines that the demolition, repair, enclosure or
removal of any garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy
substances or materials is necessary to remedy the immediate and continuing
hazard. If, however, before the City proceeds with any of the actions
authorized by this subsection D, any person with a legal or equitable interest
in the property has sought a hearing under this section before the Office of
Administrative Adjudication and has served a copy of the complaint on the City
Administrator, then the City shall not proceed with the demolition, repair or
enclosure or removal of garbage, debris or other substances until the Hearing
Officer determines that action is necessary to remedy the hazard and issues an
order authorizing the City to do so. If the Hearing Officer dismisses the
action for want of prosecution, the City must send the objector a copy of the
dismissal order and a letter stating that the demolition, repair, enclosure or
removal of garbage, debris or other substances will proceed unless, within
thirty (30) days after the copy of the order and the letter are mailed, the
objector moves to vacate the dismissal and serves a copy of the motion on the
City Administrator. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, if the
objector does not file a motion and give the required notice, if the motion is
denied by the Hearing Officer, or if the action is again dismissed for want of
prosecution, then the dismissal is with prejudice and the demolition, repair,
enclosure or removal may proceed forthwith.
      6.   Following the demolition, repair or enclosure of a building, or the
removal of garbage, debris or other hazardous, noxious or unhealthy substances
or materials under this section, the City may file a notice of lien against the
real estate for the cost of the demolition, repair, enclosure or removal within
one hundred eighty (180) days after the repair, demolition, enclosure or
removal occurred, for the cost and expense incurred, in the Office of the
McHenry County Recorder of Deeds. This lien has priority over the interests of
those parties named in the notice to remediate mailed under subsection D2a of
this section, but not over the interests of third party purchasers or
encumbrancer for value who obtained their interests in the property before
obtaining actual or constructive notice of the lien.
      7.   The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting forth:
         a.   A description of the real estate, such as the address or other
description of the property, sufficient for its identification;
         b.   The expenses incurred by the City in undertaking the remedial
actions authorized under this section;
         c.   The date or dates the expenses were incurred by the City;
         d.   A statement by the Director of Community Development that the
building was open and vacant and constituted an immediate and continuing hazard
to the community;
         e.   A statement by the Director of Community Development that the
required sign was posted on the building, that notice was sent by certified
mail to the owners of record, and that notice was published in accordance with
this section; and
         f.   A statement as to when and where the notice was published.
      8.   The lien authorized by this section may thereafter be released or
enforced by the City as provided in subsection A of this section.
   E.   Hazardous Substances, Petroleum Products:
      1.   The City may remove or cause the removal of, or otherwise
environmentally remediate hazardous substances and petroleum products on, in or
under any abandoned and unsafe property within the City. In addition, where
preliminary evidence indicates the presence or likely presence of a hazardous
substance or a petroleum product or a release or a substantial threat of a
release of a hazardous substance or a petroleum product on, in or under the
property, the City may inspect the property and test for the presence or
release of hazardous substances and petroleum products.
      2.   For purposes of this section:
      ABANDONED:
         a.   The property has been tax delinquent for two (2) or more years;
         b.   The property is unoccupied by persons legally in possession.
      HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES: Means the same as in 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes
5/3.215.
      PROPERTY OR REAL ESTATE: All real property, whether or not improved by a
structure.
      UNSAFE: Property that presents an actual or imminent threat to public
health and safety caused by the release of hazardous substances.
      3.   The Code Administrator shall apply to the Hearing Officer: a) for an
order allowing the entry to the property and inspect and test substances on, in
or under the property; or b) for an order authorizing the Code Administrator to
take action with respect to remediation of the property if conditions on the
property, based on the inspection and testing authorized in item a of this
subsection, indicate the presence of hazardous substances or petroleum
products. Remediation shall be deemed complete for purposes of item b of this
subsection when the property satisfies tier I, II or III remediation objectives
for the property’s most recent usage, as established by 415 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/1 et seq., and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Where, upon diligent search, the identity or whereabouts of the owner or owners
of the property, including the lienholders of record, is not ascertainable,
notice mailed to the person or persons in whose name the real estate was last
assessed is sufficient notice under this section.
      4.   The Hearing Officer shall grant an order authorizing testing under
item a of subsection E3 of this section upon a showing of preliminary evidence
indicating the presence or likely presence of a hazardous substance or a
petroleum product, or a release of or a substantial threat of a release of a
hazardous substance or a petroleum product on, in or under abandoned property.
The preliminary evidence may include, but is not limited to, evidence of prior
use, visual site inspection or records of prior environmental investigations.
The testing authorized by item a of subsection E3 of this section shall include
any type of investigation which is necessary for an environmental professional
to determine the environmental condition of the property, including, but not
limited to, performance of soil borings and groundwater monitoring. The Hearing
Officer shall grant a remediation order under item b of subsection E3 of this
section where testing of the property indicates that it fails to meet the
applicable remediation objectives. The hearing upon the application to the
Hearing Officer shall be expedited and shall be given precedence over all other
suits.
      5.   The cost of the inspection, testing or remediation incurred by the
City or by a lienholder of record, including court costs, attorney fees, and
other costs related to the enforcement of this section, is a lien on the real
estate; except that in any instances where the City incurs costs of inspection
and testing but finds no hazardous substances or petroleum products on the
property that present an actual or imminent threat to public health and safety,
such costs are not recoverable from the owners nor are such costs a lien on the
real estate. The lien is superior to all prior existing liens and encumbrances,
except taxes and any lien obtained under subsection A or D of this section, if,
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the completion of the inspection,
testing or remediation, the City or the lienholder of record who incurred the
cost and expense shall file a notice of lien for the cost and expense incurred
in the Office of the McHenry County Recorder of Deeds.
      6.   The notice must consist of a sworn statement setting out: a) a
description of the real estate sufficient for its identification; b) the amount
of money representing the cost and expense incurred; and c) the date or dates
when the cost and expense was incurred by the City or the lienholder of record.
Upon payment of the lien amount by the owner of or persons interested in the
property after the notice of lien has been filed, a release of lien shall be
issued by the City, the person in whose name the lien has been filed, or the
assignee of the lien, and the release may be filed of record as in the case of
filing notice of lien.
      7.   The lien may be enforced under subsection B of this section or by
foreclosure proceedings as in the case of mortgage foreclosures under 735
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/15-1101 et seq., or mechanics’ lien foreclosures;
provided, that where the lien is enforced by foreclosure under subsection B of
this section or under either statute, the City may not proceed against the
other assets of the owner or owners of the real estate for any costs that
otherwise would be recoverable under this section but that remain unsatisfied
after foreclosure except where such additional recovery is authorized by
separate Environmental Laws. An action to foreclose this lien may be commenced
at any time after the date of filing of the notice of lien. The costs of
foreclosure incurred by the City, including court costs, reasonable attorney
fees, advances to preserve the property, and other costs related to the
enforcement of this section, plus statutory interest, are a lien on the real
estate.
      8.   All liens arising under this section shall be assignable. The
assignee of the lien shall have the same power to enforce the lien as the
assigning party, except that the lien may not be enforced under subsection B of
this section.
   F.   Money Judgment: In any case where the City has obtained a lien under
subsection A of this section, the City may also bring an action for a money
judgment against the owner or owners of the real estate in the amount of the
lien in the same manner as provided for bringing causes of action in 735
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/2-101 and, upon obtaining a judgment, file a
judgment lien against all of the real estate of the owner or owners and enforce
that lien as provided for in 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/2-101.

To demonstrate that the motor vehicle, or the registration plates, was stolen
before the violation occurred and was not under the control or possession of
the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a
report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed
with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.

   J.   Final Determination Of Violation Liability: A final determination of
violation liability shall occur following failure to pay the fine and any
applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits, and upon the
exhaustion of the administrative review procedures. When a person fails to
appear at their scheduled hearing to contest an alleged violation, the
Administrative Law Judge’s determination of violation liability shall become
final: 1) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination; or
2) upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing
having been made.
(Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019)
   K.   Appeals: A petition to void a determination may be filed by a person
owing an unpaid fine or penalty and shall be filed within thirty (30) days of
the finding of liability and shall be ruled upon by the Administrative Law
Judge. The grounds for such a petition are limited to:
      1.   The person was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the
date the violation notice was issued; or
      2.   The person had paid the fine or penalty for the violation in
question; or
      3.   Excusable failure to appear at or request a date for a hearing.
When it has been determined there is just cause, the registered owner shall be
provided with a hearing on the merits for the violation.

within the City, the violation may be contested in writing pursuant to the
notice of violation. In such circumstances, the nonresident may submit their
position, in writing, signed and under oath, to the Administrative Law Judge,
setting forth the reasons why a finding of liability should not be entered and
why the issuance of the violation was improper. Said written challenge must be
submitted not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing as noted on the
notice of violation.

addition to imprisonment, the City may elect to institute an action with the
Office of Administrative Adjudication and waive any imprisonment for the Code
violation. Nothing in this section, however, shall preclude the City from
seeking the remedy of imprisonment in a court of competent jurisdiction.

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application, but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. Except for the amount of tax and interest due
under this Section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application

before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax
Administrator, whichever is longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
Chapter must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and

shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the Local Tax Administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the City's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
It shall not be considered an improper lien under this section when a validly-
imposed lien is removed because the taxpayer has ultimately satisfied their
outstanding tax, interest and penalties liability. The taxpayer shall bear the
cost to remove such a lien.
(Ord. 20-31, 8-3-2020)

3-10-5: PAYMENT OF TAX TO THE CITY/RETURNS:
   A.   Collection Of Tax: The person maintaining a place of business in the
state of Illinois who delivers the electricity to the purchaser shall collect
the tax authorized by this Chapter from the purchaser and shall file a return
with, and pay the amount of the tax collected to, the City. This tax
constitutes a debt of the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity
to the purchaser and is recoverable at the same time and in the same manner as
the original charge for delivering the electricity.
   B.   Persons delivering electricity may collect the tax from the purchaser
by adding the tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons
delivering electricity also are authorized to add to the gross charge an amount
equal to three percent (3%) of the tax to reimburse the person delivering
electricity for the expense incurred in keeping records, billing customers,
preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax, and supplying data to the City
on the City's request.
   C.   Any tax required to be collected pursuant to this Chapter and any such
tax collected by a person delivering electricity constitutes a debt owed to the
City by the person delivering the electricity. With respect to such debt owed
to the City, the person delivering electricity may be allowed a credit against
such debt to the extent the tax related to deliveries of electricity is not
collected because the charges for such electricity are written off as
uncollectible; except that if such charges are thereafter collected by the
person delivering electricity, then that person must remit the tax to the City.
Any partial payment not specifically identified by the purchaser will be deemed
to be for the delivery of electricity.
   D.   Every person who delivers electricity to a purchaser shall on a monthly
basis file a return in a form and manner prescribed by the City's Finance
Director. The return and accompanying payment shall be due on or before the
last day of the month following the month during which the tax is collected or
is required to be collected under this Chapter.
   E.   If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the
purchaser, then the purchaser will be required to pay the tax directly to the
City, on or before the last day of the month following the month during which
electricity is used or consumed, by filing a tax return in the form and manner
that the City Finance Director will prescribe.
(Ord. 22-12, 2-22-2022; amd. Ord. 22-21, 3-21-2022)
3-10-6: CREDITS FOR OVERPAYMENT; LIMITATION:
If it appears that an amount of tax has been paid that was not due under the
provisions of this Chapter, whether as a result of a mistake of fact or an
error of law, then that amount will be credited against any tax due, or to
become due, under this Chapter from the person who made the erroneous payment
on a filing of a claim for a credit by that person with the City, except that
no amount erroneously paid will be credited if that amount was paid more than
one (1) year prior to the filing of a claim for a credit.

collects the tax authorized by this Chapter from the purchaser is required to
keep accurate books and records of its business or activity, including

may have given rise, to any tax liability under this Chapter. The books and
records are subject to and available for inspection by the City at reasonable
times during normal business hours.

3-10-9: RESALES:
   A.   Electricity that is delivered to a person in the City shall be
considered to be for use and consumption by that person unless the person
receiving the electricity has an active resale number issued by the City
Finance Director and furnishes that number to the person who delivers the
electricity and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or
partially nontaxable as a sale for resale.
   B.   If a person who receives electricity in the City claims to be an
authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the City Finance
Director for a resale number. The applicant shall state facts showing why it is
not liable for the tax imposed by this section on any purchases of electricity
and shall furnish such additional information as the City Finance Director may
reasonably require.
   C.   Upon approval of the application, the City Finance Director shall
assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the
applicant.
   D.   The City Finance Director may cancel the resale number of any person if
the person fails to pay any tax payable under this Chapter for electricity used
or consumed by the person, or if the number was either (1) obtained through
misrepresentation, or (2) no longer necessary because the person has
discontinued making resales.
   E.   If a reseller had acquired electricity partly for use or consumption
and partly for resale, the reseller shall collect and remit the tax imposed by
this Chapter directly to the City Finance Director, under the rules prescribed
by this Chapter, on any amount that is used or consumed by the reseller and any
amount delivered by the reseller for use and consumption and not as a sale for
resale.
   F.   Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active
resale number and complying with all other conditions in this Chapter shall be
excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the electricity
delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports the total amount of
electricity delivered to the reseller, and such other information that the City
Finance Director may reasonably require.

conduct incidental to and necessary for the conveyance or communication of a

utilized to exploit the conduct of being nude for profit or commercial gain and

6-5A-29: STREET GANG ACTIVITY:
   A.   City Council Findings:
      1.   The City Council hereby finds and declares that it is the right of
every person, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex,
age or disability to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation and
physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals. It is
not the intent of this section to interfere with the exercise of the
constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association. The
City Council hereby recognizes the constitutional right of every citizen to
harbor and express beliefs on any lawful subject whatsoever, to lawfully
associate with others who shall have similar beliefs, to petition lawfully
constituted authority for a redress of perceived grievances, and to participate
in the electoral process.
      2.   The City Council finds, however, that urban, suburban and rural
communities, neighborhoods and schools throughout the State are being
terrorized and plundered by street gangs. The City Council finds that there are
now several hundred street gangs operating in Illinois, and that while their
terrorism is most widespread in urban areas, street gangs are spreading into
suburban and rural areas of Illinois, including McHenry County.
      3.   The City Council further finds that street gangs are often
controlled by criminally sophisticated adults who take advantage of our youth
by intimidating and coercing them into membership by employing them as drug
couriers and runners, and by using them to commit brutal crimes against persons
and property to further the financial benefit to and dominance of the street
gang.
      4.   Street gang activity presents a clear and present danger to public
order and safety and is not constitutionally protected. No society is or should
be required to endure such activities without redress. Accordingly, it is the
intent of the City Council, by enacting this section, to prohibit street gang
related activity.

defined as any ongoing organization, association in fact or group of three (3)
or more persons, whether formally or informally organized, or any subgroup or

criminal or illegal acts, including by way of example only and not in any way
limiting or specifying, illegal drug distribution, and whose members
individually or collectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal
or illegal acts, and which group frequently, though not necessarily, claim one
or more particular geographic territory or “turf” exclusively as its realm of
influence and operations.
   C.   Colors, Emblems Or Insignia: It shall be unlawful for any person within
the City to knowingly use, display or wear colors, emblems or insignia on or
about their person in public for the purpose of promoting any street gang
activity.
   D.   Act, Utterance, Gesture Or Display: It shall be unlawful for any person
within the City to knowingly do or make any act, utterance, gesture or display

with, support of, identification with, sympathy toward or affront or insult
toward any street gang, or with actual knowledge that the subject act,
utterance, gesture or display is used and recognized as communicative of street
gang membership, affiliation, association, support, identification, sympathy or
affront.

violating any provision of this chapter shall be fined according to the Fines

permittee.
   F.   Revisions: The City may issue revisions to permits:
      1.   To correct an error attributed to the City;

state for the power unit, and vehicle identification number (VIN). The serial
number of the power unit and/or owner applied number shall also be listed, if
applicable.
   P.   Violation: Any violation of these terms will render the permit null and
void, and subject the driver, firm, business or corporation that owns the
vehicle to legal weight and dimension laws. The arresting police officer will
immediately confiscate the permit. (Ord. 98-714, 10-7-1998)

7-10-6: ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION HEARING:
   A.   Appointment Of Law Judge: The City shall appoint an individual, not
employed by the Police Department, to serve as an Administrative Law Judge for
purposes of this chapter. (See title 1, chapter 4, article B, “Administrative
Adjudication”, of this Code.)
   B.   Notification; Hearing; Plea: Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is
seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the City shall notify, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the date, time
and location of a plea hearing that will be conducted in accordance with title
1, chapter 4, article B, “Administrative Adjudication”, of this Code. The owner
will appear at a hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If a plea of
guilty is entered, the case will be disposed of at that time. If the owner
pleads not guilty, a final hearing shall be conducted on that date unless
continued by order of the Administrative Law Judge. An owner of record can
request the scheduled plea hearing date be continued, as long as the request
for continuance is made no later than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
hearing. In the event that the City is seeking to forfeit the vehicle pursuant
to applicable law, these impoundment proceedings shall be stayed pending the
final disposition of the forfeiture proceedings. If the vehicle is forfeited,
the impoundment proceeding pursuant to this chapter shall be dismissed by the
City. If the vehicle is not forfeited, the City shall schedule a plea hearing
within ten (10) days of receipt of the final order in the forfeiture proceeding
and shall notify the owner of said plea hearing as provided herein.
   C.   Hearing; Rules Of Evidence: All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence
shall not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. In a
hearing on the propriety of impoundment of a vehicle, any sworn or affirmed
report, citation or ticket that: 1) is prepared in the performance of a law
enforcement officer’s duties; and 2) sufficiently describes the circumstances
leading to the impoundment, shall be admissible evidence of the vehicle owner’s
liability, unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
   D.   Finding Owner Liable: If, after the hearing, the Administrative Law
Judge determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in
violation of this chapter, the Administrative Law Judge shall then enter an
order finding the owner of record of the vehicle liable to the City for the
administrative penalty.
   E.   Return Of Vehicle: If, after the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge
does not determine by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in
such a violation, the Administrative Law Judge shall enter an order finding for
the owner and for the return of the vehicle.
   F.   Failure To Appear: If the owner of record requests a hearing but fails
to appear at the hearing or fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the
owner of record shall be deemed to have waived their right to a hearing and the
Administrative Law Judge shall enter a default order in favor of the City in
the amount of the administrative penalty. Once the order has been entered, the
City shall make a reasonable effort to notify any lienholder of the default
order entered against the owner of record.
   G.   Default Order: If a default order is entered against the owner of
record for failing to request or appear at a hearing, the owner of record may
make a request to vacate the default judgment. The motion shall be made in
writing and sent by certified mail to the Administrative Law Judge within
thirty (30) days of the default order being entered. Once such a request is
made, the default order will be vacated and the administrative adjudication
hearing will be set within ten (10) days of the request.
   H.   Default Orders: If the owner of record pays such an administrative
penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner, no default order need be
entered if the owner is informed of their right to a hearing and signs a
waiver, in which case an order of liability shall be deemed to have been made
when the City receives the written waiver.
(1987 Code § 13-20; amd. Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019; amd. Ord. 24-43, 8-19-2024)
7-10-7: POSTING OF CASH BOND:
   A.   Vehicle Release: If a cash bond is posted with the Police Department,
the impounded vehicle shall be released to the owner of record. However, the
vehicle owner shall remain liable to the towing agent for any applicable towing
or storage fees.
   B.   Forfeit: If an administrative penalty is imposed by the Administrative
Law Judge for a violation of this chapter, the cash bond shall be forfeited to
the City. However, if a violation of this chapter is not proven by a
preponderance of the evidence, the cash bond shall be returned to the person
posting the cash bond.
   C.   Held Until Decision Issued: All cash bonds posted pursuant to this
chapter shall be held by the City until the Administrative Law Judge has issued
a decision.
   D.   Form Of Bond: The cash bond posted shall be in the form of cash, money
order, certified check, E-check or any authorized credit or debit cards.
(1987 Code § 13-21; amd. Ord. 24-43, 8-19-2024)
7-10-8: PENDING FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS:
When a vehicle is the subject to forfeiture proceedings by the City, the owner
shall not be permitted to post the cash bond and pay the towing and storage
charges for release of the vehicle until the forfeiture proceedings have
concluded. In the event forfeiture of the vehicle is granted by the court,
these impoundment proceedings shall be dismissed.
(1987 Code § 13-22; amd. Ord. 24-43, 8-19-2024)
7-10-9: ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY:
   A.   Debt Due: If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this
chapter, such administrative penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to
the City. If a vehicle has been impounded when such an administrative penalty
is imposed, the City may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such
judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise
in this chapter, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the
administrative penalty is paid to the City and any applicable towing and
storage fees are paid to the towing agent, in which case possession of the
vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the
vehicle, or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment
to enforce a lien as provided by law.
   B.   Failure To Pay: If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are
not paid within thirty (30) days after an administrative penalty is imposed
against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing,
the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner
provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases,
if the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within thirty
(30) days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of the
Administrative Law Judge’s determination may be sought, or within thirty (30)
days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor
of the City, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code. However, where proceedings
have been instituted under State or Federal Drug Asset Forfeiture Laws,
disposal of the subject vehicle shall be consistent with those proceedings.
(1987 Code § 13-23; amd. Ord. 24-43, 8-19-2024)
7-10-10: VEHICLE POSSESSION:
   A.   Policy: Except as otherwise provided by law, no owner, lienholder or
other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle
impounded under this chapter until the administrative penalty and fees
applicable under this chapter have been paid. However, whenever a person with a
lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure
proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if he
agrees in writing to refund the City the amount of the net proceeds of any
foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lienholders of record,
not to exceed the administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees.
   B.   Owner Of Record: For purposes of this chapter, the “owner of record” of
a vehicle is the record title holder as registered with the Illinois Secretary
of State.

8-3C-1: PURPOSE:
The tree preservation requirements specified herein are intended to foster
aesthetically pleasing development that will protect and preserve the
appearance, character, general health, safety and welfare of the community and
enhance property values. Specifically, these regulations are intended to
increase the compatibility of adjacent uses by preserving natural areas that
become buffers between uses and in doing so, minimize the harmful impact of
noise, dust and other debris; motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial
light intrusions, and other objectionable activities or impacts conducted or
created by adjoining or nearby uses; reduce topsoil erosion and stormwater
runoff; reduce energy consumption through windbreak and shade; and preserve
nesting for birds and wildlife.

conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
City’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
wetlands and other sensitive areas from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the historical and aesthetic character of the neighborhoods
in which facilities are installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the City’s residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use, maintenance of property values and
enjoyment of private properties adjacent to utility facilities locations.

appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the City, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(1987 Code § 21-97)
8-7-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in
an amount set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs
or expenses that the City may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter, including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the City must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the City from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the City in the
form of an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the City.
Such letter of credit provided pursuant to this section shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without thirty (30) days’ prior
written notice by certified mail to the City and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the City of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the City and within the State
at which it can be drawn.

provide for one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the reasonably estimated
cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that
existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the
Public Works Director, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs
that the City estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to
perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under
the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the City, with
each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a
related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase
or phases, the Public Works Director may, in the exercise of sound discretion,
allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be
applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this section for any
single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The City, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this section, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund; provided,
that the permittee has not reimbursed the City for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the City for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the City has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the City
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the City that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund,
the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in this
section.
   F.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the City for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the City as a result of said revocation; provided,
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   G.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the City with respect to the
Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved
by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other
right the City may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which
may be infringed or otherwise violated.
   H.   Security For Removal Of Facility: In addition, as a condition precedent
to the commencement of work in the City right-of-way, the applicant shall
deposit with the City an unconditional letter of credit in the amount of one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of the City’s engineer estimated amount to remove
the facility from the City’s right-of-way in the event that the facility is not
used to provide service for ninety (90) days in which case it will be deemed
abandoned and may be removed by the City.

agency for public safety communications.
         b.   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency’s communications equipment.
         c.   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC’s regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         d.   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC,
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973, and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         e.   The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous subsection. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.

installed at grade, screening must be installed to minimize the visibility of
the facility and shall not be permitted to obstruct sight lines or to create
other traffic or safety problems.
         b.   Color And Stealth: All wireless facilities subject to this
section, including all related equipment and appurtenances, must be a color
that blends with the surroundings of the pole, structure tower or
infrastructure on which it is mounted. The color must be comprised of
nonreflective materials which blend with the materials and colors of the
surrounding area and structures. The applicant shall use good faith efforts to
employ reasonable stealth techniques to conceal the appearance of the wireless
facilities. Any pole extensions shall not be metallic or wood and shall blend
with the color of the pole upon which they are mounted.
         c.   Wiring And Cabling: Wires and cables connecting the antenna to
the remainder of the facility must be installed in accordance with the National
Electrical Code and National Electrical Safety Code adopted by the City and in

will be allowed to interfere with any existing uses.
      7.   Alternate Placements:
         a.   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and
conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that
the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the
proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to
use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the
alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional
material costs as determined by the applicant.
         b.   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this subsection.
      8.   Height Limitations:
         a.   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support structure on
which the small wireless facility is collocated.

on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
            (1)   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility
pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in
place on the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located
within three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or
wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the City, provided the City may designate which
intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
            (2)   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in the manner provided in section
8-7-22 of this chapter.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the City and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to
utility poles and ground mounted equipment located in the right- of-way.

section
8-7-22 of this chapter and State law, the wireless provider shall comply with
the provisions of this section concerning undergrounding requirements that
prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles
in a right-of-way without prior approval.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this
period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility pole or
by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty
(360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void
unless the City grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   F.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on

      5.   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the City to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   G.   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this section authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the City or another unit of local government that is not located within rights-
of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure without
the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      3.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service, or an electric utility as defined in 220 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail
carrier, public commuter rail service or electric utility. The provisions of
this section do not apply to an electric or gas public utility or such
utility’s wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed and
maintained consistent with the provisions of 220 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/
16-108.5(i) of the Public Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, “public utility” has the meaning given to
that term in 220 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-105 of the Public Utilities
Act. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve any person from any
requirement: a) to obtain a franchise or a State issued authorization to offer
cable service or video service; or b) to obtain any required permission to
install, place, maintain or operate communications facilities, other than small
wireless facilities subject to this section.
   H.   Pre-Existing Agreements:
      1.   Existing agreements between the City and wireless providers that
relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way,
including the collocation of small wireless facilities on City utility poles,
that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small wireless
facilities collocated on the City’s utility poles pursuant to applications
submitted to the City before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination
provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall
comply with this section.
      2.   A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the City on
the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the
City makes available under this section for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two
(2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the City
that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement
remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small
wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the City’s utility
poles pursuant to applications submitted to the City before the wireless
provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this subsection.
   I.   Annual Recurring Rate:
      1.   A wireless provider shall pay to the City an annual recurring rate
to collocate a small wireless facility on a City utility pole located in a
right-of-way that equals: a) two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year; or b) the

      1.   A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous
period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the
facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety (90) days after
receipt of written notice from the City notifying the wireless provider of the
abandonment.
      2.   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the City to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the City may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal
utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
      3.   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the City if it
sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the
City. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new
wireless provider.
   K.   Dispute Resolution: The Circuit Court of McHenry County shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless
Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for
collocation of small wireless facilities on Municipal utility poles within the
right-of-way, the City shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its
poles at annual rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year
per Municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution
of the dispute.
   L.   Indemnification: A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the City
harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property
damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or
occupancy of the City improvements or right-of-way associated with such
improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents or contractors
arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this section and the
Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless
against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole
negligence of the City or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall
further waive any claims that they may have against the City with respect to
consequential, incidental or special damages, however caused, based on the
theory of liability.
   M.   Insurance:
      1.   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider’s own
cost and expense, such insurance as is required by section
8-7-8 of this chapter.
      2.   The wireless provider shall include the City as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification
and documentation of inclusion of the City in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
      3.   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the City. A wireless
provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds
under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the City evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the City.

The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain
and other property within ten (10) days after any portion of the rights-of-way
are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by the
utility, all to the satisfaction of the City. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the Public Works Director. Such clean up and
repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding,
resodding or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition
substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the
project. The time period provided in this section may be extended by the Public
Works Director for good cause shown.

8-7-21: MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE:
   A.   General: Facilities and any associated screening or landscaping on,
over, above, along, upon, under, across or within rights-of-way are to be
maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the City and at
the utility’s expense.
   B.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify noncompliance
with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way,
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers.
If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency
is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in
repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the
shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of
access to the facility is available.
(1987 Code § 21-108)
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Public Works Director, or their duly authorized agent, of the emergency,
informing them as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
Police Department shall be notified immediately. If applicant does not act in
accordance with these provisions, the City may do so and all costs incurred by
City must be reimbursed by the applicant.
(Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019)

of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the Public Works
Director as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each
provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons
why a variance should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The Public Works Director shall decide
whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified
in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The Public Works Director may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are not
practical in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Public Works Director may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Public
Works Director under the provisions of this chapter, shall have the right to
appeal to the City Council, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City
Clerk within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The City Council shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at a City Council’s regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least fourteen (14) days after the filing of the appeal. The City
Council shall timely decide the appeal.

8-7-23: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the City will
incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the City’s costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the City. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
(1987 Code § 21-110)
8-7-24: FURTHER ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the City may have for enforcement of this chapter.

9-4B-1: METERED USERS SERVICE CHARGES, COSTS:
   A.   User Service Rates: The following user service rates are established
for the metered use of and for the service supplied by the City sewerage works,
which shall be billed on a bimonthly basis.
      1.   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or other City approved metering devices for the purpose of
paying all expenses associated with operation, maintenance and replacement of
the sewerage system. The basic user charge shall be determined by dividing the
total of annual operation, maintenance and replacement expenses by the total
number of gallons billed for sewer service in the twelve (12) month period
immediately preceding the calculation. This calculation shall produce a unit
rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons for sewer service supplied, which shall
be billed to all users as the basic user charge.
The basic user charge will be applicable for average and below average strength
sewage. Average strength sewage is determined to have the following
characteristics:
         a.   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD5) of two hundred forty milligrams per liter (240 mg/L).
         b.   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred seventy five
milligrams per liter (275 mg/L).
      2.   A treatment service surcharge will be charged to all users whose
discharges exceed the average concentrations for BOD5 (240 mg/L) and SS (275
mg/L). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters
and/or other City approved metering devices for all wastes which exceed the
parameters outlined above. The unit rate of BOD5 and SS surcharge calculations
shall be computed as follows:
         a.   Proportion the estimated annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including equipment replacement to the
major plant categories.
         b.   Proportion the costs of the major plant categories to BOD5 and
SS.
         c.   Estimate the pounds of BOD5 and SS treated.
         d.   Compute the unit costs per pound of BOD5 and SS.
   B.   Annual Review: The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be
reviewed annually and shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt
service or a change in operation, maintenance and equipment replacement costs.
   C.   Notification To Users: The users of wastewater treatment services will
be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rates and that
portion of the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater treatment
operation, maintenance and replacement.
   D.   Determination Of Annual Water Use: Annual water use shall be determined
from readings taken from approved water meters and/or other City approved
metering devices for wastewater and flat rate user estimates.
   E.   Treatment Service Surcharge: A treatment service surcharge shall be
levied to all sewer users whose wastewater exceeds normal concentrations of two
hundred forty milligrams per liter (240 mg/L) of BOD5, two hundred seventy five
milligrams per liter (275 mg/L) of suspended solids as determined by waste
sampling, which shall be performed as often as deemed necessary by the Director
and shall be binding as the basis for computing the surcharge.
   F.   User Rates: Basic user rates shall be reflected in the May billing year
for metered service.
      1.   Effective on and after August 1, 2024, the sewer rates shall be as
follows for metered uses:
 
Within the corporate limits of the City:
 Class 1 uses $4.59 per 1,000 gallons
 Class 2 uses 4.43 per 1,000 gallons
Outside corporate limits of the City:
 Class 1 uses 6.89 per 1,000 gallons
 Class 2 uses 6.65 per 1,000 gallons
 
In addition, on and after January 1, 2022, each user shall pay a base charge
with each bi-monthly invoice, which shall be applied to operations and
maintenance and capital costs associated with the City’s sewer treatment and
collection system as well as operating and maintenance expenses associated with

shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, the samples for solids analyses are
obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples. The cost of measurements, tests and
analysis for the purpose of determining treatment service surcharges shall be
paid for by the user at their expense.

conditions of this article. The scope and purpose of this article is to aid in
the prevention of sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions from contributions
and accumulations of fats, oils and greases into the sanitary sewer system from
food service establishments.
(1987 Code § 26-155)
9-4E-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following words and phrases used in this article shall have the following
meanings unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context:
FATS, OILS AND GREASES: Organic polar compounds derived from animal and/or
plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules. These
substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures
established in the United States Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 136,
amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as “grease” or
“greases”.
FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS: Those establishments primarily engaged in
activities of preparing, serving or otherwise making available for public
consumption food, including, but not limited to: restaurants, commercial
kitchens, caterers, hotels, schools, hospitals, prisons, correctional
facilities and care institutions. These establishments use one or more of the
following preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all
methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods),
boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting or poaching. Also, included are infrared
heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation activity that
produces a hot, nondrinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires
washing.
GREASE INTERCEPTOR: A structure or device designed for the purpose of removing
and preventing fats, oils and grease from entering the sanitary sewer
collection system. These devices are often belowground units in outside areas
and are built as two (2) or three (3) chamber baffled tanks.
GREASE TRAP: A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and
grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Such traps are typically
compact under the sink units that are near food preparation areas.

ability or volume required to effectively intercept and retain greases from
grease laden wastewaters discharged into the public sanitary sewer system.
USER: Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional limits of
the City of McHenry, who contributes, causes or permits the contribution or
discharge of wastewater into sewers within the City of McHenry’s boundaries.
(1987 Code § 26-156)
9-4E-3: FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS; PERMIT REQUIREMENT:
All permitted food service establishments discharging wastewater into the City
sanitary sewer collection system are subject to the following requirements:
   A.   Grease Interceptor Requirements: All permitted food service
establishments are required to install, operate and maintain an approved type
and adequately sized grease interceptor/trap necessary to maintain compliance
with the objectives of this article. All grease interceptors must meet the
requirements of the current Illinois State Plumbing Code.
   B.   Implementation:
      1.   All new food service establishment facilities are subject to grease
interceptor/trap requirements. All such facilities must obtain prior approval
from the Public Works Director or designee for grease interceptor/trap sizing
prior to submitting plans for a building permit. All grease interceptor/traps
shall be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Existing
facilities with planned modifications to plumbing improvements will be required
to include plans to comply with the grease interceptor requirements. These
facilities must obtain approval from the Public Works Director or designee for
grease interceptor sizing prior to submitting plans for a building permit.
      2.   All existing food service establishments, determined by the Public
Works Director or designee, having the potential to adversely impact the City’s
sewer system will be notified of their obligation to install a grease
interceptor within the specified period set forth in the notification letter.
   C.   Variance From Grease Interceptor Requirements:
      1.   Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed
unless the Public Works Director or designee authorizes the installation of an
indoor grease trap or other alternative pretreatment technology and determines
the installation of a grease interceptor would not be feasible. The food
service establishment bears the burden of demonstrating the installation of a
grease interceptor/trap is not feasible. The Public Works Director or designee
may authorize the installation of an indoor grease trap where the installation
of a grease interceptor is not feasible due to space constraints or other
considerations. Financial hardship does not qualify as a consideration. If an
establishment believes the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible
because of documented space constraints, the request for an alternate grease
removal device shall contain the following information:
         a.   Location of sewer main and easement to proposed location outside
building.
         b.   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for
all services at that site.
      2.   Alternative pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to:
devices that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and
prevent it from being discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system. All
alternative pretreatment technology must be appropriately sized and approved by
the Public Works Director or designee.

minimum of two (2) compartments with fittings designed for grease retention.
   C.   Location: Grease interceptors shall be installed at a location where it
shall be easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal of grease. The
grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of the building where food
is handled. Location of the grease interceptor must meet the approval of the
Public Works Director or designee.
   D.   Maintenance; Inspection: All such grease interceptors shall be serviced
and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain
minimum design capability or effective volume to intercept and retain greases.
These devices should be inspected at least monthly. Users who are required to
maintain a grease interceptor shall:
      1.   Provide a minimum hydraulic retention time in accordance with the
manufacturer and the current edition of the Illinois State Plumbing Code.
      2.   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required.
Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials, such as
grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags,
etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective
volume of the device.
   E.   Records: The user shall maintain a written record of inspection and
maintenance for a minimum of three (3) years. All such records shall be
submitted to the Director of Public Works or designee on an annual basis.
   F.   Sanitary Wastewater Prohibited: Sanitary wastewater is not allowed to
be connected to sewer lines intended for grease interceptor service.
   G.   Manholes: Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of twenty four
inches (24"), shall be provided over each grease interceptor chamber and
sanitary tee. Access to manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be

trap complying with the provisions of this section must be installed in the
waste line leading from sinks, drains and other fixtures or equipment in food
service establishments where grease may be introduced into the drainage or
sewage system in quantities that can affect line blockage or hinder sewage
treatment or private sewage disposal.
   B.   Conformance To Plumbing Code: Grease trap sizing and installation shall
conform to the current Illinois State Plumbing Code.
   C.   Maintenance: Grease traps shall be maintained in efficient operating
conditions by regular removal of the accumulated grease. No such collected
material shall be introduced into any drainage piping or public or private
sewer.
   D.   Prohibited Connections: No food waste disposal unit or dishwasher shall
be connected to or discharged into any grease trap.
   E.   Wastewater: Wastewater in excess of one hundred forty degrees

(1987 Code § 26-159)
9-4E-6: ENFORCEMENT:
Except as provided herein, grease interceptors/traps will be required, however,
no enforcement actions will be taken under this article for failure to achieve
limits on grease discharges from the facility. If, during this one year period,
an obstruction of a sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the
extent which adversely impacts the environment and said overflow or failure of
the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part
or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s), the City will
pursue enforcement action.
(1987 Code § 26-160; amd. 2019 Code)
9-4E-7: VIOLATION:
If a food service establishment is found to be responsible for excessive grease
accumulation in the sanitary sewer main resulting in reduced flow, backup,
complete blockage and/or flow aboveground, the property owner where said
generator is located shall be subject to any or all of the fines listed in
settlement of offenses as outlined in section 1-4A-2 of this Code; and any/all
costs incurred by the City for removing the accumulation or blockage; any and
all cleanup costs and; may include possible termination of service.

      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A
person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person
denies the City reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of
conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.
      7.   If the City has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the City may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court
of competent jurisdiction.
(1987 Code § 26-171)
9-5B-10: REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
The City will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for any
activity, operation or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or
contamination of stormwater, the MS4 or waters of the U.S. The owner or
operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these
structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to
the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this
section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan
(SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(1987 Code § 26-172)
9-5B-11: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(1987 Code § 26-173)
9-5B-12: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the MS4 or water of the U.S., said person shall
take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of
such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the City in person or by phone or facsimile
no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall
be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the City within three
(3) business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years.
(1987 Code § 26-174)
9-5B-13: ENFORCEMENT:

(1987 Code § 7-216; amd. Ord. 19-1186, 2-18-2019)
10-12-2: SCOPE:
This chapter shall apply to all solar collectors and all component parts of a
solar system using solar collectors, installed in the City. Solar energy
engines are also regulated by this chapter, whenever such an engine or any part
of such engine is mounted on a roof. This chapter shall cover not only solar
collectors on new buildings being constructed but also solar collectors on
existing buildings. No such solar collector shall be installed without
complying with the terms of this chapter.
(1987 Code § 7-217)
10-12-3: PERMIT REQUIRED:
No solar collector or solar engine shall be installed or constructed without a
permit having been issued for the solar collector. Applications shall be
accompanied by drawings or blueprints showing the locations and clearances from
the roof of all existing and proposed solar collectors, ducts, pipes, controls
and other components, including those parts of the system to be installed on
the roof or above the roof and those parts of the system to be installed
elsewhere in the building. Methods for installing pipes through the roof shall
be indicated. The slope of the roof shall be indicated. The application shall
be accompanied by specifications for any manufactured components to be
installed and shall contain a complete description of any components to be
fabricated on or off the site for the installation.
(1987 Code § 7-218)
10-12-4: LOCATION; HEIGHT AND SETBACK:
All solar collectors shall be installed either on the roof of the main building
or shall be otherwise incorporated into and made an integral part of the main
building itself. The maximum height and setback regulations of the City Zoning
Ordinance shall be observed.
(1987 Code § 7-219)
10-12-5: MINIMUM ROOF SLOPE:
No solar collector, solar engine or accessories, pipes or ducts for any solar
collector or solar engine shall be installed on any roof having a slope of less
than two percent (<2%) (1/4 of an inch per foot or 2 centimeters per meter).
(1987 Code § 7-220)
10-12-6: LOW SLOPED ROOF INSTALLATION:
Installations on low sloped roofs shall comply with the following requirements:
   A.   Clearances: All collectors, reflectors, engines, pipes, ducts and other
components shall have sufficient clearance between the roof and the
installation to permit roof repairs to be made and to permit circulation of air
to avoid constant dampness, considering the configuration and location of the
solar components and the roof. A space of two feet (2') or sixty one
centimeters (61 cm) shall be adequate clearance in all instances; provided,
that a smaller space shall be permitted if it can be demonstrated that all
normal repairs and resurfacings of the roof may be made under the proposed
clearances. The clearances required herein shall not apply to vertical pipes
installed through the roof surface or installed outside of the outside walls to
provide access to solar components.
   B.   Load Capacity: No solar component shall be installed on any roof unless
the roof has sufficient capacity to hold the weight of the roof, the weight of
the solar components and the anticipated snow load. The weight of fluid to be
used in any panels, pipes or other components will be included in the
calculations of load. In determining the anticipated snow load, the effect of
the solar components on causing drifting shall be considered. If the rated
capacity of the roof structure is at least one and one-half (11/2) times the
weight of the roof components, the solar components and the anticipated snow
load, the roof structure shall be deemed to have sufficient load capacity.
   C.   Protection From Drifting Or Sliding Snow: On any installation where
solar collectors, solar engines and reflectors may cause snow to drift on a
roof, provisions shall be made by snow fences, chutes or other barriers to
prevent snowdrifts from accumulating on the roof. Wherever a solar collector,
or other solar component may cause snow to slide, the part of the roof where
the snow may accumulate as a result of sliding shall have sufficient capacity
to hold the weight of the snow anticipated to accumulate because of sliding.
Wherever the location and slope of a solar collector or other solar component
may cause snow to slide onto any doorway, sidewalk or other place used by
pedestrian traffic, protection in the form of chutes, awnings or other devices
shall be provided to prevent any snow from sliding onto any such doorway,
sidewalk or other place.
   D.   Roof Penetration: Wherever any pipe, duct or other solar component
penetrates the surface of a roof, the roof shall be protected from leaks in the
manner provided for any stack, pipe or conduit penetrating the roof surface.
   E.   Roof Preparation: Before any solar component is installed, the roof
shall be inspected and any repairs and maintenance work needed shall be done to
put the roof in leakproof condition.
(1987 Code § 7-221)
10-12-7: OTHER THAN LOW SLOPED ROOF INSTALLATION:
All of the requirements for installations on low sloped roofs shall apply to
installations on roofs other than low sloped roofs, except that in lieu of
clearance from the roof, a solar panel may be attached flush to the roof. Such
solar panel may be an integral part of the roof, providing a waterproof cover,
with a waterproof seal between the panel and the rest of the roof. If such
panel is not made an integral part of the roof but is attached flush with the
roof, the top and sides of the panel shall be sealed where they meet the roof
surface or shingles, to prevent water from getting under the panel.
(1987 Code § 7-222)
10-12-8: ACCESS:
Any roof over three (3) stories above the ground shall be provided with a means
of access other than an outside ladder against an outside wall. No solar
components shall be installed in a location so as to interfere with walkways on
any roof.
(1987 Code § 7-223)
10-12-9: LEAKPROOF COMPONENTS:
Each solar component which may contain any liquid or gas shall be designed and
constructed to prevent the leakage of any liquid or gas under any combination
of temperature and pressure possible either during use or when the system is
not in use.
(1987 Code § 7-224)
10-12-10: WIND PRESSURE:
Each solar collector, solar panel and solar engine shall be securely anchored
to withstand the maximum wind pressure anticipated, considering the effects, if
any, of the solar components in channeling wind, and without considering the
weight of any liquid in the components.
(1987 Code § 7-225)
10-12-11: INNOVATIVE DESIGNS:
Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as prohibiting any innovative
design. Any design not specifically permitted by this chapter may be installed,
upon a showing that the proposed system of solar components will achieve the
safety objectives and structural objectives of the provisions of this chapter.
(1987 Code § 7-227)
10-12-12: INSPECTIONS, REPAIRS:
Each solar collector, reflector, solar engine and all solar components shall be
inspected at least once each year. Such inspections shall be at the owner’s
expense, and may be made by any qualified person selected by the owner. The
inspection shall include looking for any evidence of dampness on the roof due
to shading, lack of air circulation or leaks, and shall include examining the
structural parts securing all components. A certified report of such inspection
shall be filed annually by, or on behalf of, the owner/applicant with the
Building Officer on or before March 1 of each year.
(1987 Code § 7-226)
10-12-13: INTERFERENCE WITH ADJOINING PROPERTY:

      1.   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
      2.   A statement that the Chief of Police has information that the
property may be a chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the
nuisance activities that may exist, or that have occurred. The Chief of Police
shall offer the person in charge an opportunity to propose a course of action

within ten (10) days to discuss the nuisance activities.

shown in the McHenry County tax records for the property, and/or the occupant
at the address of the property, if these persons are different than the person
in charge and shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage

(10) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the person
in charge, and the person in charge has not contacted the Chief of Police.
      5.   The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may be
a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
proceedings under this chapter.
      6.   If after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal
proceedings by the City pursuant to this chapter, a person in charge stipulates
with the Chief of Police that the person in charge will pursue a course of
action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the
violation, the Chief of Police may agree to postpone legal proceedings for a
period of not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days, except in
the case of a nuisance activity where a search warrant was executed at the
property. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of
the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within

nuisance.

Chief of Police shall maintain copies of the notice, as well as any other
documentation, which supports legal proceedings.
   C.   Admission; Evidence: When a person in charge makes a response to the
Chief of Police as required above, any conduct or statements made in connection

nuisance activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the
exclusion of any evidence that is otherwise admissible or offered for any other
purpose.

nuisance property, the City shall have the initial burden of showing the
preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   B.   Defense To Action: It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of
chronic nuisance property that the owner of the property at the time in
question could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine
that the property had become a public nuisance property, or could not, in spite
of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading
to the finding that the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   C.   Considerations In Imposing Civil Penalty: In establishing the amount of
any civil penalty requested, the Administrative Law Judge may consider any of
the following factors if they need to be found appropriate, and shall cite
those found applicable:

mitigate or correct the problem at the property.

   A.   Interim Relief: In the event that it is determined that the property is
an immediate threat to the public safety and welfare, the City may apply to the
Administrative Law Judge for such interim relief as is deemed by the Chief of
Police to be appropriate. In such an event, the notification provision set
forth in section
10-18-5 of this chapter need not be complied with; however, the City shall make
a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a hearing before the
Administrative Law Judge.
   B.   Order; Civil Fine: In the event the Administrative Law Judge finds that
the property constitutes a “chronic nuisance property”, as defined in section
10-18-2 of this chapter, the Administrative Law Judge may order the remedy set
out above. In addition, in the event that he also finds the person in charge
had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting or
violating this article and permitted the activities to occur, the
Administrative Law Judge may assess a civil fine as provided in this article.
   C.   Security Property: The Administrative Law Judge may authorize the City
to physically secure the property against use or occupancy in the event that
the owner fails to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event
the City is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by
the City to affect a closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the
property. If used herein, “costs” mean the costs actually incurred by the City
for the physical securing of the property.
   D.   Statement Of Costs; Lien: The City shall prepare a statement of cost
and thereafter submit said statement to the court of its review. If no
objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a
lien in said amount may be recorded against said property.
   E.   Liability For Payment: Any person who is assessed the cost of closure
and/or civil penalty by the Administrative Law Judge shall be personally liable
for the payment thereof by the City.
   F.   Relocation Costs Of Tenant: A tenant is entitled to their reasonable
relocation costs, as those are determined by the court if without actual
notice, the tenant moved in the property, after either:
      1.   The owner or tenant received notice as described herein of the Chief
of Police’s determination as described above.
      2.   Unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought
pursuant to this section.
      3.   Any person who is assessed with costs of closure and/or civil
penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the
City.

(1987 Code § 18.50-1)
10-21-2: PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES:
It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation
caused by development activities, including clearing, grading, stripping,
excavating and filling of land in the City. Measures taken to control soil
erosion and off site sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment
is not transported from the site by a storm event of 10-year frequency or less.
The following principles shall apply to all development activities within the
City and to the preparation of the submissions required under this chapter:
   A.   Erosion Control: Development should be related to the topography and
soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of
steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided
wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as closely as
possible.
   B.   Natural Vegetation And Sources: Natural vegetation should be retained
and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural
watercourses, lakes, ponds and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever
possible. Temporary crossings, when permitted, must include appropriate
stabilization measures.
   C.   Damage Prevention: Special precautions should be taken to prevent
damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to
any stream, lake, pond or wetland. Preventive measures should reflect the
sensitivity of the areas to erosion and sedimentation.
   D.   Minimum Land Exposure: The smallest practical area of land should be
exposed for the shortest practical time during development.
   E.   Sediment, Runoff Control Measures: Sediment basins or traps, filter
barriers, diversions, and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control
measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained
to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development.
   F.   Assessment Of Control Measures: The selection of erosion and
sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable
frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on
evaluation of the risks, costs and benefits involved.
   G.   Consideration Of Aesthetics And Maintenance: In the design of erosion
control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing
maintenance should be considered.
   H.   Accommodation Of Increased Runoff: Provision should be made to
accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions
during and after development. Drainageways should be designed so that their
final gradients and the resultant velocities of discharges will not create
additional erosion.
   I.   Installation Of Vegetation, Structures: Permanent vegetation and
structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during
development.
   J.   Protective Vegetative Cover: Those areas being converted from
agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an
appropriate protective cover prior to development.
   K.   Waste Disposal: All waste generated as a result of site development
activity should be properly disposed of and should be prevented from being
carried off the site by either wind or water.
   L.   Prevention Of Sediment Onto Roadway: All construction sites should
provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto roadways.
(1987 Code § 18.50-2)
10-21-3: SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIRED:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall commence or
perform any clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or filling of land which
meets the following provisions without having first obtained a site development
permit from the Director of Public Works:
   A.   Land Disturbing Activity: Any land disturbing activity that will affect
an area in excess of five thousand (5,000) square feet; or
   B.   Activity Affecting Waterways: Any land disturbing activity that will
affect an area in excess of five hundred (500) square feet if the activity is
within twenty five feet (25') of a lake, pond, stream or wetland; or
   C.   Excavation, Fill: Excavation or fill, or any combination thereof, that
will exceed one hundred (100) cubic yards.
(1987 Code § 18.50-3)
10-21-4: EXCEPTIONS TO PERMIT REQUIREMENT:
Although prior written notification of any site work shall be given to the
Director of Public Works by any person performing site work, a permit shall not
be required for any of the following:
   A.   Development Less Than One Acre: Development of a site of one acre or
less for residential use, or of one acre or less for commercial or industrial
use; provided, that the person responsible for any such development shall
implement necessary soil erosion and sediment control measures to satisfy the
principles set forth in this chapter;
   B.   Single-Family Residence: Excavation below final grade for the
foundation of a single-family residence and appurtenant structures on a site
one acre or less for which a building permit has been issued by the City;
provided, that the person responsible for any such development shall implement
necessary soil erosion and sediment control measures to satisfy the principles
set forth in this chapter;
   C.   Agricultural Use: Agricultural use of land;
   D.   Septic System For Existing: Installation, renovation or replacement of
a septic system to serve an existing dwelling or structure.

      1.   For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers
(including filter fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures) shall be
constructed to control all off site runoff as specified in the referenced
handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty five feet
(25'), may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is
expected.
      2.   For disturbed areas draining more than one but less than five (5)
acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at
the downslope point of the disturbed area.
      3.   For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment
basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point
of the disturbed area.
      4.   Sediment basin and sediment trap designs shall provide for both
detention storage and sediment storage and shall be composed of equal volumes
of “wet” detention storage and “dry” detention storage and each shall be sized
for the 2-year, 24-hour runoff from the site under maximum runoff conditions
during construction. The release rate of the basin shall be that rate required
to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten (10) hours. The elevation of
the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention
storage.
      5.   The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment
load generated from the site over the duration of the construction period with
a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in one year.
For construction periods exceeding one year, the 1-year sediment load and a
sediment removal schedule may be substituted.
   B.   Stormwater: Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales
and diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes, shall be designed
and constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the 10-year
frequency storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be
stabilized within forty eight (48) hours, consistent with the following
standards:
      1.   For grades up to four percent (4%), seeding in combination with
mulch, erosion blanket, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod
or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel.
      2.   For grades of four percent (4%) to eight percent (8%), permanent
ditch checks and sod, or an equivalent control measure, shall be applied in the
channel.
      3.   For grades greater than eight percent (8%), rock, riprap or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively
reduced using drop structures.
   C.   Stabilization Of Disturbed Areas: Disturbed areas shall be stabilized
with temporary or permanent measures within seven (7) calendar days following
the end of active disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following
criteria:
      1.   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding and/or nonvegetative measures.
      2.   Areas having slopes greater than twelve percent (12%) shall be
stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or equivalent.
   D.   Land Disturbance Activities: Land disturbance activities in stream
channels shall be avoided, where possible. If disturbance activities are
unavoidable, the following requirements shall be met:
      1.   Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the
maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary,
temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material, such as riprap
or gravel.
      2.   The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to
a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized
within forty eight (48) hours after channel disturbance is completed,
interrupted or stopped.
      3.   Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be
constructed and fully stabilized before flow is diverted.
   E.   Storm Sewer Protection: Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be
protected by sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design
standards and specifications.
   F.   Soil Storage Piles: Soil storage piles containing more than ten (10)
cubic yards of material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length
of less than twenty five feet (25') to a roadway or drainage channel. Filter
barriers, including straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be
installed immediately on the downslope side of the piles.
   G.   Dewatering Devices: If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations
shall be protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through
appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent.
   H.   Roadway Protection: Each site shall have a graveled (or equivalent)
entrance road, access drive and parking area of sufficient length and width to
prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any
sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or
street cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported
to a controlled sediment disposal area.
   I.   Maintenance Of Erosion And Sediment Control: All temporary and
permanent erosion and sediment control practices must be maintained and
repaired as needed to assure effective performance of their intended function.
   J.   Disposal Of Temporary Erosion And Sediment Control: All temporary
erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within thirty (30)
days after final site stabilization is achieved with permanent soil
stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soils resulting
from the disposition of temporary measures should be permanently stabilized to
prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
(1987 Code § 18.50-12)
10-21-14: MAINTENANCE OF CONTROL MEASURES:
All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter shall be maintained periodically by the applicant
or subsequent landowner during the period of land disturbance and development
of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance.

the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved.
Plans for grading, stripping, excavating and filling work bearing the signature
of the Director of the Community Development Department shall be maintained at
the site during progress of the work. The permittee shall give notice and
request inspection at the completion of each of the work stages in the plan,
including: installation of sediment and runoff control measures prior to other
earth disturbance or grading; after stripping and clearing: after rough
grading; after final grading; after seeding and landscaping; after final
stabilization and landscaping; prior to removal of sediment controls.

10-21-16: SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS:
   A.   When Required: If at any stage of the grading of any development site
the Director of the Community Development Department determines by inspection
that the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing
permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland,
watercourse or drainage structure, the Director of the Community Development
Department may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that
such reasonable special precautions be taken as is considered advisable to
avoid the likelihood of such peril. “Special precautions” may include, but
shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control, and the recommendations of the City
Engineer.
   B.   Temporary Structures For Protection: Where it appears that storm damage
may result because the grading on any development site is not complete, work
may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures or
take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or
the public safety. On large developments or where unusual site conditions
prevail, the Director of the Community Development Department may specify the
time of starting grading and time of completion, or may require that the
operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of
protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.

appearance of the real estate, including landscaping;
         e.   Owner’s name;
         f.   An application fee established by the City Council to cover the
cost of the review process.
      3.   Consideration By Commission: The commission shall consider the
completed application at its next regular meeting. The commission shall act
promptly and in a reasonable manner in its judgment of plans for construction,
alteration, removal or demolition of structures in preservation districts that
have little historic value and that are not shown on priority lists, except
where such construction, alteration or demolition would seriously impair the
historic or architectural value of surrounding structures or the surrounding
area.
      4.   Design Criteria: The commission shall consider the following factors
in reviewing applications for Certificates of Appropriateness:
         a.   Height: Compatible with the style and character of the landmark
and with the surrounding structures within a preservation district;
         b.   Proportions Of Windows And Doors: Compatible with the
architectural style and character of the landmark and with the surrounding
structures within a preservation district;
         c.   Relationship Of Building Masses And Spaces: Compatible within a
preservation district to open space between it and adjoining structures;
         d.   Roof Shape: Compatible with the architectural style and character
of the landmark and surrounding structures in a preservation district;
         e.   Landscaping: Compatible with the architectural style and
character of the landmark and with the surrounding structures within a
preservation district;
         f.   Scale: Compatible with architectural style and character of the
landmark and with the surrounding structures within a preservation district;
         g.   Directional Expression: Compatible with the dominant horizontal
or vertical expression of surrounding structures and facades;
         h.   Architectural Details: Treated to make a landmark compatible with
its original architectural style or character.
      5.   Standards For Review: The commission, in considering the
appropriateness of any alteration, demolition, construction, or removal shall
be guided by the following general standards in addition to any design
guidelines in the ordinance designating the landmark or preservation district:
         a.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property that requires minimal alteration of the structure, or site and
its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose;
         b.   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure
or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration
of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should be avoided
when possible;
         c.   All structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their
time. Alterations which have no historical basis and which seek to create an
earlier appearance shall be discouraged;
         d.   Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a structure or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right,
and this significance shall be recognized and respected;
         e.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship that characterize a structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity;
         f.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. If replacement is necessary, the new material
should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture
and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural
features should be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated by
historic, physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or
the availability of different architectural elements from other structures;

gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken;
         h.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project;
         i.   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment;
         j.   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done so that the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the
future.
      6.   Determination By Commission: The commission shall provide City
Council with a recommendation of the approval or denial of the Certificate of
Appropriateness supported by written findings.
      7.   Denial Of Certificate Of Appropriateness: A recommendation of denial
of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be accompanied by a statement of the
reasons for the denial. The commission shall make recommendations to the City
concerning changes, if any, in the proposed action that would cause the
commission to reconsider its denial. The applicant may submit an amended
application or reapply for a building permit that takes into consideration the
recommendations of the commission.
      8.   Failure Of Commission To Review Application In Timely Manner:
Failure of the commission to make a recommendation to City Council regarding
the final determination on an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness
within ninety (90) days from receipt of a completed application shall
constitute approval and no other evidence shall be needed.
      9.   Demolitions: Upon receipt of an application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness for demolition, the commission shall make a recommendation to
City Council regarding its determination, supported by written findings,
whether one or more of the following criteria are met:

reasonably meet national, State or local criteria for designation as a historic
or architectural landmark on its own credentials;
         b.   The structure is of such unusual or uncommon design, texture or
materials that it could not be reproduced, or be reproduced only with great
difficulty and expense;
         c.   Retention of the structure would aid substantially in preserving
and protecting another structure that meets the above criteria.
      10.   Compliance: A Certificate of Appropriateness will become void if
there is any change in the scope of work of the approved application subsequent
to the issuance of the certificate; if twelve (12) months have elapsed after
the issuance of the certificate and no building permit has been issued; or if
twenty four (24) months have lapsed after issuance of the last building permit
and the project has not been completed.
      11.   Appeals: Any appeal of a denial of Certificate of Appropriateness
shall be made to the City Council. The City Council, after reviewing the
recommendation and written findings of the commission, shall affirm the
recommendation or approve the Certificate of Appropriateness within sixty (60)
days from receipt of the appeal.
   C.   Certificate Of Economic Hardship:
      1.   Determination For Issuance: The City shall issue a Certificate of
Economic Hardship only after a determination that the failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness has denied, or will deny the owner of a landmark
or of a property within a preservation district all reasonable use of, or

   C.   Where a district boundary divides a lot in single ownership, the
district governing any portion of the lot may, at the owner’s discretion,
extend to the entire lot if such extension is not more than twenty five feet

outside storage where these uses are permitted, with the exception of outdoor
retail displays and outdoor seating in compliance with the following
conditions:
(Ord. 15-1113)
   A.   Display Of Merchandise: The intent of this section is to provide
appropriate locations for the outdoor display of merchandise and to mitigate
any adverse impacts on adjacent properties and public right-of-way while
maintaining public health, safety and welfare. Any person who owns or operates
a retail business that has a storefront that opens directly onto a street,
public way or private way, shall be permitted to display products which are
part of the regular inventory of the business. This includes, but is not
limited to, vending machines, Red Box kiosks, propane cylinder displays, etc.,
that are wholly contained, ancillary to the business and kept outside at all
times. The display shall be limited to the area directly in front of such
business, provided:
      1.   A permit is obtained from the Community Development Department,
prior to the display of product.
      2.   Outside display is limited to properties that are permitted to have
retail sales as listed in this title, and (retail) legal nonconforming
properties in existence prior to the date of the ordinance codified herein,
only.
      3.   Display is only permitted during hours the business is open and
accessible to the public. At all other times the product shall be stored inside
the building.
      4.   Approved ingress and egress to and from a building must be
maintained as required by the City’s currently adopted Building Code.
      5.   Public and private sidewalks shall not be reduced to a clear usable
width of less than forty eight inches (48").
      6.   A minimum of four feet (4') of horizontal clearance must be
maintained between any display and trees, landscaping, utility poles, sign
poles, fire hydrants, shelters and other similar devices or structures.
      7.   Display shall not be permitted to be placed in parking stalls, drive
aisles, alleys, streets or roads.
      8.   Pedestrian and motor vehicle vision clearance must not be blocked at
intersections, driveways, doors and signage. Note: Product being displayed is
not permitted to be located within two feet (2') of the latch side of any door.
      9.   Alcoholic beverages, tobacco, firearms, munitions, adult oriented
items, or any other article or product that a minor (as defined by Federal,
State or local ordinance) is prohibited from purchasing by law, shall not be
permitted outside the building.
      10.   McHenry County Health Department approval must be obtained prior to
placing anything that can be eaten, consumed or ingested, outside the building.
      11.   The use of signage, pennants, banners, flags (other than American),
lighting, electric amplification or noisemaking devices shall not be used to
attract attention to the display.
      12.   The display is placed on an approved surface, such as concrete,
asphalt or paver bricks.
      13.   The display will not be permitted to be anchored or secured to the
ground, trees, signs, fire hydrants or buildings.
      14.   All products shall be kept flush or parallel, with the face of the
building where the retail business is located and in no case shall the area
used for the display exceed the following dimensions:
         a.   Twenty percent (20%) of the width of the business frontage of the
building as defined in this title.
         b.   Exceed six feet (6') in height measured from the sidewalk
surface.
         c.   Be placed more than six feet (6') from the face of the building.
      15.   All sales and transfer of product shall take place inside the
building where normal retail transactions occur.
      16.   Outside display shall only be allowed when weather conditions are
favorable for this use.
      17.   The display shall be kept neat and orderly and remain free from
trash and debris at all times.
      18.   The display shall be immediately removed by the business owner any
time the City Administrator or his designee, determines a clear sidewalk is
needed because of traffic, street cleaning, maintenance, utility work, crowd
control, parade, emergency or violation of any of the above listed conditions.
(Ord. 12-1059)
   B.   Outdoor Seating:
      1.   Application form for an outdoor seating permit shall be submitted
which identifies business name, address, PIN, zoning designation, name,
address, phone, fax, e-mail of applicant and property owner.
      2.   A dimensioned site plan indicating the number and location of the
tables (including table measurements), chairs, trash receptacles and any other

11-10F-6: Expanded Site Plan Review Procedure
11-10F-7: Criteria For Review
11-10F-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
   A.   The purpose of the Downtown Overlay District (DOD) is to preserve and
protect the existing historical character of the downtown area, promote the
transformation of the downtown into an even more compact pedestrian, transit
oriented mixed use area, and promote the downtown area as an economically
viable part of the City. The DOD seeks to assist in the growth of existing
businesses, enhance the character of their buildings and facades, and provide
guidance for those exterior alterations and encourage new infill development.
The DOD also seeks to provide a mechanism to complement the development of the
City’s proposed McHenry Riverwalk. The primary goals of the DOD Ordinance are
as follows:
      1.   Enhance the economic viability of the downtown area and foster
reinvestment and economic development;
      2.   Promote a pedestrian oriented twenty four (24) hour Downtown
District;
      3.   Encourage, where practical, the adaptive reuse of downtown buildings
and structures;
      4.   Plan for new commercial, residential and mixed use infill
development that is compatible to the character and function of the downtown;
      5.   Encourage the use of appropriate building materials and facades so
as to enhance the character and continuity of the downtown areas;
      6.   Provide an avenue whereby downtown businesses can benefit and
enhance their business from the construction of the McHenry Riverwalk;
      7.   Continue to maintain the historical fabric of the downtown area;
      8.   Provide a mechanism for additional signage along the McHenry
Riverwalk, in the rear of the downtown businesses;
      9.   Further the goals of the City of McHenry Downtown Plan and Downtown
District Design Guidelines.
   B.   In order to accomplish these goals, the City recognizes that new
development, redevelopment and building modifications within the boundaries of
the DOD is more likely to require relief from strict compliance with this
title. Instead of using the traditional zoning and variance processes to
consider this relief, the DOD provides a mechanism, the site plan review
process, for allowing flexibility from the requirements of this title. Through
the site plan review process, development proposals in the DOD can be reviewed
on a more comprehensive level to ensure the goals and objectives of the
district are met.

CHAPTER 11: INTEGRATED DESIGN DISTRICT
Section
11-11-1: Purpose
11-11-2: General Standards
11-11-3: Standards For Development
11-11-4: Review Procedure
11-11-5: Approval Criteria For Development Review
11-11-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of the Integrated Design District (IDD) is to encourage
innovative design in the development of land by providing relief from rigid
zoning and subdivision standards, which are designed for conventional
developments and may inhibit creative land planning. In order to receive such
relief, a development must incorporate innovative design techniques that
protect and enhance the City’s natural and manmade resources, such as streams
and watercourses, wetlands, native vegetation, groundwater recharge areas,
mature tree stands, view sheds, historical character and the like. The IDD
requires that a site’s unique environmental features, which may be removed or
otherwise altered in the course of traditional land development, be integrated
into the overall design of a project, and protected through the use of
covenants and long term maintenance agreements. The IDD also encourages
multiple land uses where appropriate, as part of a unified development strategy
to reduce impervious surfaces and reduce the dependency on the automobile.
   B.   Ideally, no two (2) IDD developments will be identical. Through the use
of nonconventional design techniques, such as build to lines, clustering, land
conservation strategies, varied building placements, boulevards, one-way
streets and alleys, a specific development receives its own use, lot size,
bulk, parking, landscaping and design standards.
(Ord. 96-647; amd. Ord. 05-866)
11-11-2: GENERAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Applicability: The IDD is intended for properties designated as IDD on
the City of McHenry Comprehensive Future Land Use Map. This does not, however,
preclude other properties within or annexed to the City as being developed
under the provisions of this district.
   B.   Compliance: Any property developed under the provisions of this chapter
must adhere to the purpose and intent of the district, and comply with the
criteria for development and review procedures.
   C.   Ownership: Properties to be developed under the provisions of this
district shall be under unified ownership or control.
   D.   Conditional Use Permit: Properties to be developed under the provisions
of this district are required to obtain a conditional use permit and shall
follow the conditional use permit process.
   E.   No Minimum Acreage: There is no minimum acreage to develop property
under the provisions of this chapter.
   F.   Zoning Designation: There is no underlying zoning designation
associated with properties developed in accordance with the provisions of this
district. IDD will serve as the zoning designation for the property being
developed. Zoning, subdivision and other development standards for the property
shall be set forth in an ordinance passed by the City Council, and may vary
from the requirements of City ordinances.
   G.   Variances:
      1.   Each variance or deviation from City ordinances shall be evaluated
independently and based on the benefit(s) associated with the development,
related to, but not limited to, the following: physical condition(s) of the
property, proposed variance results in a cohesive, high quality development,
that any reduction(s) from minimum requirements are offset by sufficiently
exceeding other requirements of this title, which result in a greater benefit
to the community or future residents of the property being developed.
      2.   Subsequent to approval of an IDD Ordinance and associated plan,
additional variance requests are discouraged and the burden will be placed on
the applicant to substantiate a hardship created, in accordance with the
variance standards stated herein.
   H.   Management Plan: A Comprehensive Management Plan is required to govern
the long term management of natural areas, open areas, placement of accessory
structures on lots and other issues associated with “typical” subdivision
covenants, conditions and restrictions of a property.
(Ord. 96-647; amd. Ord. 05-866)
11-11-3: STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   In order to receive an IDD designation, a development must incorporate
one or more of the following design techniques:
      1.   Varied housing styles, in a cluster style, with varied elevations,
such as, but not limited to: Prairie, Traditional, Italianate, Victorian, row
houses;
      2.   Appropriate building materials;
      3.   Development of community centers and traditional town centers;
      4.   Varied lot layouts, including cluster housing design, with side and
rear loaded garages;
      5.   Varied house placement on lots;
      6.   Detached garages;
      7.   Build to lines;
      8.   Individual lot landscaping plans;
      9.   Neighborhood signage;
      10.   Commercial design guidelines;
      11.   Anti-monotony guidelines;
      12.   Boulevard entrance signage and associated landscaping;
      13.   Landscaping for environmental corridors, dominant with natural
prairie plantings;
      14.   Establishment of conservation easements for long term management
over high quality natural areas;
      15.   Decorative streetlighting;
      16.   Berming and landscaping proposed along major roadways;
      17.   Streetscape enhancements;
      18.   Vegetative swales;
      19.   Pedestrian path system;
      20.   Minimization of impervious surface area;
      21.   Permeable pavement where appropriate;
      22.   Preservation and enhancement of natural features;
      23.   Citywide benefits;
      24.   Economic benefits; and
      25.   Quality of life benefits, including, but not limited to:
recreational benefits to community, enhanced view sheds, street and pedestrian
connectivity to surrounding properties, preservation of large natural areas,
etc.

If no action is taken by the applicant within said forty five (45) day period,
a concept plan shall be considered withdrawn.
   C.   Application For Public Hearing Before Planning And Zoning Commission:
After receiving comments by the Committee of the Whole about the IDD concept
plan, the applicant shall apply for a public hearing before the Planning and
Zoning Commission, using the same procedures and notification requirements as
for a conditional use permit, except as modified herein.
      1.   Preliminary Plat And Preliminary Engineering: Because the design of
an IDD typically incorporates conservation features and nontraditional
engineering measures to accommodate stormwater management, a preliminary plat
and preliminary engineering plans must be approved by the City before a public
hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         a.   Five (5) copies of a preliminary plat and preliminary engineering
plans, in accordance with the City’s Subdivision Control and Development
Ordinance and Technical Review Standards, shall be submitted for technical
engineering review.
         b.   A retained personnel fee of one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500.00) shall be submitted to cover the review costs of plans and studies,
and any other information necessary to perform a complete analysis of the
project, which may completed by outside consultants.
         c.   Plans will be reviewed for compliance with the requirements for
preliminary plats and preliminary engineering as set forth in the Subdivision
Control and Development Ordinance and Technical Specifications Manual.
         d.   An analysis of all variances from City ordinances that are being
sought shall be performed, including, but not limited to, design and layout,
lot size, layout, block length, configuration, cul-de- sacs, lot widths, etc.
(i.e., all of the conventional subdivision design standards and restrictions).
         e.   Once all preliminary platting and engineering issues are
addressed to the satisfaction of the City, a public hearing before the Planning
and Zoning Commission will be scheduled.
      2.   Public Hearing Before Planning And Zoning Commission: Upon approval
of a preliminary plat and preliminary engineering, a public hearing before the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall be scheduled. Twenty five (25) copies of
the following documentation shall be submitted within thirty (30) days of
approval of a preliminary plat and preliminary engineering:
         a.   A narrative description of the overall development, demonstrating
the appropriate purpose and intent of development and how provisions of this
chapter have been met, including criteria listed in section
11-11-5, “Approval Criteria For Development Review”, of this chapter.
         b.   A preliminary plan including the following information: acreage
of property, adjacent land uses, site features, including topography, drainage
patterns, proposed street layout, table listing average lot size, proposed land
uses and associated acreages, density, setbacks, bulk standards, floor area
ratio for nonresidential land uses, and a statement of ownership and management
of property.
         c.   The preliminary plat of subdivision approved by the City staff.
         d.   A description of all variances to City ordinances being
requested, as well as justification for each variance requested.
         e.   A draft development management plan for the property detailing:
long term maintenance and funding of open space and natural areas,
establishment of conservation easements over natural areas, location of
accessory structures, establishment of a development wide board or association,
etc.
         f.   Any other information required by City staff, including, but not
limited to, the following: revised traffic study, school impact analysis and/or
fiscal impact analysis, including impact on City services and financial
benefits to the City, typical building elevations, site landscaping plans, etc.
      3.   Findings Of Fact: The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold the
public hearing on the proposed IDD development. The commission may call any
additional witness and/or receive independent testimony, as it deems necessary,
and may continue said hearing from time to time in order to explore all
outstanding questions and to achieve thorough findings of fact. After the
hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall transmit to the City Council
written findings of fact, based on section
11-11-5, “Approval Criteria For Development Review”, of this chapter, and
recommend to the City Council approval, approval with modifications or denial
of the application.
   D.   Drafting Of IDD Ordinance:
      1.   If a positive recommendation is made by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, staff will work with the applicant in formulating a draft IDD
Ordinance for the property. Using the existing preliminary plan and plat, as
well as the City’s Zoning Ordinance as a guide, an IDD Ordinance will be
drafted to address all zoning issues, as well as each variance that is
requested. Each IDD Ordinance will reference a specific preliminary plat,
management plan for the property, and any other documents deemed necessary by
City staff or required by the City Council. Also, at this time, a final
Comprehensive Management Plan shall be submitted and approved by staff prior to
City Council consideration. This plan shall dictate the long term management of
all common areas, funding sources that will be used, items typically listed in
covenants, conditions and restrictions and other items as required by staff.
Staff may consult, at their discretion and at the applicant’s expense, any
outside consultant or agency in order to ensure the establishment of a proper
and functional working document for the development of an IDD property.
      2.   If the property is proposed to be annexed to the City, a draft
annexation agreement will also be prepared at this time and a public hearing
for said annexation agreement before the City Council shall be scheduled.
   E.   City Council Consideration Of Preliminary Plan And Plat: After
receiving findings of fact from the Planning and Zoning Commission, the draft
IDD Ordinance for the property, and any other information requested by staff,
the City Council shall review the proposed IDD Ordinance at a regularly
scheduled City Council meeting. The Council will review the proposed IDD
Ordinance for the property and suggest any modifications to said ordinance.
   F.   City Council Consideration (Second Meeting): If, at the first meeting
the City Council votes to send the proposed IDD development forward for an
official vote, the City Council shall approve, approve with modifications or
deny the application at a future regularly scheduled meeting. If the City
Council elects to approve the application in any form, the City Council shall,
by ordinance, approve the preliminary plan and plat and grant the zoning of
IDD, in accordance with those standards set forth on the preliminary plan and
plat, comprehensive management plan and IDD Ordinance for the property. Said
ordinance may authorize, in the discretion of the City Council, the submission
of final plans and plats, and the development of the IDD in phases and include
such conditions as the City Council may deem appropriate. No building permit or
occupancy certificate shall be issued until the recording of the final plan and
plat for the proposed IDD or the phase in which the property to which such
permit or certificate relates is located.
   G.   Final Plan And Plat:
      1.   Within one year after adoption of the ordinance approving the IDD,
the owner shall submit five (5) copies of final engineering plans, in
accordance with the approved preliminary plan and plat of subdivision, as well
as the City’s Subdivision Control and Development Ordinance and Technical
Specifications Manual. After which, the plans will be reviewed for compliance
with the City’s technical engineering standards for final development, as set
forth in the Subdivision Control and Development Ordinance and Technical
Specifications Manual. After receiving internal approval, the final plan and
plat shall be transmitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review. If
the Planning and Zoning Commission deems the plan and plat to be substantially
compliant with the preliminary plan and plat, they shall be approved and
recommended to the City Council for consideration.
      2.   This recommendation shall be transmitted in writing to the City
Council within thirty (30) days. Upon receipt, the City Council shall review
said final plan and plat and approve said plan and plat with modifications or
deny said plan and plat.
      3.   As a condition of approval of any IDD plan and plat, the Planning
and Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Council may stipulate such
conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, design, layout,
height, density, construction, maintenance, aesthetics, operation and other
elements of the IDD as deemed necessary for the protection of the public
interest, improvement of the development and protection of the adjacent area.
In all cases in which IDD are granted, the City Council shall require such
evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied with.
   H.   Changes And Modifications To Approved Plans:
      1.   If the final plan and plat are not in substantial compliance with
the approved preliminary plan and plat, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall not approve said final plan and plat and may require the submittal of a
new application. The City Council may, however, approve variances from any
phasing schedule contained within the ordinance granting the IDD without
requiring a new application.
      2.   After the final plan and plat approval, the development of the
property shall be in substantial conformance with the approved final plan and
plat and IDD Ordinance. No changes shall be made to the approved final plan,
except upon written application to the appropriate body in accordance with the
following procedures: minor changes, dealing primarily in the location, siting
of utilities, location of streets and ways of public access and in the size and
location of open space, shall be reviewed and may be authorized by the City
Administrator as required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at
the time that the final plan was approved if they are generally consistent with
the purpose and intent of the final plan.
      3.   All changes in land uses, rearrangement of lots, blocks, building
tracts and any major changes in the provision of open space and all other
changes in approved final plans must be made by the City Council. If an
amendment to the IDD is required then, an additional public hearing shall be
held at the Planning and Zoning Commission, after which the amendment and
recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be sent to the
City Council for review and approval, approval with conditions or denial. 
(Ord. 96-647; amd. Ord. 05-866)
11-11-5: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR DEVELOPMENT REVIEW:
The following criteria will be used to evaluate all proposals for development
under an IDD. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall, after the required
public hearing, set forth to the City Council the reason for recommendation and
said recommendation shall set forth with particularity what respects the
proposal are in the public interest, promoting the public health, safety and
welfare and including, but not limited to, findings of fact based on the

vehicular traffic and pedestrian circulation, accommodation for and protection
of designated open space and further the amenities of light, air, recreation
and visual enjoyment?
   E.   Does the plan provide appropriate street connectivity and functional
connection among buildings within the development, such as pedestrian
connections, that promote the public interest and enhance the quality of life
of persons within the development?
   F.   Is there a continuity of scale amongst the buildings to promote visual
enjoyment, while maintaining maximum sunlight exposure?
   G.   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to the adjacent
properties.
   H.   The desirability of the proposed plan with regard to physical
development, tax base and economic well being of the City.
   I.   The desirability of the proposed plan with regard to the burden placed
on City services and facilities in relation to the public benefits that will be
realized after the development of the property, including, but not limited to:

   D.   Site Landscaping (Interior Site Landscape In Addition To Any Screening
Strips): A landscaped area equal in size to at least ten percent (10%) of a
parking lot area shall be planted onsite using a mixture of plants. Building
and parking lot perimeter landscaping can be credited towards the ten percent
(10%) requirement. The Zoning Administrator has the right to reduce this
requirement based upon the uniqueness of the site.
   E.   Building Perimeter Landscaping: Building perimeter landscaping is the
combination of curbing and landscape materials which helps to break up the base
of a building. It also incorporates pedestrian walkways and a safe waiting area
outside the main entry doors. Some examples of how building perimeter
landscaping may be incorporated into a site are included below. Building
perimeter landscaping is not required at loading areas.

11-13-9: PLANTINGS LIST:
This list is not an exhaustive list of all plant materials that will be allowed
in the City. A registered landscape architect may propose additional species to
staff as long as they detail the plant’s specific properties. This list is
broken out into three (3) sections; recommended species, approved species and
undesirable species. The recommended species were selected to be used in areas
along roadways or detention areas because they are salt tolerant and root
friendly. The approved species were selected because they are native plants
which grow well in the Illinois climate and may also be salt tolerant. The
undesirable species are listed because they have problems such as spines, or
are an invasive species.

“corner side yard” and “rear yard”.
   A.   Obstructions: Court yards and required yards may be obstructed by
accessory uses or building projections only as provided in section
11-14-4, table 1 of this chapter.

yards or other open spaces shall be less than required by this title.
   D.   Vacant Through Lots: On a vacant through lot, either of the lot lines
abutting a street may be established as the front lot line, except that where
two (2) or more through lots are contiguous and a front lot line has been duly
established by the construction of a building on one lot, the same street lot
line shall serve as the front lot line of all such contiguous lots.
   E.   Corner Side Yards On Lots Of Record: If a corner lot that is a lot of
record as of the date of adoption of this section has insufficient width to
meet the requirement for the required corner side yard and still provide thirty
feet (30') of width for the building and the other side yard, then the required
corner side yard may be reduced to not less than thirty percent (30%) of the
lot width.
   F.   Conformity To Existing Required Front Yards:
      1.   The purpose of this provision is to protect view lines in single-
family residential neighborhoods, except where the view line from a home has
been voluntarily sacrificed by building with a setback that is greater than
that required in this or any applicable previous ordinance.
      2.   In any RS Residential District, where one or more side lot lines of
a lot abut one or more residential lots with a nonconforming front or corner
side yard, the minimum front and corner side yards on such lot shall be less
than the zoning district regulations require.
      3.   For such a lot that is an interior lot, the minimum required front
yard shall be the mean average of the actual required front yards established
on the two (2) abutting residential lots on either side. If there is no
structure on one of the abutting lots, the required front yard required by the
zoning district shall be used in lieu of the actual required front yard for
that lot to compute the average.
      4.   For such a lot that is a corner lot, the minimum front and required
corner side yard shall be the actual front or required corner side yard
abutting each such yard on the adjacent residential lot.
      5.   Where the actual front or corner side yards on the abutting lots are
conforming, the minimum front and corner side yards shall be as required in the
district regulations.
      6.   For such a lot that is a through-lot (double frontage lot), the lot
line abutting a street but does not have direct vehicular access shall be
considered a rear yard for the purposes of this section.
   G.   Vision Clearance Triangle: Within a triangular area located at the at-
grade intersection of two (2) streets, a street and a railroad, or a street and
a driveway, special restrictions apply.
      1.   The triangular area shall be formed by the right-of-way lines of the
streets or railroads between their intersection and points thirty feet (30')
from their intersection along each line, or ten feet (10') from the
intersection of a street and a driveway, and by a straight line connecting
these two (2) points.
      2.   Within this triangle, no solid fence, as defined in section
11-3-1 of this title, or any hedge, opaque landscaping or screening, wall or
other solid obstruction, having a height of over two and one-half feet (2-1/
2'), nor any open fence, as defined in section
11-3-1 of this title, with a height of over three and one-half feet (3-1/2'),
shall be permitted.
      3.   Overhanging objects, including tree branches, shall be permitted
within this triangle only if all parts thereof are higher than eight feet (8')
above the level of the railroad or the pavement of the street or driveway where
the centerlines intersect. Signs shall be permitted only if the sign clearance
is eight feet (8') or greater, or the sign height is two and one-half feet (2-
1/2') or less.

11-15-6: Issuance Of Permit
11-15-7: Revocation Of Permit
11-15-8: Expansion Or Alteration
11-15-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   Scope: Certain uses cannot be allowable generally in a particular
zoning district, or in any zoning district, because of the impact their special
character creates on surrounding areas.
   B.   Uses Permitted: Some such uses may, however, be allowed under special
conditions. These uses are provided for in this chapter as conditional uses.
   C.   Permit Required: Because a conditional use is compatible with the
applicable zoning district only under special conditions, a conditional use
permit is required before any use authorized herein as a conditional use may be
established.
   D.   Application: Except as specifically provided herein, all regulations of
the applicable zoning district, and all other applicable regulations of this
and other City ordinances, shall apply to conditional uses.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-15-2: APPROVAL PROCESS:
Conditional uses shall be approved only in conformance with the approval
process provided in the filing procedures section of this title and the
approval criteria in section
11-15-5 of this chapter.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-15-3: EXISTING SPECIAL USES:
   A.   Conditional Uses Same As Special Uses: Conditional uses, as provided
herein, shall be considered the same as special uses provided under State
Statute. Lawful special uses granted to a property prior to the effective date
of this title shall be considered lawful conditional uses without the need for
approval of a conditional use permit hereunder, whether or not such special use
is authorized as a conditional use in the applicable zoning district herein.
Where such a use is a permitted use in the applicable district, conditional use
status shall not be applicable.
   B.   Expansion, Alteration: Any expansion of, addition to, or structural
alteration of such a use shall, however, require the approval of a conditional
use permit.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-15-4: REVIEW OF CONDITIONAL USES:
   A.   Considerations: In evaluating the suitability of a proposed conditional
use, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall examine the
following characteristics of the proposed use and its individual structures or
components:
      1.   Location and orientation.
      2.   Lot size.
      3.   Size of facility, including floor area, structure height, design
capacity and anticipated employment.
      4.   Site design and arrangement.
      5.   Provisions affecting on and off site pedestrian and traffic
movement, vehicle storage and the passage of emergency vehicles.
      6.   Appearance.
      7.   Screening or landscaping.
      8.   On or off site buffering from incompatible uses with open spaces or
transitional uses.
      9.   Operations factors, such as hours of use or environmental controls.
      10.   Other characteristics of the proposed use pertinent in the judgment
of the Planning and Zoning Commission or Council to an assessment of the impact
of the use on the area.
   B.   Technical Experts, Studies: The Planning and Zoning Commission or the
Council may call upon technical experts or have studies performed to determine
specific development standards or conditions for any particular conditional
use, with the expense thereof to be paid by the applicant.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-15-5: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR CONDITIONAL USES:
In recommending approval or conditional approval of a conditional use, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall transmit to the City Council written
findings of fact that on the basis of the characteristics cited under review of
conditional uses herein, or changes to such characteristics that the Planning
and Zoning Commission recommends, the proposed use will be compatible with
existing uses in the area, and with permitted uses in the zoning district, in
the ways specified below. The Council shall not be bound by the recommendation
of the Planning and Zoning Commission. However, in granting approval or
conditional approval, the City Council shall find that the proposed use will be
compatible with such uses in the following ways:
   A.   Traffic: Any adverse impact of types or volumes of traffic flow not
otherwise typical in the zoning district has been minimized.
   B.   Environmental Nuisance: Any adverse effects of noise, glare, odor,
dust, waste disposal, blockage of light or air, or other adverse environmental
effects of a type or degree not characteristic of permitted uses in the zoning
district, have been appropriately controlled.
   C.   Neighborhood Character: The proposed use will fit harmoniously with the
existing natural or manmade character of its surroundings, and with permitted
uses in the zoning district. The use will not have undue deleterious effect on
the environmental quality, property values, or neighborhood character already
existing in the area or normally associated with permitted uses in the
district.
   D.   Public Services And Facilities: The proposed use will not require
existing community facilities or services to a degree disproportionate to that
normally expected of permitted uses in the district, nor generate
disproportionate demand for new services or facilities, in such a way as to
place undue burdens upon existing development in the area.
   E.   Public Safety And Health: The proposed use will not be detrimental to
the safety or health of the employees, patrons, or visitors associated with the
use nor of the general public in the vicinity.
   F.   Other Factors: The proposed use is in harmony with all other elements
of compatibility pertinent to the conditional use and its particular location.
(Ord. 91-553)
11-15-6: ISSUANCE OF PERMIT:
The Zoning Administrator shall issue a conditional use permit after approval
thereof by the City Council, unless the City Council directs otherwise. Such
permit shall specify any conditions, restrictions and time limits to which the
Council has made its approval subject.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-15-7: REVOCATION OF PERMIT:
A conditional use permit may be revoked at any time by a simple majority vote
of the City Council:
   A.   If any conditions or restrictions are not complied with within the time
limit specified in the ordinance granting said conditional use permit; or
   B.   If after they are initially complied with, compliance with such
conditions or restrictions is not maintained at any time; or
   C.   If the conditional use is not established, or a required building
permit is not obtained and building started, within one year of the date of the
ordinance granting said conditional use permit; or
   D.   If the conditional use ceases operation for more than one year.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-15-8: EXPANSION OR ALTERATION:
Any expansion, enlargement or structural alteration of a conditional use shall
require an additional conditional use permit.
(Ord. 12-1059)

11-16-2: Applicability
11-16-3: Nonconforming Uses
11-16-4: Nonconforming Structures
11-16-5: Nonconforming Lots Of Record
11-16-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate uses, structures, and lots that were
in compliance with previous zoning regulations, but do not conform to current
zoning regulations as a result of adoption of or amendments to this title. The
intent of this chapter is to specify the circumstances under which legal
nonconforming uses, structures, and lots may be continued, altered, or expanded
as well as circumstances under which such nonconformities shall be gradually
eliminated.
(Ord. 21-3, 1-18-2021)
11-16-2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Authority To Continue:
      1.   Any use, structure, or lot that was established legally as of the
effective date of this title, or its subsequent amendments, may continue as
long as it remains lawful.
      2.   Any use, structure, or lot that was established legally as of the
effective date of this title, or its subsequent amendments, and has been made
nonconforming due to the regulations of this title, or its subsequent
amendments, is a legal nonconforming use, structure, or lot and may continue
subject to the provisions of this chapter as long as it remains otherwise
lawful.
      3.   Any use, structure, or lot that was established illegally as of the
effective date of this title, or its subsequent amendments, shall remain
illegal if it does not conform with the requirements of this title.
      4.   If property is used in a manner that was classified as a permitted
use prior to the effective date of this title, and that use is now classified
as a conditional use as of the effective date of this title, that use is deemed
a nonconforming use. Such uses are allowed to continue and are controlled by
the provisions of this chapter. However, any addition, enlargement, or
expansion of the use is required to obtain a conditional use permit at the time
of the addition, enlargement, or expansion.
   B.   Nonconforming Status: The legal nonconforming status of a nonconforming
use, structure, or lot rests with the property and shall not be affected by
changes in property ownership, tenancy, or management.
   C.   Burden Of Establishing Legal Status: The burden of establishing the
legal status of a nonconforming use, structure, or lot under the provisions of
this title shall be the responsibility of the owner of such use, structure or
lot.
(Ord. 21-3, 1-18-2021)
11-16-3: NONCONFORMING USES:

the same lot or any other lot unless the relocation of such use meets the
requirements of the zoning district in which the use is relocated.
   D.   Damage Or Destruction Of Use:
      1.   In the event that any structure devoted in whole or in part to a
legal nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed to the extent of fifty percent
(50%) or more of its replacement value, then the use cannot be continued unless
it meets the requirements of the subject zoning district.
      2.   In the event that a legal nonconforming structure is damaged or
destroyed to the extent of less than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement
value, the structure may be repaired provided that:
         a.   The repairs will not create any new nonconformity or increase the
degree of any existing nonconformity.
         b.   A building permit is obtained for such repairs within one hundred
eighty (180) days of the date of damage or destruction, and such repairs are
completed within one year of issuance of the building permit.
      3.   The replacement value of the legal nonconforming structure shall be
established by:
         a.   The sale of the structure within the previous year, or if that is
not applicable;
         b.   An appraisal of the structure within the last two (2) years, or
if that is not available;

of damage or destruction, or if that is not available;
         d.   An alternative method determined acceptable by the Zoning
Administrator.
   E.   Change Of Use: A legal nonconforming use shall not be changed to any
other use unless the use is allowed within the subject zoning district.
   F.   Discontinuation Or Abandonment Of Use: If a legal nonconforming use is
discontinued, or the structure that it occupies becomes vacant or remains
unoccupied for a continuous period of at least 30 days, such use shall be
deemed abandoned and shall not be reestablished regardless of the intent to
continue the use. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure
shall meet the requirements of the subject zoning district. The following
exceptions apply:
      1.   If the period of such discontinuance is caused by government action
or acts of God, it is not included in calculating the length of discontinuance.
      2.   If the property owner files notice in writing of the suspension of a
nonconforming use with the Zoning Administrator prior to the expiration of the
continuous period of at least thrity (30) days. The Zoning Administrator may
approve an extension of such time frame not to exceed thirty (30) days.
   G.   Amortization Of Nonconforming Uses In Residential Zoning Districts: Any
nonconforming use of land located in a residential zoning district which
lawfully existed at the time that this title became effective, shall be
discontinued within one (1) year after the Zoning Administrator has provided
written notice to the property owner. This section does not apply to
nonconforming uses that received approval of a use variance.
   H.   Requests For Extensions Of Nonconforming Uses In Residential Zoning
Districts: The owner or operator of a nonconforming use in a residential zoning
district may request a six (6) month extension of the amortization period. The
applicant shall submit a detailed narrative to the Zoning Administrator
explaining the request that includes documentary evidence such as: 1) the
amount of the owner's investment in the pre-existing, nonconforming use through
the effective date of this title; 2) the amount of such investment that has
been or will have been realized at the conclusion of the amortization period;
3) the life expectancy of the nonconforming use; and 4) the existence or
nonexistence of lease obligations, as well as any contingency clauses therein
permitting termination of such lease. The Zoning Administrator shall approve or
deny the request based upon the documentary evidence.
   I.   Requests For Extensions Of Nonconforming Uses In Residential Zoning
Districts Greater Than Six (6) Months: City Council may grant an extension for
the continued operation of a nonconforming use in a residential zoning
district. In order to secure an extension of time greater than six (6) months,
the owner or operator must submit to the Zoning Administrator a written request
for such extension at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the
amortization period. No application for extension received after such time
shall be considered. This information shall be supported by relevant
documentary evidence such as: 1) the amount of the owner's investment in the
pre-existing, nonconforming use through the effective date of this title; 2)
the amount of such investment that has been or will have been realized at the
conclusion of the amortization period; 3) the life expectancy of the
nonconforming use; and 4) the existence or nonexistence of lease obligations,
as well as any contingency clauses therein permitting termination of such
lease. The Zoning Administrator shall notify an applicant of the time and place
of a public hearing to be held on such request before the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make a recommendation to
be transmitted to City Council who may approve or deny the request.

from unnecessary enforcement costs.
   A.   New Uses:
      1.   An application for a conditional use permit or a building permit for
an industrial use within the I-1 Industrial District shall include a
certification by a licensed engineer, licensed architect, or scientific
laboratory that the use involved in the application is able to meet all
applicable performance standards to the extent that this can be judged based on
the submitted building plans and other information available prior to
construction.
      2.   This certification shall be accompanied by copies of all data or
information supplied by the applicant and used as the basis of the
certification. The Zoning Administrator may refer the certification and data to
the City Engineer for review.
      3.   The Zoning Administrator may also require such certification for a
land use in any other zoning district when in his or her judgment the use has
potential to exceed any performance standard herein. Such certification may
include all performance standards or only individual standards specified by the
Zoning Administrator.
   B.   Existing Uses:
      1.   In enforcing performance standards on existing uses, the Zoning
Administrator may issue a written notice of violation to an alleged violator.
      2.   The Zoning Administrator shall, before issuing such notice, make
technical determinations of violation when such determinations can be made
using equipment and trained personnel normally available to the City or
obtainable without extraordinary expense.
      3.   In other cases, however, technical complexity or extraordinary
expense may make it unreasonable for the City to maintain personnel or
equipment for making determinations of violation prior to issuing a notice of
violation. In such cases, a notice of violation may be issued when the Zoning
Administrator has other reason to believe there is probable violation.
      4.   The Zoning Administrator shall give notice of violation by any means
that ensures a signed receipt for such notice to the party responsible for the
alleged violation.
      5.   The notice shall describe the alleged violation and the results of
technical determinations or the other reasons why the Zoning Administrator
believes there is a violation. The notice shall require either an answer or
correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Administrator and within a time limit he or she shall specify in the notice.
      6.   The notice shall also state that failure to provide an answer or
correct the alleged violation within this time limit shall constitute admission
of a violation.
      7.   The notice shall further state that, if technical determinations
have not already been made, upon request of the alleged violator such
determinations will be made. If a violation is found as a result of such
determinations, the cost of the determinations will be assessed against the
properties or parties responsible in addition to any other penalties provided
for. If no violation is found, the City will pay the cost of the
determinations.

shall be removed by the operator at least once every twenty four (24) hours.
   D.   Fencing, Landscaping And Screening:
      1.   Notwithstanding other provisions of this title on screening, because
of the superior noise attenuating properties of berms as compared with fencing
or plantings, a barrier consisting of a planted earth berm with a minimum
height of ten feet (10') and fencing with a minimum fence height of four and
one-half feet (41/2') shall be installed prior to commencement of operations:
         a.   Along all lot lines, or, at the option of the operator.
         b.   Along such lot lines and phase area boundaries as are adjacent to
areas currently being excavated.
      2.   Such barrier shall be sufficient to:
         a.   Screen the operation from view from adjacent properties and
public streets, except where a significant change in topography makes this
impractical; and
         b.   Discourage trespass by the public, such as with the use of barbed
wire or thorny plantings; and
         c.   Attenuate noise coming from the site that can be heard on
surrounding properties or public streets; and
         d.   Serve as wind breaks to reduce airborne dust adjacent to the
site.
      3.   The required berm shall be planted with ground cover over its entire
surface, except for portions planted in trees, shrubs or flowers, no later than
the next growing season after its installation.
      4.   Where a lot line of a mining operation abuts the boundary of a
Residential District, the berm shall be a minimum of fifty feet (50') from that
boundary.
      5.   Trees a minimum of ten feet (10') high at time of planting and
spaced a maximum of twenty five feet (25') apart shall be planted along the top
of any berm or portion thereof located within five hundred feet (500') of
extraction activity.

neat appearance, to prevent seeding on adjoining property, and to reduce the
hazard of grass fires.
   E.   Entrances:
      1.   A maximum of one entrance and one exit onto public streets shall be
provided.
      2.   Where possible, the entrance and exit shall avoid routing of
vehicles used in the operation over streets primarily serving residential
areas. Where necessary in the judgment of the City Council, paved acceleration
and deceleration lanes at least one hundred feet (100') in length shall be
provided on either side of an entrance or exit.
      3.   To minimize airborne dust and the deposit of dirt and gravel on
public streets, a drive into the site of not less than three hundred feet
(300') from the street right-of-way at each entrance or exit shall be either
paved or oiled or sprayed with calcium chloride or a similar product to create
a dust free surface.
   F.   Safety: All operations shall be conducted in a safe manner so as to
prevent harm to the public and damage to adjacent properties or adjacent public
streets.
   G.   Staged Removal Of Overburden: Overburden shall not be removed from more
land than is to be mined within one year. No overburden shall be removed from
additional land until ground cover in conformance with the Reclamation Plan is
installed on all land where excavation is complete and that is not being used
for material storage.

11-19-1: PURPOSE:
Because of special characteristics of particular properties in the City, the
literal application of the general provisions of this title may, in certain
instances, create hardships not intended by these regulations. The City Council
may accordingly grant variances from the literal application of the provisions
of this title based on findings of fact as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-19-2: APPROVAL PROCESS:
Variances shall be approved only in conformance with the approval process
provided in the filing procedures section of this title and the approval
criteria in section
11-19-5 of this chapter.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-19-3: MINOR VARIANCES:
   A.   Purpose And Scope: The purpose of minor variance procedures is to
reduce the time and expense to homeowners of obtaining approval of simple
variances that are likely to have minimal adverse impact in residential
neighborhoods.
   B.   Application: The fee owner, contract purchaser, or option holder of a
single family detached or attached dwelling or single family detached or
attached building lot that wishes to request a variance for that dwelling or
lot may apply under minor variance procedures.
   C.   Administrative Variation: Applications for minor variances may be
reviewed and approved administratively.
      1.   The Zoning Administrator will review, and may approve with
conditions, minor variance applications that meet the following standards:
         a.   A complete application has been submitted to the Zoning
Administrator.
         b.   A notice has been delivered via certified mail, return receipt
requested, to adjacent property owners that are abutting or across a public
right-of-way.
         c.   No written objections have been received. If any noticed property
owner files a written objection to the administrative variation within fifteen
(15) calendar days of receipt of such notice, the minor variance shall be
denied.
            (1)   If denied, the property owner may submit an application for
minor variance to be considered by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City
Council. Applicants requesting a review by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and City Council shall follow all procedural requirements as provided for in

(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986; amd. Ord. 20-20, 5-4-2020; Ord. 21-3, 1-18-2021)
11-19-4: EXISTING VARIANCES:
Variances, as provided herein, shall be considered the same as variations
provided under State Statute. Lawful variations granted to a property prior to
the effective date of this title shall be considered lawful variances without
the need for approval of a variance hereunder. Except that where such a
variation is not needed under this title, variance status shall not be
applicable.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-19-5: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR VARIANCES:
In recommending approval or conditional approval of a variance, the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall transmit to the City Council written findings of
fact that all of the conditions below apply to the application. The City
Council shall not be bound by the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning
Commission. However, in granting approval, the City Council shall similarly
find that all of the following conditions apply:
   A.   Special Circumstances Not Found Elsewhere: Special circumstances, fully
described in the written findings, exist that are peculiar to the property for
which the variance is sought and that do not apply generally to other
properties in the same zoning district. And these circumstances are not of so
general or recurrent a nature as to make it reasonably practical to provide a
general regulation to cover them.
   B.   Circumstances Relate To The Property Only: Since a variance will affect
the character of its surroundings long after a property changes hands, the
special circumstances referenced herein relate only to the physical character
of the land or building(s) for which a variance is sought, such as dimensions,
topography or soil conditions. They do not concern any business or activity the
present or prospective owner or tenant carries on, or seeks to carry on
therein, nor to the personal, business or financial circumstances of such owner
or tenant or any other party with interest in the property.
   C.   Not Resulting From Applicant Action: The special circumstances that are
the basis for a variance have not resulted from any act of the applicant or of
any other party with interest in the property.
   D.   Unnecessary Hardship: For reasons fully set forth in the written
findings, the strict application of the provisions of this title would result
in unnecessary and undue hardship upon the applicant, as distinguished from
mere inconvenience.
   E.   Preserves Rights Conferred By District: A variance is necessary for the
applicant to preserve and enjoy a substantial property right possessed by other
properties in the same zoning district and does not confer a special privilege
ordinarily denied to other properties in the district.
   F.   Necessary For Use Of Property: The grant of a variance is necessary not
because it will increase the applicant’s economic return, although it may have
this effect, but because without a variance the applicant will be deprived of
any reasonable use or enjoyment of the property.
   G.   Not Alter Local Character: The granting of the variance will not alter
the essential character of the locality, nor substantially impair environmental
quality, property values or public safety or welfare in the vicinity.
   H.   Consistent With Title And Plan: The granting of a variance will be in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title and of the
Comprehensive Plan of the City, as viewed in light of any changed conditions
since their adoption.
   I.   Minimum Variance Recommended: The variance recommended by the Planning
and Zoning Commission and approved by the City Council is the minimum required
to provide the applicant with reasonable use and enjoyment of his property.
(Ord. 86-382, 12-22-1986)
11-19-6: APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR USE VARIANCES:
In recommending approval of a use variance, the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall transmit to the City Council written findings of fact that all of the
conditions below apply to the application. The City Council shall not be bound
by the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission. However, in
granting approval, the City Council shall similarly find that all of the
following conditions apply:
   A.   Practical Difficulties Or Particular Hardship: For reasons fully set
forth in the written findings, the strict application of the provisions of this
title relating to the use of the buildings or structures, or the use of the
land, would result in unnecessary and undue hardship upon the applicant, as
distinguished from mere inconvenience.
   B.   Reasonable Return: The property cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
this title for the pertinent zoning district.
   C.   Unique Circumstance: Special circumstances, fully described in the
written findings, exist that are peculiar to the property for which the use
variance is sought and that they do not apply generally to other properties in
the same zoning district.
   D.   Not Alter Local Character: The granting of the use variance will not
alter the essential character of the locality, nor substantially impair
environmental quality, property values or public safety or welfare in the
vicinity.
   E.   Consistent With Title And Comprehensive Plan: The granting of a use
variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title
and of the Comprehensive Plan of the City.
(Ord. 94-614)
11-19-7: CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS:
The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend, and the City Council, in
granting any variance, may impose such conditions or restrictions as appear
necessary to minimize possible detrimental effects of such variance upon other
properties in the subject zoning district or surrounding neighborhood.
(Ord. 94-614)
11-19-8: REVOCATION OF VARIANCE:
A variance may be revoked by the City Council if:
   A.   Noncompliance: Any conditions or restrictions are not complied with
within the time limit specified on the variance;
   B.   Compliance Not Maintained: After they are initially complied with,
compliance with such conditions or restrictions is not maintained at any time;
   C.   Variance Not Established: The variance is not established or a required
building permit is not obtained and building started, within one year of the
date the variance is issued; or
   D.   Use Variance Ceases To Exist: With respect to use variances, in the
event the use granted by the variance shall cease to exist for more than three
hundred sixty five (365) consecutive days.

submitted a final plat for approval or a written request for an extension to
this period. If the City Council has not granted an extension and a final plat
is not submitted within this period, the preliminary plat shall be null and
void, and the subdivider shall resubmit a preliminary plat for review by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, in accordance with this title.
   F.   Subdivision Phasing: The approval of a preliminary plat by the City
Council may provide for the division of the subdivision into two (2) or more
sections for final plat approval, and may impose such conditions upon the
filing of the sections, as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly
development of the subdivision. If phasing is approved, specific approval of a
variance to section
12-4-5 of this chapter that provides a modified period of approval shall be
required.
   G.   Minor Amendments To Preliminary Plat: At any time after preliminary
plat approval and before submission of a final plat, the subdivider may request
that the Director of Public Works approve a minor amendment to the approved
plat or conditional approval. If, in the judgment of the Director of Public
Works, the proposed amendment will not substantially alter the overall layout
or design of the subdivision, said amendment shall be approved. The Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council shall consider all other amendments in
accordance with the same procedure for preliminary plat approval.

12-5-3: STREETS:
   A.   Scope: Streets shall be designed and constructed to conform to this
title and the Official Comprehensive Plan adopted by the City Council. They
shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to
topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and their appropriate
relation to proposed uses of the land to be served. Generally, all streets
shall be dedicated to public use, and arterial streets, in all cases, shall be
dedicated to public use. All public streets shall be completely improved to the
full width of the right-of-way. All street improvements shall be extended to
the boundaries of the subdivision or development.
   B.   General Street Layout And Design: No subdivision or development shall
be approved unless the area to be subdivided has frontage on and access from an
existing street, or a street shown upon a plat approved by the City and
recorded with the McHenry County Recorder of Deeds. Such existing or proposed
street must be improved as required by this title, the City Technical
Specifications Manual, and other requirements of law, or its improvement
secured by a construction guarantee as required under this title.
      1.   The arrangement of streets shall either:
         a.   Provide for the continuation of existing, planned or platted
streets in surrounding area; or
         b.   Conform to a plan for the adjacent area adapted to meet a
particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance
or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
      2.   Local streets shall be so designed to discourage through traffic
movements and excessive vehicular traffic, be designed to discourage excessive
speeds and minimize vehicle-pedestrian conflict points, and should not rely on
extensive traffic regulations in order to function efficiently and safely.
      3.   Where a parcel abuts or contains an existing arterial or collector
street, as shown on the Comprehensive Plan or Official Map, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may recommend and the City Council may require frontage
roads, double frontage lots with screen planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation not less than ten feet (10') wide along the rear property line, or
such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential
properties and to separate through and local traffic.
      4.   When any parcel or part of a parcel is adjacent to only one side of
an existing right-of-way, which is less than the required width required by the
development standards or the Official Map, the applicant shall dedicate
additional right-of-way to meet the specifications of these development
standards.
      5.   Half streets and private streets, alleys or thoroughfares are not
permitted.
      6.   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangements of
streets in new subdivisions shall be extended to the boundary line of the tract
to make provision for the future projection of streets into adjacent areas.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-5-4: BLOCK AND LOT LAYOUT:
   A.   Maximum Length: The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block length in residential areas shall not exceed one thousand five hundred
feet (1,500'), nor have less than sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers
of lots of appropriate depth between streets.
   B.   Pedestrian Easements: Pedestrian easements, not less than ten feet
(10') wide, may be required by the City Council through the center of blocks
more than nine hundred feet (900') in length where deemed necessary to provide
circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation
or other community facilities.
   C.   Lot Areas, Dimensions: Lot areas and dimensions shall conform to the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. Lots lying outside the corporate limits
of the City shall conform to the requirements of the zoning district most
closely related to the current or proposed use of the property, as provided in
the Comprehensive Plan and Official Map.
   D.   Commercial, Industrial Lots: Depth and width of lots reserved or laid
out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for off
street loading and parking facilities, as required by the Zoning Ordinance.
   E.   Double, Reverse Frontage Lots: Double frontage and reversed frontage
lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of
residential development from arterial streets or conflicting land uses, or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
   F.   Extra Depth For Residential Lots: Residential lots abutting arterial
and collector streets shall be platted with extra depth to provide greater
setback distances between the buildings and such trafficways. Vehicular access
to arterial and collector streets from such lots shall be prohibited.
   G.   Maximum Lot Depth: Excessive depth in relation to width shall be
avoided. A proportion of two and one-half (2-1/2) to one shall normally be
considered as a desirable maximum for lot widths of one hundred feet (100') or
more.
   H.   Determining Minimum Lot Area: In determining the minimum lot area under
this title and to meet the Zoning Ordinance requirements, both of the following
conditions must be met:
      1.   Ninety percent (90%) of the minimum lot area shall be at least two
feet (2') above the approximate high water elevation of any lake or stream
affecting the area; and
      2.   Eighty percent (80%) of the minimum lot area shall be at least three
feet (3') above the highest ground water level as estimated by the subdivider
or his agent from soil boring test data, and as verified by the Director of
Public Works.
   I.   Corner Lots: Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to
permit full front building setbacks on both streets as provided by the Zoning
Ordinance.
   J.   Right Angle Lots Avoided: Lots at right angles to each other should be
avoided.
   K.   Side Lot Lines: Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles
or radial to the street lines.
   L.   Follow Boundary Lines: Lots shall follow Municipal boundary lines
whenever possible.
   M.   Reserve Strips: Reserve strips controlling access to public utilities,
streets or other properties shall be prohibited.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-5-5: MONUMENTS:
Permanent monuments shall be placed in the subdivision as required by this
title and as approved by an Illinois registered land surveyor.
   A.   Location: Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines, at
street intersections, angle points of curve and block corners.
   B.   External Boundaries Of Subdivision: The external boundaries of a
subdivision shall be monumented in the field by concrete, not less than thirty
inches (30") length, not less than six inches (6") square or five inches (5")
in diameter, marked on top with an iron rod or other durable material securely
embedded; or by iron rods not less than thirty inches (30") in length and two
inches (2") in diameter.
   C.   Preservation Of Official Benchmarks: All U.S., State, County or other
official benchmarks, monuments or triangulation stations in or adjacent to the
subdivision shall be preserved in precise location.

(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-6-4: REVIEW OF ENGINEERING PLAN:
   A.   Submission Of Preliminary Engineering Plans And Studies: Preliminary
engineering plans and studies shall be submitted with the application for
approval of a preliminary plat requiring or proposing public improvements.
These plans shall be accompanied by payment of all fees and deposits required
by this title. No preliminary plat shall be approved unless the City determines
that public facilities will be adequate to support and service the area of the
proposed subdivision. The applicant shall submit sufficient information and
data to demonstrate the expected impact on and use of public facilities by
possible uses of said subdivision. Public facilities and services to be
examined for adequacy will include stormwater management, including
accommodations for off site drainage, roads, sanitary sewerage and water
service.
   B.   Preliminary Engineering Plan Review: The City shall review all
preliminary engineering plans and studies to determine if they are in
conformance with the requirements of law. Such review shall be completed within
forty five (45) days after submission of complete plans and payment of all
required fees and deposits. The City may approve the plans, may approve the
plans subject to modifications or conditions, or may disapprove the plans in
writing delivered to the subdivider stating the reasons for such disapproval.
The failure of the City to act within the time period specified, or such
further time to which the subdivider may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision to disapprove the plans. The City shall not approve a preliminary plat
until after the approval of the preliminary engineering plans and studies.
   C.   Submission Of Final Engineering Plans: In the case of a subdivision,
final engineering plans may be submitted only after approval of a preliminary
plat, and not later than the time of filing of an application for approval of
the final plat. In the case of a development, final engineering plans must be
submitted not later than the time of filing of an application for approval of a
building permit. These plans shall be accompanied by payment of all fees and
deposits required by this title.
   D.   Final Engineering Plan Review: The City shall review all final
engineering plans to determine if they are in conformance with the requirements
of law, and in the case of a subdivision, in substantial compliance with the
approved preliminary plat. Such review shall be completed within forty five
(45) days after submission of complete plans and payment of all required fees
and deposits. The City may approve the plans, may approve the plans subject to
modifications or conditions, or may disapprove the plans in writing delivered
to the subdivider or developer stating the reasons for such disapproval. The
failure of the City to act within the time period specified, or such further
time to which the subdivider or developer may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision to disapprove the plans.
   E.   Record (As Built) Drawings:
      1.   After completion of all public improvements and prior to final
acceptance of said improvements, the subdivider or developer shall provide to
the City record ("as built") drawings of the engineering plans revised to
reflect all improvements as constructed, and shall include all easements. All
elements of the approved plans that have been revised from the approved final
engineering plans shall be noted as revisions on the final engineering plans
and signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered in Illinois. The
presentation of these plans shall be a condition of final acceptance of the
improvements and release of the construction guarantee assuring their
completion.
      2.   Electronic format of the as built drawings of the development and
all public improvements shall also be submitted to the City. These plans shall
also be tied to NAVD 1988 Vertical Datum. These plans shall be delivered in
AutoCad 2000 (or latest version) format and shall be tied into Illinois State
Plane Coordinate System (NAD 83, 1997 revision) through established IDOT
monumentation. The City will supply the developer with the nearest location of
this monumentation for tie-in.
      3.   For all projects involving extensions to sanitary sewer mains, there
shall be submitted two (2) copies of reproducible mylar drawings, maximum size
two feet by three feet (2' x 3') of the "as built" plans, showing the actual
locations and grades of sewers and manholes and the locations of the service
connection to the main and terminus of the service. One copy shall be submitted
to the City Engineer and one copy shall be submitted to the Director of Public
Works.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-6-5: STREETS:
   A.   Street Classifications And Definitions:
      1.   Major Arterial: Major arterial routes serve the primary centers of
activity within the City, the highest traffic volume corridors and the longest
trip desires. They are roadways that display inter- City continuity, regional
importance and that provide reasonably continuous routes through the City.
Major arterials are facilities that carry traffic volumes greater than twelve
thousand (12,000) vehicles per day (vpd), and are usually under the
jurisdiction of the State or County governments.
      2.   Secondary Arterial: Secondary arterial routes interconnect and
augment the major arterials. They accommodate trips of moderate length, provide
slightly less mobility then the major arterials but provide more emphasis on
land access. Secondary arterials can also be those facilities that serve major
traffic flows between various districts within the City. Secondary arterials
are facilities that carry between five thousand (5,000) and twelve thousand
(12,000) vpd, and are typically under the jurisdiction of the County, Township
or the City.
      3.   Collector Street: Collector streets provide both land access service
and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods and commercial and
industrial areas. Collectors differ from arterials in that these roadways may
penetrate residential neighborhoods, distributing trips from the arterials
through the area to their ultimate destination. Collector streets are
facilities that which carry between one thousand (1,000) and five thousand
(5,000) vpd, and are typically under the jurisdiction of the City. Facilities
within the collector street classification are further classified by the
primary land use area that they serve (industrial collector, commercial
collector or residential collector).
      4.   Local Street: Local streets are all those facilities not in one of
the higher classifications. They primarily permit direct access to abutting
lands and provide connections to the higher order facilities. Service to
through traffic movements should be deliberately discouraged on these roads.
Local streets are facilities that carry less than one thousand (1,000) vpd and
are under the jurisdiction of the City. Facilities within the local street
classification are further classified by the primary land use area that they
serve (local industrial, local commercial, local residential or cul-de- sac).
   B.   Geometric Standards For Streets And Rights-Of-Way: All streets shall be
designed in accordance with tables 1 and 2 of this subsection.

Note:
      1.   See table 1 of this subsection.
   C.   Intersections And Offsets:
      1.   Streets shall intersect at ninety degrees (90°) whenever possible.
No two (2) streets shall intersect at an angle of less than seventy five
degrees (75°). An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection
and should be at right angles for a minimum of one hundred feet (100')
therefrom.
      2.   No more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point.
      3.   Proposed intersections along one side of an existing street shall,
whenever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite
side of such street. Street or driveway jogs with centerline offsets of less
than one hundred fifty feet (150') shall not be permitted and jogs with
centerline offsets of less than two hundred twenty five feet (225') between
minor and collector or arterial streets shall be discouraged, except where the
intersected street or driveway has separate dual drives without median breaks
at either intersection.
      4.   Provisions shall be made for vehicular and pedestrian access to
residential property abutting an arterial street either by providing: a) a
marginal access street; or b) by backing lots to the thoroughfare and providing
access by a collector, minor or cul-de-sac street one lot depth removed and
with a no access strip easement not less than ten feet (10') wide along the
rear lot line. These standards are established for the purpose of providing
protection for the residential properties and to provide for traffic safety and
the efficient use of the major street for its intended function of
accommodating through traffic.
      5.   Deceleration and left turn lanes shall be provided for access from
all arterial or collector streets onto all streets, including, without
limitation, Federal, State, County or Township highways. When an existing lot’s
only access is from an arterial street, the intersection of a proposed driveway
with the arterial street shall require the installation of acceleration/
deceleration lanes along the arterial street to provide for vehicular safety.
      6.   A clear minimum sight distance shall be provided for all
intersections in accordance with subsection B, table 2 of this section.
   D.   Cul-De-Sacs: Cul-de-sacs may be permitted in subdivisions where land
availability, site planning or traffic control purposes determine a through
street is not practicable. A maintenance fee, in accordance with subsection
12-3-4A of this title, shall be required for each cul-de-sac in a subdivision.
      1.   The maximum length of a cul-de-sac shall be six hundred feet (600'),
as measured along its centerline from the center of the cul-de-sac circle to
the nearest right-of-way of the intersecting street.
      2.   Cul-de-sacs shall have a concentric teardrop shape with a minimum
right-of-way of one hundred forty feet (140') in diameter.
      3.   The center of the cul-de-sac shall have a minimum pavement diameter
of ninety feet (90').
   E.   Pavement And Design Specifications: All pavements shall be designed in
accordance with the City Technical Specifications Manual. The Director of
Public Works may, as a result of traffic analysis, soil analysis or State or
County requirements, require standards for a street that are more strict than
those established in the City Technical Specifications Manual.
   F.   Curbs And Gutters: PCC curbs and gutters shall be provided on all new
streets, and on existing streets within or adjacent to the subdivision in
accordance with the City Technical Specifications Manual.
   G.   Street Names: New street names shall not duplicate or be deceptively
similar to the names of existing streets, but streets that are continuations of
others already in existence shall bear the name of the existing streets.
Streets shall have one word names to avoid confusion.
   H.   Signs, Street Name And Traffic Control: Street name and traffic control
signs shall be installed by the City, at the sole cost of the subdivider, at
each intersection in accordance with the City Technical Specifications Manual.
   I.   State Or County Approvals: Any construction within or changes to
rights-of-way under the jurisdiction of the State, County or Township shall
require the approval of that jurisdiction in addition to City Council approval
before any construction is allowed to begin.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-6-6: SIDEWALKS:
Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of all streets within all new
subdivisions or developments. Sidewalks may also be required in other locations
when the City Council, in its sole discretion, determines that such sidewalks
are necessary for public safety or convenience. All sidewalks shall be
constructed in accordance with the City Technical Specifications Manual. The
Plat Office may, in his sole discretion, require payment of a fee in lieu of
sidewalk construction, when it is determined that the construction of sidewalks
within a subdivision or development is impractical or unnecessary. Said fee
shall be based on the linear footage of the sidewalk that would normally be
required times the construction cost to install such sidewalk, as established
from time to time by the City.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-6-7: BIKEWAYS:
All subdivisions and developments shall provide for bikeways as indicated in
the City Comprehensive Plan, Official Map, or as otherwise determined by the
City Council when considered appropriate for public safety or convenience.
Bikeways may be substituted for sidewalks in locations approved by the Director
of Public Works. All bikeways shall be constructed in accordance with the City
Technical Specifications Manual.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-6-8: STREETLIGHTING:
Streetlighting shall be provided in every subdivision and development, and
shall be constructed in accordance with the City Technical Specifications
Manual.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-6-9: WATER SERVICE:
   A.   Service Required: A complete water supply and distribution system,
including all piping, valves, fire hydrants and other appurtenances, shall be
provided for all new subdivisions or developments. In the case of any
buildings, residential, commercial or industrial, constructed prior to the
adoption of this title and served by a private well, the following shall apply:
Any building located within the City limits, the property line of which
building is located within two hundred feet (200') of a water distribution
line, shall have its water piping system connected to the said water
distribution line. Any parcel and/or building located outside the City shall be
required to annex into the City prior to connecting onto the City water
distribution system, and any and all expenses incurred to extend said water
distribution system would be totally at the property owner’s expense.
   B.   System Standards: Before commencing the water distribution system
layout, the developer shall confer with the City Engineer to determine the
required size for any water distribution lines traversing the subdivision or
lot to fit the City’s available capacities of off site downstream existing
facilities with the estimated increment of flow caused by the subdivision,
proposed development and any future off site development.
      1.   In no case shall the size of any water main be less than eight
inches (8") in diameter for residential or twelve inches (12") in diameter for
nonresidential developments.
      2.   Water mains shall extend to the extremities of streets, easements or
property lines that are served by the mains and shall be arranged to avoid dead
ends. All water distribution system piping shall be constructed within public
rights-of-way or within approved easements dedicated for public utilities.
Whenever feasible, the developer is required to design looped water mains.
      3.   Shutoff valves shall be provided at each branch main connection and
elsewhere, as determined by the Director of Public Works, to permit adequate
sectionalizing for maintenance and repair purposes.
      4.   A building service connection shall be provided for each lot and
principal building and shall extend to a point within one foot (1') of the
property line of the property being served. Such building service connection
shall be installed prior to installation of any pavement over the area of such
connection.
      5.   All attached and detached single-family dwelling units shall be
served directly by separate water piping connected to the City’s water
distribution system and not to be of common service as specified in the
Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois,
latest edition.
   C.   Design And Construction: Every water supply and distribution system
shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of law,
including, without limitation, the City Technical Specifications Manual and
Master Plan for Public Utilities, and in such a manner as to provide each lot
and principal building with a separate service connection.
   D.   Fire Hydrants:
      1.   Fire hydrants shall be installed throughout all additions to the
water system in accordance with the City Technical Specifications Manual. In no
case shall the spacing of required fire hydrants be greater than three hundred
feet (300').
      2.   The removal of water from any fire hydrant shall not be permitted
unless otherwise approved by the Director of Public Works.
   E.   Unauthorized Use: No part of the water distribution system shall be

This chapter is intended to assure the provision of public facilities needed to
serve new development by requiring each new development to pay its fair share
of the costs of such improvements as a condition of approval, and to mitigate
the adverse impacts from inadequate community facilities by providing a means
of allocating the costs of needed services and facilities among new
developments in proportion to the demand for such facilities created by each
new development.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-8-2: APPLICABILITY:
Unless otherwise provided for in an annexation agreement with the City, as a
condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, planned unit development
or building permit, each subdivider shall dedicate land and/or make cash
donations in lieu of land for park and school sites and cash donations for
library and fire protection services to serve the immediate and future needs of
the residents of the development, in accordance with the criteria and formulas
as hereinafter set forth.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-8-3: IMPOSITION OF DONATIONS:
Developer donations shall be imposed as a condition of approval for all new
subdivisions.
   A.   When Due: Within the corporate boundaries of the City, developer
donations shall be imposed at the time of final plat approval in the case of a
land donation, or issuance of a building permit in the case of a cash donation.
If not sooner paid, however, one-half (1/2) of said cash donations shall be due
and payable eighteen (18) months after approval of the final plat, and the
remaining amount of said cash donations shall be due and payable thirty six
(36) months after approval of the final plat.
   B.   Final Plat Approval Received: For a subdivision within the corporate
boundaries of the City that has received final plat approval prior to the
effective date of this title, and for which no replatting or approval is
necessary prior to issuance of a building permit, developer donations shall be
imposed at the time of issuance of a building permit.
   C.   Outside City Limits: For a subdivision outside the corporate boundaries
of the City that is subject to subdivision approval by the City, the Governing
Body of any governmental entity which would be entitled to land and/or cash
donations pursuant to this section may request that the City vary the terms of
this section by allowing such governmental entity to make its own agreement
and/or waiver as to any or all of the donations required in this section with
the subdivider of such land. The request shall be made in writing by a
resolution adopted by the Governing Board of such governmental entity. In such
event, the City may, by motion, condition subdivision approval upon compliance
with the provisions of this section as modified by the variance or waiver.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-8-4: DONATIONS BASED ON PROJECTED POPULATION:
   A.   Scope: The ultimate density of a proposed subdivision shall bear
directly upon the amount of land required for donation for park and school
purposes. The projected population shall be computed in accordance with
subsection B, table 1 of this section, which is generally indicative of current
and short range projected trends in family size by age groups. Subsection B,
table 1 of this section is based on the Table of Estimated Ultimate School
Population Per Dwelling Unit, published for 1996 by Illinois School Consulting
Service/Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc., Naperville, Illinois.
   B.   Table 1: Table 1 of this subsection shall be used for all population
estimates unless a subdivider files a written objection to the City's data,
together with their own demographic study showing the estimated population to
be generated by the subdivision. In such event, the final determination of the
density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the City on
the basis of the foregoing data, data submitted by the subdivider and from
other relevant sources. It is recognized that the population density, age
distribution and local conditions change over time and that table 1 of this
subsection is subject to periodic review and amendment, if necessary.

12-8-5: PARK LAND DONATION CRITERIA:
   A.   Required Land Donation: The amount of land to be donated for park sites
for a particular subdivision shall be a direct function of the ultimate
population to be generated by the subdivision. The City has determined that the
land donation requirement shall be one and one-half (1.5) acres of park land
per one hundred (100) ultimate population.
   B.   Credit For Private Park Areas:
      1.   When a subdivision includes private open space for park and
recreation areas and facilities, it may have the effect of reducing the demand
for local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the
subdivision, a portion of the park land donation may, at the sole option of the
City, be provided as private, in lieu of dedicated public park land. The extent
of the required public park land shall be determined by the City, and based on
the needs of the current and future residents in the general area.
      2.   In general, a substitution of private park land in lieu of public
park land requires a higher degree of improvement and the installation of
recreational equipment or improvements by the subdivider. The City must approve
detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be
installed, and the subdivider must guarantee that these areas will be
permanently maintained for such use before any credit is given for private park
land.
   C.   Improvements: Prior to conveyance, all sites shall be final graded and
seeded in accordance with the City Technical Specifications Manual. The slope,
topography and geology of the dedicated site must be suitable for active park
and recreation purposes.
   D.   Location Of Land To Be Donated: The City shall determine the location
of park land to be donated for a particular subdivision. This determination
shall be based on the availability of land, the suitability of the land for
park and recreation purposes, the location of the land relative to population
concentrations, the proximity of the land to other park sites, and park and
open space locations identified in the Comprehensive Plan.
   E.   Minimum Size And Quality Of Donated Land: The minimum size of any land
to be dedicated for park and recreation purposes shall be ten thousand (10,000)
square feet, with no exterior boundary dimension less than one hundred feet
(100'), except as may be approved by the City because of special circumstances.
Stormwater detention or retention areas shall not qualify as land suitable for
donation for park and recreation purposes, except as may be approved by the
City after the suitability of such land for park and recreation purposes as a
secondary use is clearly demonstrated.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-8-6: SCHOOL LAND DONATION CRITERIA:
   A.   Required Land Donation: The amount of land required to be donated for
school sites for a particular subdivision shall be a direct function of the
ultimate number of students to be generated by the subdivision. The land
donation requirement shall be determined in accordance with the following
equation:
Estimated number of children to be served in each school classification.
(Calculated in accordance with subsection
12-8-4B, table 1 of this chapter.)
Divided by
Maximum number of students that can be served in each school classification.
(Calculated in accordance with subsection B of this section.)
Multiplied by
Minimum acreage for each school site in each school classification. (Calculated
in accordance with subsection B of this section.)
   B.   School Classifications And Size Of School Sites: School classifications
and the required minimum size of new school sites shall be determined in
accordance with the following standards:
 
School Classification By Grade Level Maximum Students Minimum Acreage
Elementary (K - 5)                   450              20
Junior high (6 - 8)                  600              35

be determined by the City, as guided by the Comprehensive Plan and standards
adopted by the affected school district.
   D.   Minimum Quality Of Donated Land: Stormwater detention or retention
areas shall not qualify as land suitable for donation for a school site, except
as may be approved by the City after the suitability of such land for a school
site as a secondary use is clearly demonstrated.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)
12-8-7: CASH IN LIEU OF LAND; COMBINATION OF LAND AND CASH:
   A.   Criteria For Requiring Cash Donation: When a subdivision is small and
the resulting land donation is too small to be practical or when the available
land is otherwise inappropriate for a park or school site, the City shall
require the subdivider to pay a cash donation in lieu of the required land
donation, or a combination of a land donation and cash donation.
   B.   Calculation Of Cash Donation: The cash donation shall be based on the
“fair market value” of the required land donation, as specified herein.
   C.   Fair Market Value: Based on a study of real estate transactions in the
planning jurisdiction of the City, the City has determined that the fair market
value of improved land within the planning jurisdiction of the City is eighty
thousand dollars ($80,000.00) per acre. The fair market value is for vacant
land that is zoned Residential, subdivided, fully improved with public sanitary
and water service, and is otherwise capable of being used for residential
development. This fair market value shall be regularly reviewed, and amended if
necessary, to ensure its accuracy, and shall be used in making any calculation
of the cash donation in lieu of land donation as specified herein, unless a
timely objection is provided.
   D.   Method Of Calculating Number Of Bedrooms; Supplementary Payments:
      1.   In those situations where a cash donation is due upon issuance of a
building permit, such donation shall be calculated pursuant to subsection
12-8-4B, table 1 of this chapter, on the basis of the type of residential unit
to be constructed and the number of bedrooms specified.
      2.   In those situations where a cash donation is due prior to issuance
of a building permit, such cash donation shall be calculated pursuant to
subsection
12-8-4B, table 1 of this chapter, on the basis that detached single-family
dwellings will contain a minimum of three (3) bedrooms, and that apartments,
townhouses, row houses and quadriplexes will contain a minimum of two (2)
bedrooms; provided, however, that if later an application for building permit
is made showing more than the aforesaid number of bedrooms per dwelling unit,
the applicant for such building permit shall then pay a supplementary cash
donation to the City to make up the difference between the amount previously
paid and the amount required for the actual number of bedrooms to be
constructed in such residential dwelling unit.
   E.   Objections To Fair Market Value: In the event of any written objection
to the fair market value, the applicant shall submit an appraisal showing the
fair market value of improved land in the area of the subdivision or
development, or other evidence thereof. The final determination of such fair
market value shall be made by the City Council, based upon information
submitted by the applicant and from other relevant sources.
   F.   Disposition Of Cash Donations:
      1.   Cash donations in lieu of park land dedications shall be held in
trust by the City, in a special segregated fund, solely for the acquisition or
development of park and recreational land and facilities to serve the immediate
or future needs of the residents.
      2.   Cash donations in lieu of school site donations shall be held in
trust solely for the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development.
         a.   Sixty five percent (65%) of the cash donations shall be remitted
to the grade school district affected by said subdivision or development, and
thirty five percent (35%) shall be remitted to the affected high school
district.
         b.   The City shall remit the cash donations to the affected school
district not less frequently than annually, who shall hold such contributions
in a special segregated fund.
   G.   Refund Of Cash Donations: If any portion of a cash donation is not
expended for the purposes set forth herein within twenty (20) years after the
date of receipt of such donation by the City, then that donation shall be
refunded, upon written application, to the subdivider who made such donation,
or its successor or assign.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004; amd. Ord. MC-19-1213, 12-2-2019)
12-8-8: RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND:
When the Comprehensive Plan or other applicable standard or policy of the City
requires a park or school site in a particular subdivision that is larger than
the subdivider is required to donate, then the land needed in excess of the
required donation shall be reserved by the subdivider for subsequent purchase
by the City or other public body designated by the City; provided, that such
acquisition is initiated within one year after the date of approval of the
final plat.
(Ord. 04-841, 1-19-2004, eff. 2-1-2004)

12-8-11: UPDATING OF FAIR MARKET VALUE AND REQUIRED DONATIONS:
   A.   Regular Review: It is recognized that the population density, age
distribution, land values, the cost of providing park, school, library and fire
protection services, construction costs and other local conditions change over
time. Therefore, the specific formula for the dedication of land, or cash
donations in lieu of thereof, shall be regularly reviewed, and amended if
necessary, and the required contribution for library and fire protection
services and the fair market value of land in the planning jurisdiction of the
City shall be regularly updated.

perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, rip-rapping or other armoring, widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of channel modification typically involving a significant change in the channel
cross section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of a
proposed change to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval, pursuant to
this title, gives assurances to the property owner that once an appropriate use
is constructed according to permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed,
as previously agreed, upon review and acceptance of as built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that the
Federal Emergency Management Agency will revise base flood elevations, flood
insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective
Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, once the as built plans
are submitted and approved.
CONTROL STRUCTURE: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes
through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface
elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood
protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants, water treatment plants and pumping stations.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion
of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally depicted on
the FEMA/FIRM Map, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year
frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to
the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%)
increase in velocities.
   A.   The floodways are designated for on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate
Map of McHenry County prepared by FEMA and dated November 16, 2006. When two
(2) floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more restrictive floodway limit
shall prevail.
   B.   The floodways for those parts of unincorporated McHenry County that are
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City that may be annexed into
the City are designated for the Fox River, Boone Creek and Lakeland Park
Drainage Ditch on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by FEMA and
dated November 16, 2006.
   C.   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated
floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located
on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation
is needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary,
IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Any manmade change to real estate, including:
      1.   Construction, reconstruction, repair or placement of a building or
any addition to a building.
      2.   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a
site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days. If the travel trailer or

not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable
nonelevation design requirements of this title.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designated for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term
manufactured home does not include a recreational vehicle. Generally,
manufactured homes must meet the same requirements as stick built or
conventional housing. Because they are usually residential buildings, they must
be elevated so that the lowest floor is above the base flood elevation (BFE).

soil erosion and sedimentation control, and channel restoration. Mitigation may
also include those activities taken to reduce a structure’s susceptibility to
flooding.
NAVD 88: National American Vertical Datum of 1988. NAVD 88 supersedes the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929.
NATURAL: When used in reference to channels means those channels formed by the
existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A
natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its floodplain is not
constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or
cultivated; the stream flows over soil and geologic materials typical of the
area with no substantial alteration of the course of cross section of the
stream caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel may regain some
natural characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is re-
established. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more natural
conditions by man through regrading and revegetation.

separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty five
percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
RETENTION/DETENTION FACILITY: A retention facility stores stormwater runoff
without a gravity release. A detention facility provides for storage of
stormwater runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a
flood or storm.
RIVERINE SFHA: Any SFHA subject to flooding from a river, creek, intermittent
stream, ditch, on- stream lake system or any other identified channel. The term
does not include areas subject to flooding from lakes, ponding areas, areas of
sheet flow, or other areas not subject to overbank flooding.
RUNOFF: The water derived from melting snow or rain falling on the land
surface, flowing over the surface of the ground or collected in channels or
conduits.
SEDIMENTATION: The processes that deposit soils, debris and other materials
either on other ground surfaces or in bodies of water or watercourses.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): See definition of FLOODPLAIN.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means

buildings, see definition of repetitive loss.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT:
   A.   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a
structure, taking place subsequent to the adoption of this title in which the
cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair started.
   B.   Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the building. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done.
   C.   The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
State or local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a “historic structure” listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places;
provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure.

CHAPTER 2: ADMINISTRATION; PERMIT REQUIREMENTS
Section
13-2-1: Administration
13-2-2: Duties Of Building Officer
13-2-1: ADMINISTRATION:
   A.   Enforcement Official: The Building Officer shall be responsible for
fulfilling all of the duties listed in section
13-2-2 of this chapter.
   B.   Criteria: To fulfill those duties, the Building Officer first should
use the criteria listed in chapter 3, "Base Flood Elevation", of this title, to
determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. Once it
has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the Building
Officer must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a
designated floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain on which no floodway has
been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the Building Officer
shall require that the minimum requirements of chapter 4 of this title be met.
If the site is within a floodway, the Building Officer shall require that the
minimum requirements of chapter 5 of this title be met. If the site is located
within a SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and
approved, the Building Officer shall require that the minimum requirements of
chapter 6 of this title be met.
   C.   Applicable General Requirements: In addition, the general requirements
of chapter 7 of this title shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of chapter 4, 5 or 6 of this title. The Building Officer shall
assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of chapter 8
of this title.
   D.   Variances: If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Building
Officer shall review the requirements of chapter 9 of this title to make sure
they are met. In addition, the Building Officer shall complete all notification
requirements.
   E.   Violations; Penalty: In order to assure that property owners obtain
permits as required in this title, the Building Officer may take any and all
actions as outlined in sections
13-1-5 and 13-1-6 of this title.
(1987 Code § 8-3.0)
13-2-2: DUTIES OF THE BUILDING OFFICER:
The Building Officer shall be responsible for the general administration and
enforcement of this title, which shall include the following:
   A.   Determining Floodplain Designation:
      1.   Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a
special flood hazard area (SFHA). If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they
are in a floodway, flood fringe or a floodplain on which a detailed study has
not been conducted and which drains more than one square mile.
      2.   Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA
(with a drainage area less than 1 square mile), indicating that the development
would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance or inundation, which
would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain
and floodway and be subject to the remaining provisions of this title.
   B.   Professional Engineer Review: If the development site is within a
floodway or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted
and which drains more than one square mile, the permit shall be referred to a
registered professional engineer (PE) under the employ or contract of the City
for review to ensure that the development meets the requirements of chapter 5
or 6 of this title. In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in
writing that the development meets the requirements of chapter 6 of this title.
   C.   Dam Safety Requirements:
      1.   Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard damage
potential in the event of failure. The construction or major modification of
all Class I (high hazard) and Class II (moderate hazard) dams requires an IDNR/
OWR dam safety permit. Some Class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam
safety permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam
and the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off channel detention basins
that have an embankment are nonjurisdictional Class III dams. It is not
required that IDNR/OWR sign off on all nonjurisdictional Class III dams.
      2.   A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a
hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is
required. A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the
construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams. Regulated dams may
include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures.
   D.   Other Permit Requirements: Ensure that any and all required Federal,
State and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
   E.   Plan Review And Permit Issuance: Ensure that all development activities
within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the City meet the requirements of this
title and issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the
provisions of this title and other regulations of this community when the
development meets the conditions of this title.
   F.   Inspection Review: Inspect all development projects before, during and
after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
they comply with the provisions of this title. Schedule on an annual basis an
inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the inspection.
   G.   Damage Determinations: Make damage determinations of all damaged
buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged
structures which must comply with chapter 7 of this title.
   H.   Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain in the permit files
including:
      1.   An Elevation Certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building subject
to chapter 7 of this title; and/or
      2.   The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been
floodproofed, using a Floodproofing Certificate, for all buildings subject to
chapter 7 of this title.
   I.   Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base designated floodway maps, copies of Federal or State
permit documents, variance documentation, Conditional Letter of Map Revision,
Letter of Map Revision, Letter of Map Amendment, and as built elevation and
floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all buildings constructed
subject to this title.
   J.   State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by the IDNR, for all development projects subject to chapters 5 and 6 of this
title, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the City.
However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the City and shall
require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      1.   Organizations which are exempt from this title, as per the Illinois
Compiled Statutes;
      2.   IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures, as defined in
section
13-1-2 of this title, and all other State, Federal or local unit of government
projects, including projects of the City and County, except for those projects
meeting the requirements of subsection
13-5-11 of this title.
      3.   An engineer’s determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per subsection
13-5-7E of this title.
      4.   An engineer’s analysis of the flood profile due to subsection
13-5-7D of this title;
      5.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage as indicated in subsections
13-5-7A, B and H of this title;
      6.   Permit issuance of structures within, under or over publicly
navigable rivers, lakes and streams;
      7.   Any changes in the mapped floodway or published flood profiles.
   K.   Cooperation With Other Agencies: Cooperate with State and Federal
floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency
flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this title. Submit
data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a designated map within six
(6) months whenever a modification of the floodplain may change the base flood
elevation or result in a change in the floodplain map. Submit reports as
required for the National Flood Insurance Program. Notify FEMA of any proposed
amendments to this title.
   L.   Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary
to administer and enforce the provisions of this title, subject however to the
review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any ordinance changes.

13-3-1: BASE FLOOD OR FREQUENCY FLOOD ELEVATION:
This title’s protection standard is based on the Flood Insurance Study for the
City. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not
available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available from Federal, State or other
sources. When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall submit
a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data
and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any
development of the site.
   A.   Fox River, Boone Creek, Lakeland Park: The base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of Fox River, Boone Creek and the
Lakeland Park drainage ditch, shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood
profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of the City prepared by FEMA and dated
November 16, 2006, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be
prepared from time to time.
   B.   Unincorporated Areas Within Extra Territorial Jurisdiction: The base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of
unincorporated McHenry County that are within the extra territorial
jurisdiction of the City, or that may be annexed into the City shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of
McHenry County prepared by FEMA and dated November 16, 2006, and such
amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to
time.
   C.   AH Or AO Zones: The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
for each SFHA delineated as an AH Zone or AO Zone shall be that elevation (or
depth) delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of McHenry County.
   D.   Remaining A Zones: The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an A Zone on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map of McHenry County shall be according to the best existing data
available from Federal, State or other sources. Should no other data exist, an
engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood
elevations.
   E.   Riverine: When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine
SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS or a
dynamic model such as HIP.
   F.   Flood Flows Used: The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be
obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-I, TR-20 or HIP, or by
techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States
Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges.
   G.   Nonriverine: For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be
the historic flood of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a
detailed engineering study.
   H.   Unmapped Extended SFHA: For an unmapped extended SFHA (with drainage
area less than 1 square mile) which has been identified by the Building Officer
pursuant to section
13-2-2 of this title, the base flood elevation shall be determined by the
applicant utilizing a method as approved in this section.

13-4-10: Construction Of The Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE)
13-4-1: SCOPE:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of
this title are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the
capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the
flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this chapter, along with the
requirements of chapter 7 of this title.
(1987 Code § 8-6.0)
13-4-2: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by State law
shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
development permit from the Building Officer.
(1987 Code § 8-6.1)
13-4-3: APPLICATION FOR PERMIT:
Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the
Building Officer. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site,
drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description of the
property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor;
existing grade elevations using the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed
buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest
adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will
be subject to the requirements of chapter 7 of this title.
(1987 Code § 8-6.2)
13-4-4: ELEVATION COMPARISON:
Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Building Officer shall
compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base
flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map and which has not been
filled after the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate Map without a
permit as required by this title is not in the SFHA and, therefor, not subject
to the requirements of this title. Conversely, any development located on land
shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but
show on the current Flood Insurance Rate Map, is subject to the provisions of
this title. The Building Officer shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site’s first Flood Insurance Rate
Map identification.
(1987 Code § 8-6.3)
13-4-5: SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PLAN:
A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas shall be
submitted. This plan shall include a description for the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post construction maintenance.
(1987 Code § 8-6.4)
13-4-6: LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL PERMITS:
The Building Officer shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant,
copies of all other local, State and Federal permits, approvals or waivers that
may be required for this type of activity. The Building Officer shall not issue
a permit unless all other local, State and Federal permits have been obtained.
(1987 Code § 8-6.5)
13-4-7: PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES:
No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and
safety.
(1987 Code § 8-6.6)
13-4-8: LETTER OF MAP REVISION:
If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and
obtain a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing
the site from the floodplain.
(1987 Code § 8-6.7)
13-4-9: COMPENSATORY STORAGE:
Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space
which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by
a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood
or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least
equal to one and one-half (1-1/2) times the volume of storage lost due to the
fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation
shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All
floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage
lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the
proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to
drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
(1987 Code § 8-6.8)
13-4-10: CONSTRUCTION OF THE LOWEST FLOOR BELOW THE BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE):
A person who has obtained a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill that removes a
site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate
the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the City to construct the
lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The
Building Officer shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has
complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsections.
   A.   Compensatory Storage: Compensatory storage shall be provided per
section
13-4-9 of this chapter.
   B.   Elevation Of Lowest Opening: The elevation of the lowest opening in the
basement wall (i.e., window wells, accessways) shall be at or above the flood
protection elevation (FPE).
   C.   Lowest Adjacent Grade To Foundation: The lowest adjacent grade to the
foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet
(10') beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are
such that this requirement cannot be met, the Building Officer may waive the
ten foot (10') minimum setback if an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer
certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to
hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of
a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to
the Building Officer for review. The Building Officer may require such
additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter
setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the
setback distance be less than four feet (4').
   D.   Perimeter Grade: The grade around the perimeter of the structure,
measured at a distance of twenty feet (20') from the structure, shall be above
the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be
obtained, the Building Officer may waive the twenty foot (20') minimum setback
distance if an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer certifies that an
alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic
pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design
proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe
from flooding, shall be submitted to the City for review. In no case shall the
setback distance be less than four feet (4').
   E.   Compacted Fill: The ground around the building shall be compacted fill
that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet (5')
thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be
interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as
part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar
classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC
or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for
Engineering Purposes.
   F.   Fill Material: The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic;
that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities
must be in the same direction.
   G.   Design, Certification, Inspection: All fill material and compaction
shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois Registered
Professional Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions.
   H.   Basement Floor Elevation: The basement floor shall be at an elevation
that is no more than five (5) below the BFE.
   I.   Drainage Layer: There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the
floor slab, and minimum of one-quarter (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup
power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated
at four (4) times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE
and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or
uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
   J.   Backflow Prevention: The drainage system shall be equipped with a
positive means of preventing backflow.
   K.   Foundation Elements: All foundation elements shall be designed to
withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering
practices.
   L.   Exceptions: If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements
set forth in the preceding subsections, the Building Officer may allow the
construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates
that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set
forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding.
In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from
flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the
proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be
completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-
01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois Registered
Professional Engineer.
   M.   Excavation Depth: In order to provide the required compensatory storage
on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards
of the lot exceed eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously
existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater
depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to
drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of
mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

(1987 Code § 8-7.3)
13-5-5: PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES; LIST OF APPROPRIATE USES:
   A.   Scope: The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are
appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and
which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity, or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare, or
impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or
channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this title. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Illinois
Administrative Code part 3708 will be allowed.
   B.   Approved Appropriate Uses: The approved appropriate uses are as
follows:
      1.   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
      2.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access
to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities and
facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
      3.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
      4.   Underground and overhead utilities;
      5.   Recreational facilities, such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any 1
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block flood
flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      6.   Detached garages, storage sheds or other nonhabitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage;
      7.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
      8.   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
         a.   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will
not exceed 1.0 foot; or
         b.   The applicant of a short term recreational use facility parking
lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and
accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank
flooding events;
      9.   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosion slope toward a watercourse;
      10.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures, including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure;
      11.   The replacement, reconstruction or repair of a damaged building;
provided, that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building
was damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the

enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows, including, but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios and second story additions. If the
building is improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before
the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will
be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
(1987 Code § 8-7.4)

fence) and storage of materials, except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
(1987 Code § 8-7.4a)
13-5-7: ENGINEERING AND MITIGATION CRITERIA:
Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate use will be
considered permissible; provided, that the proposed project meets the following
engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting
plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided
that any structure meets the protection requirements of chapter 7 of this
title:
   A.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages
Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on
stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
      1.   Designated floodway conveyance, “K” + (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where “n” is
Manning’s roughness factor, “A” is the effective flow area of the cross
section, and “R” is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, McGraw-Hill, New York 1959.)
      2.   The same Manning’s “n” value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a Federal,
State or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover.
      3.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of
effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
         a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream’s length.
         b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream’s length.
         c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream
length shall be used.
         d.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with
rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
         e.   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
   B.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream
Flooding:
      1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway
storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
      2.   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at
least one and one-half (1.5) times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
      3.   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss
behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
      4.   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between
the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All designated
floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
      5.   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of
the proposed construction, the applicant’s engineer shall demonstrate through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
      6.   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of
a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce at
existing structure.
   C.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream
Erosion Or Flood Heights:
      1.   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream
structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average
channel or designated floodway velocities or stage, for all flood events up to
and including the 100-year frequency event.
      2.   In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for
the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows,
velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
   D.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches: The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for
all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the
upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
      1.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated
using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater
conditions for the flood study specified in chapter 3 of this title. Bridges
and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA approved
hydraulic models.
      2.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection B of
this section.
      3.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection C of this
section.
      4.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
      5.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by section
13-5-5 of this chapter.
      6.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per subsection H of this section.
   E.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts And
Approach Roads:
      1.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
      2.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source
of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the
applicant’s engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
      3.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a
source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance
with 17 Illinois Administrative Code part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
   F.   On Stream Structures Built For Purpose Of Backing Up Water:
      1.   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 feet when
compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency event, shall be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements.
      2.   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
      3.   All dams and impoundment structures, as defined in section
13-1-2 of this title, shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Illinois
Administrative Code part 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the
proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
         a.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation or regional stormwater detention;
         b.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish
species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their cycle, such as
for spawning;
         c.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation basin;
         d.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
         e.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
chapter.
   G.   Flood Proofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures: If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities.
   H.   Excavation In The Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the design
of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement
of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance
for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the
excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless
an applicant’s engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations
or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same
efficiency:
      1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the
water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream’s length;
      2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the
water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream’s length; and
      3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream
length shall be used;
      4.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
   I.   Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
      1.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would
accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body
of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization,
floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a
stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if
the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish
and wildlife habitat.
      2.   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and not significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values.
      3.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed
in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of
the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match
as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section,
slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified,
restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into
channel modification design, where practical;
         b.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the
upstream and downstream ends of the project designed such that they will
prevent erosion;
         c.   One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible.
Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of
the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects
of the vegetation;
         d.   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which
is essential for construction of the channel;
         e.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper
than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives;
         f.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover;
         g.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity,
such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate;
         h.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the
modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality;
         i.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry, and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel;
         j.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel
enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated
by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as
part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project;
         k.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control project,
there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the
floodway as a result of the modification; and
         l.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
chapter.
   J.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
   K.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
      1.   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to the
initiation of improvements;
      2.   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to
denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion
of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not be at
final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days;
      3.   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches
and sediment traps and basins;
      4.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width
shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing
channels. Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary
stream crossings shall be constructed where necessary, to minimize erosion.
Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately;
      5.   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed
and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green
Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
   L.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects, the
permitting requirements of this chapter will be considered met if the applicant
can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that
the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased
flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
   M.   General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
      1.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in chapter 3 of this title, must be used for
analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or
conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and
concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use;
      2.   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet the requirements of this chapter for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the designated floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations;
      3.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
   N.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision:
      1.   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated
floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant
shall submit to IDNR/OWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued;
      2.   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until
as built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging or
excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR;
      3.   In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given;
      4.   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a
conditional approval is issued;
      5.   After initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
   O.   Professional Engineer Supervision: All engineering analyses shall be
performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer.
   P.   Construction Within Twenty Five Feet Of Channel: For all activities in
the floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25') of the
channel, the following criteria shall be met:
      1.   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least
twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel;
      2.   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
   Q.   Construction; Conditions: After receipt of conditional approval of the
designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision, construction as necessary to change the designated floodway
designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction
that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated
floodway map is changed and a final Letter of Map Revision is received. The
designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by
IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the as built plans.
