be.
   (Q)   Announcement and changes of votes. The result of all votes by yeas and

         (d)   When adjournment was the last preceding motion; and
         (e)   When it has been decided that the previous question shall be
taken.
      (2)   A motion simply to adjourn shall not be subject to amendment or
debate, but a motion to adjourn to a time certain shall be.
      (3)   The City Council may, at any time, adjourn over one or more regular
meetings, on a vote of a majority of all the Alderpersons authorized by law to
be elected.
   (T)   Previous question. When the previous question is moved on the main
question, and seconded, it shall be put on this form: “Shall the main question
now be put?” If such motion be carried, all further amendment and all further
motions and debate shall be excluded, and the question put without delay upon
the pending amendment in proper order and then upon the main question.
   (U)   Motions to lay on the table and to take from the table.
      (1)   A motion simply to lay the question on the table shall not be
debatable, but a motion to lay on the table and publish, or with any other
condition shall be subject to amendment and debate.
      (2)   A motion to take any motion or other proposition from the table may
be proposed at the same meeting at which such motion or proposition was laid
upon the table; provided two-thirds of the Alderpersons vote therefor.
      (3)   A motion to lay any particular motion or proposition on the table

      (2)   A motion to postpone indefinitely shall not open the main question
to debate.
      (3)   A motion to defer or postpone without any reference to time shall
not be construed as a motion to postpone indefinitely, but shall be considered
to be of the same general nature, and to possess the same general attributes so
far as applicable under these rules, as a motion to postpone indefinitely or to
a time certain.
   (W)   Motion to refer. A motion to refer to a standing committee shall take
precedence over a similar motion to refer to a special committee.

stricken out, then those to be inserted and finally, the paragraph as it will
stand if so amended shall be read.

referred to a committee and neither the main question nor such other pending

appertaining thereto.

reconsideration, having been once made and decided in the negative, shall not
be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be reconsidered.
      (2)   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by members who
voted on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless
otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that, where a motion has received
a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground
that a greater number of votes is required by statute for the passage or
adoption of such motion, then in such case, a motion to reconsider may be made
and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such question to be
reconsidered.
   (BB)   Adoption of “Robert’s Rules of Order Revised”. The rules of

they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with the special
rules of the City Council.
   (CC)   Temporary suspension of rules; amendment of rules. These rules may be

law to be elected and shall not be repealed, altered or amended, unless by
concurrence of two-thirds vote of all Alderpersons entitled by law to be

of the members present or expelled by a two-thirds vote of all members elected.

and, after one reading, read the same by title for the second reading and put

§ 31.069 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this investment policy (“this policy”) is to
formalize the framework for the investment activities of the city. This policy
applies to all of the city’s financial assets and is intended to be broad
enough to allow the city to function properly within the parameters of
responsibility and authority, while adequately safeguarding such assets. All
transactions involving the city’s financial assets and related activity shall
be administered and conducted in accordance with this policy.
   (B)   Responsibility.
      (1)   Governing body. The City Council shall retain ultimate fiduciary
responsibility. The City Council shall receive quarterly reports at the Finance
and Administration Committee meeting and shall approve changes to the
investment policy as recommended by the Investment Committee.
      (2)   Investment Officer. Authority to manage the investment program is
granted to the Director of Finance in consultation with the Investment
Committee, hereinafter referred to as “Investment Officer” as designated by 30
ILCS 235/2.5(a)(7). Management responsibility for the operation of the
investment program is hereby delegated to the Director of Finance.
   (C)   Rules and procedures.
      (1)   Scope.
         (a)   This policy applies to the investment activities of the city
with regard to the financial assets of all funds, with the following
exceptions.
            1.   The City Police Pension Fund is governed by the City Police
Pension Board and has a separate investment policy.
            2.   The City Fire Pension Fund is governed by the City Fire
Pension Board and has a separate investment policy.
            3.   The City Library Fund is governed by the Library Board who
make its own investment decisions.
            4.   Funds set aside to decrease city debt in conjunction with a
refunding agreement shall be invested in accordance with appropriate bond
documents and not necessarily in compliance with this policy. Should bond
covenants be more restrictive than this policy, funds shall be invested in full
compliance with those restrictions.
         (b)   The following funds are accounted for in the city’s
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (“audit”) and are covered under this
policy:
            1.   General Fund;
            2.   Special Revenue Funds;
            3.   Debt Service Funds;
            4.   Capital Project Funds;
            5.    Enterprise/Proprietary Funds; and
            6.   Any new fund created, unless specifically exempted above.
         (c)   Except for cash and investments in certain restricted and
special funds, the city commingles its cash and investments to maximize
investment earnings and to increase efficiencies with regard to pricing,
safekeeping and administration. Investment income will be allocated to the
various funds based on their respective participation and in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
      (2)   General objectives. The primary objectives (“objectives”), in order
of priority, of all investment activities involving the financial assets of the
city shall be as follows.
         (a)   Safety. Safety shall be the foremost objective of this policy
and refers to the preservation of capital and protection of investment
principal. City investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to
ensure the preservation of capital in the city’s overall portfolio by
mitigating credit and interest rate risk.
            1.   Credit risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt
security will not pay its par value upon maturity. The goal shall be to
minimize credit risk by:
               a.    Limiting investments to the types of securities identified
in division (C)(6) below; and
               b.    Diversifying the portfolio in accordance with division (C)
(8) below, so that potential losses on individual securities will be minimized.
Diversification reduces the risk that potential losses on individual securities
might exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio.
            2.   Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that
changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an
investment. The goal shall be to minimize interest rate risk by:
               a.    Structuring the portfolio so that securities mature to
meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to
sell securities on the open market prior to maturity; and
               b.    Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term
securities, money markets or similar investment pools.
         (b)   Liquidity. The portfolio shall maintain sufficient liquidity to
enable the city to meet all operating requirements and expected liabilities
which may be reasonably anticipated in any city fund. This is accomplished by
structuring the portfolio so that securities or other allowable investments
mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands. Furthermore,
since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should
provide adequate liquidity to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity can be
achieved utilizing securities with active secondary markets, money market
accounts and/or savings deposit accounts offering daily liquidity or other
liquid options acceptable under state statute.
         (c)   Return on investments. The portfolio shall be designed to obtain
a reasonable return, which for the purposes of this policy means the portfolio
should obtain a market-average rate of return in accordance with division (C)
(11) below, taking into account the city’s investment risk constraints and cash
flow needs of the city’s funds.
      (3)   Standards of care.
         (a)   Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment
officials shall be the “prudent person” standard and shall be applied in the
context of managing an overall portfolio. Investments and deposits of public
funds shall be made with judgment and care under the circumstances then
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in
the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment,
considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income
to be derived. City officers and employees acting in accordance with this
policy, and any other written procedures, and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal liability for an individual security’s credit risk or
market changes; provided that officers and employees report deviations from
expectations in a timely fashion and take appropriate action to control adverse
developments.
         (b)   Maintaining the public trust. All participants in the investment
process shall seek to act responsibly as custodians of the public trust and
shall avoid any transaction that might impair public confidence in the city.
         (c)   Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees of the
city who are involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal
business activity that could conflict with proper execution and management of
the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial
investment decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose to the
City Council any material interests in financial institutions with which they
conduct business. They shall further disclose any material personal financial
or investment positions that could be related to the performance of the
portfolio. Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment
transactions to those of the city, particularly with regard to the timing of
purchases and sales.
      (4)   Authorized financial institutions.
         (a)   Financial institutions may include depositories, investment
advisors, broker/dealers and local government investment pools as authorized in
this policy. Financial institutions who desire to become qualified for
transactions must provide certification of having read and understood this
policy, agree to comply with this policy and ensure all investments proposed
for purchase shall conform to this policy and applicable state statutes.
Selection of financial institutions authorized to engage in transactions with
the city shall be at the sole discretion of the city. Financial institutions
shall be selected based on financial condition, proper registration, level of
service, experience with state municipalities and competitive pricing. Whenever
possible, the city shall maintain operating and investment accounts in
financial institutions within the city.
         (b)   All depositories shall be insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the National Credit Union Administration
(“NCUA”) and may consist of banks, savings and loan associations and credit
unions. All financial institutions who desire to become designated depositories
must supply the following (as appropriate):
            1.   Audited financial statements;
            2.   Proof of state registration; and
            3.   Evidence of adequate insurance coverage.
         (c)   All investment advisors shall be registered under the Investment
Advisors Act of 1940, being 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-1 et seq. All financial
institutions who desire to become designated investment advisors must supply
the following (as appropriate):

of nationally recognized expertise in rating bonds of states and their
political subdivisions.
         (c)   The amount of collateral provided shall not be less than 110% of
the market value of the net amount of public funds secured. The ratio of fair

ten days prior to any proposed substitutions and provided that the market value
of the replacement securities are equal or greater than the market value of the
securities being replaced. The city must pre-approve all substitution and
exchanges of securities.
      (8)   Diversification.
         (a)   It is the policy of the city to diversify its portfolio.
Investments shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss and balance the
effect of interest rate changes on different types of securities. Investment
shall be diversified by:
            1.   Limiting investments to avoid over-concentration in securities
from a specific issuer;
            2.   Investing in securities with varying maturities; and
            3.   Investing a portion of the portfolio in readily available
funds such as bank cash management accounts, money market funds, State Funds or
IMET Convenience Fund to ensure liquidity is maintained to meet ongoing
obligations.
         (b)   With the exception of United States Treasury and United States
agency securities, as well as State Investment Pools, no more than 50% of the
city’s total investment portfolio shall be invested in a single security type
and no more than 50% of the city’s total investment portfolio shall be invested
with a single financial institution. It is understood this goal is for
investment planning purposes and may not be achieved or maintained when
adherence to the 50% goal would create a cost (penalty) by reallocating funds
within a portfolio solely to comply with the 50% goal.
      (9)   Maximum maturities. To the extent possible, the city shall attempt
to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless
matched to a specific cash flow, the city shall not directly invest in
securities maturing more than three years from the date of purchase. However,
reserve funds may be invested in securities exceeding three years if the
maturities of such investments are made to coincide as nearly as practicable
with the expected use of the funds.
      (10)   Internal controls. The Director of Finance shall establish a
system of internal controls, which shall be documented in writing. The controls
shall be designed to prevent the loss of public funds arising from fraud,
employee error and misrepresentation by third-parties, unanticipated changes in
financial markets or imprudent action by officers and employees of the city.
      (11)   Performance standards. The portfolio will be managed in accordance
with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a
market average rate of return during budgetary and economic cycles, taking into
account the city’s investment risk constraints and cash flow needs. The city’s
investment strategy is passive, which means securities are intended to be held
to maturity. Given this strategy, the investment portfolio of the city shall be
designed with the general objective of regularly exceeding the average return
of the State Funds, money market daily rate. The investment program shall seek
to augment returns above this level, consistent with risk limitations
identified herein and prudent investment principles.
      (12)   Reporting.
         (a)   Quarterly. The Director of Finance shall submit a cash and
investment report to the Finance Committee which lists the individual
components of the portfolio by maturity date, valuation by fund and rate of
return. In addition, the Director of Finance shall ensure that the portfolio is
reviewed to determine its general performance and effectiveness in meeting the
objectives.
         (b)   Annually. The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (“audit”) of
the city shall include all investment information and disclosures required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as promulgated by
the Government Accounting Standards Board.
      (13)   Amendment of policy.
         (a)   The Investment Committee shall review this policy from time to
time and shall submit any modifications thereto to the Council for approval.
         (b)   In the event that any state or federal legislation or regulation
should further restrict instruments, institutions or procedures authorized by
this policy, such restrictions shall be deemed to be immediately incorporated
in this policy. If new legislation or regulation should liberalize the
permitted instruments, institutions or procedures, such changes shall be
available and included in this policy only after written notification to the
Council and its subsequent approval of said changes.
   (D)   Legislation and documentation.
      (1)   The city’s investment program shall comply, at all times, with the
State Public Funds Investment Act (30 ILCS 235/1 et seq.) and other state laws
governing the investment of public funds, as amended from time to time. In the
event of any conflict between this policy and the State Public Funds Investment
Act and other state laws, the provisions of the State Public Funds Investment
Act and other state laws shall control.
      (2)   The Director of Finance shall maintain a list of all authorized
financial institutions and dealers/brokers and is hereby authorized to deposit
city monies, in accordance with 65 ILCS 5/3.1-35-50. The Director of Finance
shall review this list from time to time and shall submit any modifications
made to this list to the Investment Committee. The Director of Finance shall be
discharged from responsibility for all funds or money the Director of Finance
deposits in a designated financial institution while the funds and money are so
deposited.
   (E)   Investment Committee.
      (1)   An investment committee shall be formed consisting of the City
Treasurer, Director of Finance, City Administrator, Chairperson of the Finance
and Administration Committee and the Mayor. This Committee shall meet as
needed, but no less than semi-annually, to determine general strategies and
monitor results. The Investment Committee shall include in its deliberations
such topics as: economic outlook, portfolio diversification, maturity
structure, potential risks to funds, authorized depositories, brokers and
dealers and target rate of return on the investment portfolio as well as
reviewing RFPs submitted. After its deliberations, the Investment Committee
shall make investment decisions.
      (2)   Investment Committee members shall refrain from personal business
activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program or
which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions
Committee members shall disclose to the Mayor any material financial interests
in financial institutions that conduct business within this jurisdiction. They
shall further disclose any personal financial investment positions that could
be related to the performance of the city’s portfolio. Committee members shall
subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of the city,
particularly with regard to the time of purchases and sales.
   (F)   Competitive bidding. The Investment Committee shall make determination
of the bidding process required for obtaining competitive bids. The Investment
Committee, in compliance with the purchasing policy, may require a formal RFP
process or an informal process, but in any event, no less than three bids/
quotes will be obtained from the authorized financial institution/broker/dealer
list. The investment will be awarded to the highest bidder as determined by the
net return to the city. In the event of tied bids or highest bids totaling more
than the face value to be invested, awards of investment will be made first to
bidders with offices in the city and then pro rata among other highest bidders.
The Director of Finance shall maintain a record of all bids/quotes received and
shall make available to the Investment Committee a list showing the bidders,
the bids/quotes received and amount awarded.

shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made
by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure
application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator.

§ 35.111 COLLECTION.
   The tax authorized by this subchapter shall be collected from the purchaser
by the person maintaining a place of business in the state who delivers the
electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser
to the person who delivers the electricity of the purchaser and, if unpaid, is
recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the
electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to this subchapter and
any such tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a
debt owed to the city by such person delivering electricity. Persons delivering
electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding such tax to the
gross charge for delivering the electricity and taxes so collected shall be
remitted to the city monthly. Persons delivering electricity shall also be
authorized to add to such gross charge an amount equal to 3% of the tax to
reimburse the person delivering electricity for the expense incurred in keeping
records, billing customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and
supplying data to the city upon request. If the person delivering electricity
fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser shall pay the
tax monthly, directly to the city in the manner prescribed by the city. Persons
delivering electricity who file returns pursuant to this section shall, at the
time of filing such return, pay the city the amount of the tax collected
pursuant to §
35.105.

consuming gas in the city that is purchased in a sale at retail.

billed by the public utility, but not actually collected from a retail
purchaser.

vitrified clay sewer pipe, ASTM specification (C-13-59T) or equal (or most
current ASTM designation); or other suitable material approved by the City
Engineer. Joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer
that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of
cast iron soil pipe with leaded joints or equal substitute. Cast iron pipe with
leaded joints may be required by the City Engineer where the building sewer is
exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled, unstable ground, the
building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe; except that non-metallic
material may be accepted if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as
approved by the City Engineer.
   (B)   Size and slope of building sewer. The size and slope of the building
sewer shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer, but in no event
shall the diameter be less than six inches. The slope of such six-inch pipe
shall be not less than one-eighth inch per foot. For larger sizes of pipe, the
minimum slopes shall be according to all state and local regulations.
   (C)   Elevation.
      (1)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be
laid parallel to any bearing wall if within three feet of any wall, which might
thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from
frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight
alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction or grade shall be allowed
only when a proper manhole is constructed at the location of the change.
      (2)   On all buildings for which the sanitary sewer drainage is to be
conveyed by gravity to the sewer main, the lowest floor to be served shall be a
minimum of three feet above the top of the sanitary sewer main. In all
buildings in which the lower floor is too low to permit the gravity flow to the
public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by
an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. The pumped sewage shall
be connected to the gravity system of the building, at an elevation not less
than three feet above the top of the sanitary sewer main.
   (D)   Lifting of sanitary sewage. In all buildings in which any building
drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage
carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and
discharged to the building sewer.
   (E)   Joints and connections.
      (1)   All joints and connections shall be made gas-tight and water-tight.
All cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or hemp and filled
with molten lead, federal specification (QQ- L156) or most current federal
specification not less than one inch deep. Lead shall be run in one pouring and
caulked tight. No paint, varnish or other coatings shall be permitted on the
jointing material until after the joint has been tested and approved.
      (2)   All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between such pipe and metals
shall be made with approved hot-poured jointing material, approved rubber
gaskets, oakum and Sewertite, Am-Vit or an approved equal method and material.
      (3)   Material for hot-poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to
destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of
160°F, nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried by the drainage system. The
joints shall first be caulked tight with jute, hemp or similar approved
material. Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval of
the City Engineer.

§ 51.042 CONNECTION TO PUBLIC SEWER.
   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at
the “Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the
public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located “Y”
branch is available, the owner shall, at his or her expense, install a “Y”
branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the City Engineer.
Where the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly
located “Y” branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer
to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an
angle at about 45 degrees. A 45-degree ell may be used to make such connection,
with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the
public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall
be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer,
but no higher than a point one-half the vertical distance between the invert
and the crown of the sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the
connection made secure and water-tight by encasement in concrete. Special
fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the City
Engineer. Manholes shall be constructed at any junction of an eight-inch
diameter line or larger into a public sewer.

   Sewer service rates of the city shall be as follows.
   (A)   There shall be and there are hereby established monthly rates and
charges for the use of and the service supplied by the sewerage system of the
city, such rates and charges hereby established being as follows.
      (1)   Sewer service rates. Effective October 1, 2019, the sewer service
rate shall be $16.40 for the first 1,000 gallons, plus an additional $10.15 for
each 1,000 gallons of wastewater per month. The minimum monthly charge shall be
$7.80. Where wastewater flow is recorded in a control manhole required by §
51.063, the sewer service rate shall be $16.40 for the first 1,000 gallons,
plus an additional $10.15 for each 1,000 gallons of wastewater per month as
recorded in the control manhole. If no control manhole is present to record
wastewater flow at a point of service, wastewater flow shall be determined by
the amount of water used, unless other sections of this chapter are applicable
for determining flow or cost of sanitary sewer service.
      (2)   Surcharge for industrial users.
         (a)   Effective January 1, 2020, the following is the procedure for
determining an industrial user surcharge:
            1.   Obtain representative B.O.D. and suspended solids
concentrations in the waste. This may require 24-hour composite sampling for
one or more days;
            2.   B.O.D. surcharge equals (B.O.D. — 200) x number of million
gallons used x 8.33 x $0.16 per pound;
            3.   Suspended solids (“SS”) surcharge equals (SS — 250) x number
of million gallons used x 8.33 x $0.21;
            4.   Total phosphorus (“TP”) surcharge equals (TP — 10) x number of
million gallons used x 8.33 x $4.24 per pound;
            5.   Total nitrogen (“TN”) surcharge equals (TN — 40) x number of
million gallons used x 8.33 x $0.93 per pound;
            6.   Zinc (“Z”) surcharge equals (Z — 0.05) x number of million
gallons used x 8.33 x $174.10 per pound;
            7.   The above surcharges are added monthly to the sewer service
rate; and
            8.   The surcharge rates shall be adjusted on each annual
anniversary, beginning January 2021, based upon the O’Fallon Wastewater
Treatment Facility organic surcharge determination calculation.
         (b)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
water and wastes to determine the industrial user surcharge factors shall be
conducted in conformation with §
51.064.
   (B)   All commercial and industrial users of the sewerage system of the city
who do not use the water services of the city shall be required to install a
control manhole as required by §
51.063 equipped with a metering device approved by the City Engineer which
records the total sewage flow for the purpose of determining the basis for user
charges as provided by division (A) above.
   (C)   The sewer service rate shall be subject to increase effective on each
annual anniversary, beginning October 2021, based upon the annual increase in
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, U.S.
City Average, Water and Sewer Maintenance, or comparable index if the same is
no longer published, for the month of May.
   (D)   The rates for the summer billing periods for residential users shall
be the average of the previous three quarters sewer charges.

§ 51.088 SEWER EXPANSION AND EXTENSION FEE.
   (A)   The sewer expansion and extension fee is hereby established to
reimburse the city for its costs in extending sewer lines to serve new and
additional users and to increase its capacity to transport and treat sewage.
The city may provide, at its own initial expense, for the increase in size of
its sewage treatment plant and the extension and expansion of its sewer mains
to certain areas within the city. In so doing, the city seeks to provide a
material benefit to the property owners abutting such improvements and to
encourage the development of such property. To reimburse the city for the funds
so expended, the city hereby has created a sewer expansion and extension fee.
Such fee shall be based upon the pro rata share of the cost of said
construction and extension which cost was required to provide the sewer
services being made available to the new or additional user. The sewer
expansion and extension fee shall be based upon all costs, including, but not
limited to, engineering fees, supervision, legal fees, land costs and
construction. For currently existing residences, a benefitted property owner
may, by so indicating in writing to the City Engineer, cause the sewer
expansion and extension fee to be billed to him or her over a three-year period
at an interest rate based on the city’s ability to borrow money at that time,
plus 0.5%, as an addition to the regular sewer charge bill amortized in such a
way that he or she shall make 36 equal payments. In the absence of such written
notification, the sewer expansion and extension fee is due and payable by the
property owner of presently existing residences prior to the time of the
connection of the individual premises to the city’s sewer main.
   (B)   The expansion and extension fee will normally be based on the portion
of land occupied by the new or additional user (in developable acres only)
divided by the total land area that could be reasonably serviced by the
expansion and extension (in developable acres only) multiplied by the total
cost of the expansion and extension as described above as approved by the
Council. However, the City Engineer may propose an alternate expansion and
extension fee if appropriate and reasonable. Such alternate expansion and
extension fee as it pertains to each new or additional user shall be approved
by the Council.

held responsible or liable for any direct or resulting damage because of
interrupted supply, insufficient pressure or otherwise.
      (3)   Whenever water mains, pipes and service connections are taken up,
shut off or interfered with by reason of any city street improvements, the city
will endeavor to maintain service so far as reasonably possible, but will not
be directly or indirectly liable for any interruption, poor pressure or damage
of any kind either to consumers adjacent or to other consumers affected
thereby.
      (4)   The city expressly stipulates with all its consumers and other
persons that it will not insure or be responsible or liable, in any manner, for
any losses or damages, direct or resultant, by reason of any fire, and all

inevitable accidents, fire, strikes, riots, war or any other cause not within
the reasonable control of the city.
   (B)   The city shall not be held responsible for, or in any manner liable
to, any person, company, consumer or public body, for any claim or damage,
either direct or resultant, because any shortage of water supply; any shut-off

§ 52.009 EXTRATERRITORIAL SERVICE.
   The city may, but shall in no event be obligated to, extend or maintain
water service outside its municipal boundaries, and such service may be
terminated by the city at any time. In order to ensure the orderly development
of the city and use of city infrastructure and services, after the effective
date of this section, water service provision and extension may be granted at
the discretion of the city subject to the following minimum requirements.
   (A)   New extensions or service. New service shall not be extended or
commenced outside the boundaries of the city to any property unless such
property is annexed into the city by means of an annexation petition and
agreement; or if not then capable of annexation, subject to an annexation
agreement, all requiring compliance with the city’s ordinances and
requirements; provided that if the property is located in another incorporated
city or village, such service may be extended only pursuant to a service
agreement conforming with city requirements.
   (B)   Continued extraterritorial service. Service outside the city
boundaries shall hereinafter be maintained only as follows.
      (1)   Residential dwellings. Within 60 days of mailing of notice to the
owners of residential dwellings receiving city water service outside the city

and submit to the City Clerk either an acceptable annexation agreement and
annexation petition if contiguous to the city, or an acceptable annexation
agreement if not contiguous to the city, in all cases conforming with the
requirements of the city. It shall be deemed a condition of continued service
under any service agreement that, if requested by the city, the property owner
shall submit an acceptable annexation agreement and annexation petition if
contiguous to the city, or an acceptable annexation agreement if not contiguous
to the city. Within 30 days of receipt of notice by the city of these
requirements, each such owner shall notify the city if such continued service
is requested as provided herein and to obtain from the city the required
documents to be executed.
      (2)   Other properties. Within 30 days of mailing of notice to the owners
of properties other than residential dwellings governed by division (B)(1)

requirements, each such owner shall notify the city if such continued service
is requested as provided herein and to obtain from the city the required
documents to be executed.
      (3)   Council approval. Nothing herein shall require the city to accept
any annexation agreement, annexation petition or service agreement not deemed
by the City Council in the public interest, or otherwise provide service
outside the boundary of the city; provided, however, that service shall not be
denied, terminated or maintained on any unlawful discriminatory basis.
      (4)   Notice; termination of service. Each owner of properties receiving
service outside the boundaries of the city shall be given written notice of the
requirements of this section. Such notice shall contain a statement providing
that service shall be terminated without further notice if the requirements for
future service are not satisfied as set forth herein. In the event that a
property owner does not submit all required documents within the required time
frame, or violates the provisions thereof, the service shall be terminated
immediately thereafter.
      (5)   Variances; extensions. The require-ments set forth herein may be
varied and deadlines extended for good cause or undue hardship by application
to the City Council in writing.

§ 52.022 TAPS AND WATER SERVICE CONNECTIONS; COSTS AND INSTALLATION.
   (A)   For all taps and service connections, the city will furnish the tap
and service pipe connections, curb cock, curb box and meter at the following
rates, except as noted.
      (1)   Specific rates.
Tap Rate
Tap                             Rate
3/4 in. or 5/8 in. tap          $2,750
1 in. tap                       $3,000
1-1/2 in. tap                   $4,500
2 in. tap                       $5,000
3 in. tap                       $5,000
4 in. tap                       $8,500
6 in. tap                       $13,000
Fire sprinkler tap* (all sizes) $5,000
Notes to Table:
* Waived for single and double dwelling residential construction.
 
      (2)   Rates for larger taps. Fees for taps larger than six inches will be
determined by the City Engineer. All taps shall meet the minimum size
requirements per the State Plumbing Code or its successor document.
      (3)   Additional fees. In addition to the fees as set forth in divisions
(A)(1) and (A)(2) above, a water expansion and extension fee is hereby
established to reimburse the city for its costs in extending the water system
to serve new and additional users and to increase the city’s capacity to
distribute water through its water system. The city may provide, at its own
initial expense, for the extension and expansion of its water system within and
outside the city boundaries. In so doing, the city seeks to provide a material
benefit to the property owners abutting such improvements and to encourage the
development of such property. To reimburse the city for the funds so expended,
the city hereby has created a water expansion and extension fee. Such fee shall
be based upon the pro rata share of the cost of said construction and extension
which cost was required to provide the water services being made available to
the new or additional user. The water expansion and extension fee shall be
based upon all costs, including, but not limited to, engineering fees,
supervision, legal fees, land costs and construction. For currently existing
residences/businesses, a benefitted property owner may, by so indicating in
writing to the City Engineer, cause the water expansion and extension fee to be
billed to him or her over a three-year period at an interest rate based on the
city’s ability to borrow money at that time, plus 0.5% as an addition to the
regular water charge bill amortized in such a way that he or she shall make 36
equal payments. In the absence of such written notification, the water
expansion and extension fee is due and payable by the property owner of
presently existing residence/businesses prior to the time of the connection of
the individual premises to the city’s water main.
      (4)   Fee base. The expansion and extension fee will normally be based on
the portion of land occupied by the new or additional user (in developable
acres only) divided by the total land area that could be reasonably serviced by
the expansion and extension (in developable acres only) multiplied by the total
cost of the expansion and extension as described above as approved by the City
Council. However, the City Engineer may propose an alternate expansion and
extension fee if appropriate and reasonable. Such alternate expansion and
extension fee as it pertains to each new or additional user shall be approved
by the City Council.
   (B)   The city will install all taps up to and including two inches in size
and provide all labor and materials from the water main to the meter pit. The
customer will be responsible for providing all materials (including a meter
compatible with the city water system) and labor for installing all taps over
two inches in size and fire sprinkler taps in accordance with all three of the
following stipulations.
      (1)   All taps over two inches in size shall be inspected by city
personnel during all stages of the installation process and all tap fees shall
be paid in full prior to the installation. A licensed plumber shall be provided
by the customer to install the tap and shall be on site at all times during the
tap.
      (2)   All taps two inches in size or larger shall be provided with an
approved backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of §
52.064 and shall be installed in accordance with the details set forth by the
City Engineering Department;
      (3)   All taps over two inches in size shall be scheduled at least three
working days in advance in order to allow for sufficient advance notice for
inspection; and
      (4)   All taps shall be made during regular business hours.
   (C)   For multiple dwelling (apartment, dormitory, institutional housing,
assisted living, nursing home) units, mobile home courts or mobile home parks,
a single master meter shall be installed to serve the entire development. The
tap fee shall be $1,000 for each dwelling unit. The tap fee for the entire
development shall be due and payable prior to the installation of the master
meter. The City Engineer shall determine where the master meter will be
located. The city reserves the right to apply the single-family tap procedures
to multi-dwelling units where each unit is separately owned.
   (D)   For hotels and motels, a single master meter shall be installed for
each hotel/motel. The tap fee shall be $3,000, plus $500 per guest room.

or service connections within 21 calendar days after the date that the
applicant has submitted the written application and paid the fee provided for
in §§
52.020 and
52.022 due to the refusal of city employees to provide such taps or service
connections, the city shall have seven more calendar days to use its best
efforts to arrange for such water taps or service connections to be made by a
plumbing contractor licensed in the state and acceptable to the city. If,
during that seven-day period, the city is unable to secure a plumbing
contractor for the construction of the water taps or service connections, then
the applicant may arrange for such water taps or service connections to be made
by its employees licensed in the state pursuant to 225 ILCS 320/0.01 through
43, or by an independent contractor licensed in the state, pursuant to 225 ILCS
320/0.01 through 43. If this section applies, then the city shall provide,
promptly upon demand by the applicant, the following items: water meter; water
meter yoke; water meter box, including the appropriate lids; an appropriate
puncture tool; and any other material or tool necessary to provide and complete
the taps or connections. Further, if this section applies, the city shall
refund, within five days after that seven-day period, that portion of the fee
paid by the applicant pursuant to §
52.022 which does not constitute material or parts cost of the city for the
above items.

§ 52.059 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL POLICY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these rules and regulations is:
      (1)   To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the customer’s water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system;
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer’s potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable safety; and
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public and consumer’s potable water systems.
   (B)   Application. These rules and regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water supply system of the city.
   (C)   Policy. The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or back-siphonage of contaminants through the customer’s water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the City Engineer or his or her authorized
representative, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the
safety of the public water supply system, the City Engineer shall give notice
to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention device at each
service connection to the premises. The consumer shall immediately install such
approved device or devices at his or her own expense; failure, refusal or
inability on the part of the consumer to install such device or devices
immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the
premises until such device or devices have been installed. The consumer shall
retain records of installation, maintenance, testing and repair as required in
§
52.067 for a period of at least five years. The City Engineer may require the
consumer to submit a cross-connection inspection report to the city to assist
in determining whether or not service line protection will be required. All
cross-connection inspections shall be conducted by a cross-connection control
device inspector certified by the State Environmental Protection Agency.

WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS
§ 52.105 APPLICATION.
   Any person, firm or corporation having an interest in real estate within the
service areas of the water system and desiring the extension of water mains to
the premises shall make application therefor to the City Clerk and, in making
the application, shall present to the City Clerk a plat showing the area to be
served by the water main extension.
(Prior Code, § 52.105)
§ 52.106 REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The plat shall be submitted by the City Clerk to the Director of
Public Works for determination of the size and lengths of water main
installation, location of fire hydrants, water service valves and other
appurtenances to be installed based upon the following requirements.
      (1)   Mains shall be sized so that fire protection service may be
rendered to all lots or premises to be served by the main and any possible
extension thereof.
      (2)   Fire hydrants shall be so located that no premises will be more
than 400 feet from a fire hydrant.
      (3)   In determining the length of pipe lines to be installed to serve a
subdivision or main extension, the main shall be extended to fully cover the
front of the property and if the last lot to be served is a corner lot or a lot
immediately adjacent to a corner lot, the terminal point of the extension made
hereunder shall be located so that the main laid hereunder ties with the
existing main located in the intersecting street; and further provided that if
there is no main located on the intersecting street, or no intersecting street,
the terminal point of the extension made hereunder shall be located at the
nearest street line of the intersecting street, or extend to the furthest end
of the development.
      (4)   The city may require the proposed main to be connected to its
distribution system at a point which, in its judgment, is necessary to
adequately furnish water to premises to be served and nothing herein shall
require the city to allow connection to the closest point of existing service,
if such service is inadequate for the extension proposed. Main trunk lines may
be installed by the city at no cost to the developer, however, lots or
properties fronting directly thereon which may be served by a service
connection to the main will be charged the average amount per connection as
found in subdivisions currently being constructed.
      (5)   The city reserves the right to further extend its water mains from
and beyond the terminus of each water main extension made under this chapter.
The applicant or the applicant’s agent paying for an extension shall not be
entitled to any refund for the attaching of customers to any further extension
or branch mains so involved.
      (6)   Extensions made under this rule shall be and remain the property of
the city.
      (7)   Before the city mains will be laid hereunder in any new
subdivision, it is understood and agreed that the road surface will be brought
to the extended sub-grade and the applicant developer of such new subdivision
shall furnish the city with a right-of-way agreement in suitable form to the
city, unless the streets of the new subdivision have been dedicated to public
use.
      (8)   When a pipe line is to be installed in a paved or unpaved street, a
service line of three-fourths-inch Type “K” copper is to be provided to the
centerline of each lot for a one-family dwelling. The service line is to
terminate at a point three to five feet inside the property line in a meter
box.
   (B)   When a business or an apartment house is to be serviced, one should
contact the Water Department to obtain the proper size for the service.
(Prior Code, § 52.106) (Ord. 3784, passed 12-3-2012)

§ 52.108 SEALED BIDS; DEPOSIT BY APPLICANT.
   Sealed bids shall be received by the City Council after advertisement not
less than ten days prior to the date of the receiving of the bids, and after
receipt thereof, the applicant shall deposit with the City Clerk the entire
cost, based upon the lowest responsible bid, the cost to include the entire
cost of the proposed extension, including pipes, valves, fittings, fire
hydrants, all other material and all costs of engineering and inspection.
Excepting that if the city should require the installation of a size of pipe
larger than is found by the city engineering standard to be necessary for the
subdivision, the deposit shall be based upon the cost of installing the size
determined to be necessary for the subdivision, with the city standing the
additional cost for a larger line.
(Prior Code, § 52.108)

§ 53.01 PURPOSE; SCOPE; APPLICABILITY; PRESCRIPTION.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. Except as provided by applicable
law, this chapter shall apply to all excavations, use, construction, operation
and maintenance of facilities or structures in the rights-of-way by any person
other than the city. No utility shall commence or continue with the operation
of any facilities or structures in the rights-of-way, except as provided and in
compliance with this chapter.
   (D)   Franchise or license required.
      (1)   Franchise. Except as may be otherwise provided by law, no utility
may construct, maintain, own, control or use facilities or structures in the
rights-of-way without a binding lawful franchise with the city granting the
privilege of locating such facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under,
across or within the city’s rights-of-way. In the event of any conflict with,
or inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of
any franchise, the provisions of such franchise shall govern and control during
the term of such franchise, and any lawful renewal or extension thereof
authorized by the city. All utilities claiming to be engaged in the sale of
telecommunications at retail pursuant to 35 ILCS 636/5-1 et seq. must so state
by verified application, and provide the city with the applicable resale number
as provided in 35 ILCS 636/5-45(a).
      (2)   License for incidental use. Persons desiring to install facilities
qualifying as merely an incidental use, which includes installation of
temporary structures or minor incidental uses in the rights-of-way, such as
mailboxes, driveway aprons, ingress or egress facilities and similar incidental
uses, that utilize a small area of the rights-of-way and serves the principal
structure, may be permitted without a franchise pursuant to a license issued by
the Director. The Director shall have discretion to establish such application,
requirements and conditions applicable to such uses consistent with the
purposes of this chapter or as otherwise established by law. Any person granted
a license hereunder shall be subject to the applicable requirements of this
chapter.
   (E)   Grant and nature of approval; terms and compensation. The authority
granted by the city in franchise or license shall be for non-exclusive use of
the rights-of-way. Such grant does not in any way limit the continuing
authority of the city through the proper exercise of its statutory powers to
adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to provide for the health, safety and
welfare of the public. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at
any time, such additional agreements or other rights to use the rights-of-way
for any purpose and to any other person, including itself, as it deems
appropriate, subject to all applicable laws. The granting of any franchise or
license shall not be deemed to create any property interest of any kind in
favor of the person, nor shall it create any relationship of agency,
partnership, joint venture or employment between the parties. Except as
provided in §
53.03(G), all franchises shall be approved by ordinance or resolution of the
City Council on a nondiscriminatory basis; provided that the utility is in
compliance with all applicable requirements. All licenses may be approved by
the Director on a nondiscriminatory basis; provided that the applicant is in
compliance with all applicable requirements. Each franchise and license shall
include terms of use and be deemed to incorporate the terms of this chapter and
other applicable laws of the city, except as may be expressly stated in such
franchise or license. Franchise compensation and terms shall be as provided in
this code or as may be otherwise lawfully established in the franchise.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws; preemption. No provision of
this chapter shall apply to any circumstance in which such application shall be
unlawful under superseding state or federal law. Furthermore, if any section,
division, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter is now or in the
future superseded or preempted by state or federal law, or found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unauthorized, that provision shall be
automatically interpreted and applied as required by law. In the event that
applicable state or federal laws or regulations conflict with the requirements
of this chapter, the person or utility shall comply with the requirements of
this chapter, to the maximum extent possible without violating state or federal
laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards, conditions
and requirements expressed in this chapter when the city so determines. Nothing
herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city to regulate its
rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
   (I)   No warranty. The city makes no express or implied representation or
warranty regarding its rights to authorize the installation or construction of
facilities on any particular segment of rights-of-way and shall not be liable
for any damage therefrom. The burden and responsibility for making all such
determinations in advance of construction or installation shall be entirely
upon the utility. Such utility shall be wholly liable for any damages to
facilities or other property due to excavation, facilities construction or
other ROW work performed prior to obtaining the location of all facilities,
without cost or liability to the city. No person shall make or attempt to make
repairs, relocation or replacement of damaged or disturbed facilities or uses
without the approval of the owner of such facilities.
   (J)   Use of city or third-party facilities. No franchise or license shall
be deemed to grant the right to use facilities or other property owned or
controlled by the city or a third party, and no such use shall occur, without
the express written consent of such party (on file with the city and subject to
other applicable requirements), nor shall any franchise or license excuse such
person from first obtaining a pole attachment agreement or other express
consent for such right or use before locating on the facilities controlled or
owned by the city or a third party.
   (K)   Lease required for public lands. Unless otherwise provided, use or
installation of any facilities in non-rights-of-way public property of the city
shall be permitted only if a lease agreement or other separate written approval
has been negotiated and approved by the city, with such reasonable terms as the
city may require.
   (L)   Condition precedent to permit. Unless otherwise required by applicable
law, no permit required by this chapter may be issued unless or until such
person has a valid franchise or license with the city that authorizes that
person’s use of the rights-of-way. Unless prohibited by applicable law, in
addition to any other reason provided herein, the Director may deny a permit to
any person that does not have a valid franchise or license with the city.
   (M)   Transferability. Except as provided in this chapter or as otherwise
required by law, no franchise, license or permit may be transferred or assigned
to a third party without the written application to, and consent of the city,
based on the requirements and policies of this chapter. The city shall not
unreasonably withhold its consent as provided herein, but any costs incurred
shall be paid by the utility to the extent allowed by law.
   (N)   Forfeiture of agreement and privilege. In case of failure on the part
of the person or utility, including its successors and assigns, to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter, or the provisions of franchise or
license, or if the person or utility, its successors and assigns, should do or
cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of this
chapter, or the terms of the authorization of such use, or otherwise loses
authority to provide its service in the city, the person or utility, its
successors and assigns, shall forfeit all rights and privileges permitted by
this chapter and any franchise or license, and all rights hereunder shall
cease, terminate and become null and void; provided that the forfeiture shall
not take effect until the city shall carry out the following proceedings.
      (1)   Before the city declares the forfeiture or revocation of a
franchise or license, it shall first serve a written notice upon the person,
setting forth, in detail, the neglect or failure complained of.
      (2)   The person shall have 30 days thereafter, or such other reasonable
period established by the City Council, in which to cure the default by
complying with the conditions of the franchise or license, and fully remedying
any default or violation.
      (3)   If, at the end of such period, the city determines that the
conditions have not been complied with, and that the person did not reasonably
and in the public interest require more than 30 days to cure the default, the
city shall take action by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at
the meeting, and voting to terminate the franchise or license, setting out the
grounds upon which the agreement or other authorization is to be forfeited or
revoked.
      (4)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from invoking any other
remedy or from declaring immediate forfeiture where the default is incapable of
being cured by the utility, including where such defaults or violations have
repeatedly occurred.
   (O)   No cause of action against the city. A person or utility shall have no
damages remedy or monetary recourse whatsoever against the city for any loss,
cost, expense or damage arising from any of the provisions or requirements of
any franchise or license, or because of the enforcement thereof by the city, or
from the use of the rights-of-way. Nothing herein shall preclude the person or
utility from seeking injunctive or declaratory judgment relief against the city
where such relief is otherwise available and the requirements therefor are
otherwise satisfied.
   (P)   Review required; use of existing facilities. The design, location and
nature of all facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the
City Engineer. Such review shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis in application
of city policy, and approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld. All new
facilities or structures shall collocate on existing poles or existing conduit,
trenches or other facilities to minimize unnecessary use of rights-of-way
space, to reduce potential existing or future interference and obstructions and
to reduce the cost to the public or others therefrom and to maximize the
public’s ability to use and license appropriate private or public uses of the
rights-of-way in the public interest (except where preempted by law or where
good cause is established as determined by the city applying these objectives).
Where existing poles or facilities are available, or exist at or near the
proposed use, unless otherwise approved, the applicant must either use such
facilities, or file a written request, verified by the applicant, for exception
specifying the specific reasons why such facilities are not available or
feasible to be used, and addressing the objectives hereof. City height
limitations, applicable zoning restrictions and general city policies with
regard to all users of the rights-of-way shall be applicable to all facilities.
The City Engineer may establish such regulations or policies as may be deemed
necessary or appropriate to effect this provision. For applications for
installation of any facility in the rights-of-way, the most restrictive
adjacent underlying zoning district classification shall apply unless otherwise
specifically zoned and designated on the official zoning map.
      (1)   (a)   No utility may erect, construct or install new utility poles
or other facilities above the surface of the rights-of-way without the written
permission of the city based on good cause established by the utility and found
by the city. Good cause may be shown by demonstrating the following:
            1.   There exist other utility poles or support structures,
proximate to the area, that are located above-ground. For purposes of showing
good cause under this factor, evidence of good cause for new utility poles
shall only be compared to existing utility poles, evidence of good cause for
new support structures shall only be compared to existing support structures;
            2.   The proposed underground installation is impossible,
impractical or not technically feasible; or
            3.   When, in the city’s judgment, the proposed utility pole
installation will be made at a location, and will employ suitable design and
materials, to provide the greatest protection of aesthetic qualities of the
proximate area without adversely affecting safety.
         (b)   Where reasonable and appropriate and where adequate rights-of-
way exist, the utility shall place above-ground facilities underground in
conjunction with city capital improvement projects and/or at specific locations
requested by the city; provided that such placement is practical, efficient and
economically feasible. The requirements herein shall not prohibit the
replacement of existing utility poles.
      (2)   (a)   All small wireless facilities, as defined in 50 ILCS 840/10,
in the rights-of-way shall comply with the following requirements, in addition
to any other design, safety, spacing or construction requirements as may be
outlined in a franchise agreement or the city’s code:
            1.   The maximum height of a small wireless facility that is
collocated on a utility pole or support structure shall be no more than ten
feet above the utility pole or support structure that such small wireless
facility is collocated;
            2.   All written design standards, currently in effect or as may
hereafter be adopted by the Director, applicable to the city’s utility poles or
support structures shall be followed, along with all stealth, concealment and
any other aesthetic requirements or written design plans applicable to such
utility poles or support structures on record, adopted or in effect within the
city, including such stealth, concealment or other aesthetic requirements for
historic landmarks or within a district currently, or hereafter, zoned
historic;
            3.   The small wireless facility and any associated equipment
permitted shall be painted the same or similar color as the utility pole or
support structure upon which the facility and/or equipment is collocated. If
good cause is shown for ground-mounted equipment, such ground-mounted equipment
associated with a collocated small wireless facility shall be of such design,
including color and size, such that it maximally blends in to the built
environment of the proximate area;
            4.   New or replacement utility poles or support structures may not
exceed the higher of:
               a.    Forty-five feet AGL; or
               b.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date that an applicant submits an application to the city, that is
located within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or support structure and
that is in the same ROW within the jurisdiction of the city; provided, however,
that the city may designate which intersecting ROW within 300 feet of the
proposed utility pole or support structure shall control the height limitation
for such facility; without a special use permit approved by City Council
pursuant to §§
157.095 through
157.102, as may be hereinafter amended.
            5.   A utility must comply with any requirements imposed by any
contract between the city and a private property owner that concerns, or
relates to, design or construction standards for utility poles located in the
rights-of-way;
            6.   No new utility poles or other support structures may be
installed within the city’s rights-of-way without the prior approval of the
city upon good cause shown for compliance with design and aesthetic
requirements. This requirement does not prohibit modification of existing
utility poles or support structures to allow for collocation of small wireless
facilities. Replacement utility poles shall be permitted as required by
applicable law. In such a circumstance requiring a replacement pole for a small
wireless facility, replacement utility poles shall be at the sole cost of the
utility proposing the replacement utility pole;
            7.   No ground-mounted equip-ment associated with the small
wireless facility will be permitted. Waiver to this requirement may be granted
by the City Administrator upon good cause shown that the utility requires
ground-mounted equipment to utilize the site for a small wireless facility. If
good cause is shown permitting such ground-mounted equipment for a small
wireless facility, no other ground-mounted equipment shall be allowed for the
utility, or for the particular utility if the person provides only
infrastructure-related services for the utility, within 250 feet of that
approved ground-mounted equipment;
            8.   The proposed collocation, modification or replacement of
utility poles or support structures where approved pursuant to this franchise
shall cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of the rights-
of-way and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference
with, the rights and reasonable convenience of the property owners who adjoin
said rights-of-way;
            9.   The height of all portions of the small wireless facility
shall be located at least eight feet above ground level so as not to interfere
with pedestrian or vehicle traffic;
            10.   No portions of the small wireless facility shall extend
horizontally from the surface of the utility pole or collocated support
structure more than 16 inches;
            11.   If the proposed utility pole or support structure the person
proposes to locate its small wireless facility on is not structurally sound,
but the Director finds such site to be a desired location, the Director can
require the person to install a substantially similar utility pole or support
structure, at the person’s cost; and
            12.    Notwithstanding the maximum size descriptions which define a
small wireless facility contained in 50 ILCS 840/10 or otherwise contained in
applicable law, the proposed installation or collocation shall endeavor to use
the smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals and/
or cabinets then in use by the person, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
         (b)   The City Administrator may further waive one or more of these
requirements upon good cause shown by the person, and provided a showing that
the waiver is the minimum necessary to accomplish the purposes of this division
(P), or as otherwise required by applicable law. The burden of proof for any
waiver shall be wholly on the person and must be shown by clear and convincing
evidence.
   (Q)   Utility responsible for costs. The utility shall be responsible for
all reasonable costs borne by the city that are directly associated with the
utility’s installation, maintenance, repair, operation, use and replacement of

Administrator shall have the authority pursuant to this division (G) to execute
on behalf of the city such franchise agreements as provided below that are
identical to, or substantially the same as, the city’s “form” franchises
currently on file with the City Clerk, and incorporated herein, where such
franchise terms fully comply with applicable law under the application and
applicant at issue. Such administrative City Administrator approval be
authorized only for the following circumstance which may require more expedited
approvals:
         (a)   A franchise authorizing use of the ROW for facilities authorized
solely to provide “telecommunications at retail” as are subject to specific
state law definitions and requirements, specifically being limited to such
services as “sale of telecommunications at retail”, as defined in 35 ILCS 635/
10 and “telecommunications” “sale at retail”, as defined in 35 ILCS 636/5-7, as
may be applicable; and
         (b)   A franchise authorizing use of the ROW for facilities authorized
to provide communications services that may include both such
“telecommunications at retail” (being limited to such services as “sale of
telecommunications at retail”, as defined in 35 ILCS 635/10, and
“telecommunications” “sale at retail”, as defined in 35 ILCS 636/5-7, as may be
applicable), and other services or facilities (including, but not limited to,
wholesale, dark fiber or other communications services that are not
“telecommunications at retail” and are subject to the city’s linear foot fee as
provided for in §
53.23, except where may be otherwise provided by applicable law).
      (2)   To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the City
Administrator may execute these form franchise agreements with applicants
without any additional approval by the City Council upon determination by the
City Administrator that the applicant satisfies the city’s requirements and
policies for issuance of a franchise pursuant to this code. Failure to include
a specific form franchise shall in no way preclude an applicant seeking to
utilize the city’s rights-of-way for any authorized service from applying for
such a franchise and receiving authorization as provided for by the City
Council in this division (G). The administrative approval process in this
division (G) shall not be available for any franchise or license not provided
for herein or any franchise or license for which the City Administrator
determines there are material changes to the form, or where full compliance
with the code has not been demonstrated. Upon determination by the City
Administrator that a form franchise agreement (or such form with any minor or
ministerial changes or clarifications from the application or review that are
consistent with the purposes of the policies and code of the city) may be
properly issued based on the application submitted, the City Administrator may
so indicate to the applicant and request an executed copy be returned to the
city for execution by the City Administrator within a reasonable time period
stated. If actual or potential regulatory or other deadlines warrant more
immediate action by the city, the City Administrator may alternatively send to
the applicant the completed franchise agreement already executed by the City
Administrator, which franchise agreement shall be valid only if thereafter
executed by applicant, dated and returned to the city all within seven calendar
days of the date of execution by the City Administrator. For purposes of this
division (G), RETURNED TO THE CITY shall mean a complying document delivered to
City Hall and date and time stamped by the counter clerk of such receipt. No
franchise or license shall be valid to authorize use of the ROW if not executed
by both parties in conformance with all applicable requirements of this code.
Such executed transmittal to the applicant shall be deemed completion of the
city’s obligation under any applicable time requirements for a final decision
(Prior Code, § 53.03) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010; Ord. 4016, passed 12-4-
2017; Ord. 4090, passed 4-1-2019) Penalty, see §

§ 53.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   City review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the City Engineer
within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to
the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
the City Engineer shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons
therefor. If the City Engineer is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to
the requirements of this chapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules
and regulations, the City Engineer shall issue a permit therefor as soon as
practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, that the construction
proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to § 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it intends to commence
work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications
and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the
facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the
city not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work requiring no
excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of work
requiring excavation. The City Engineer shall specify the portion of the right-
of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the City Engineer fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either:
         (a)   Ten days after service of notice to the city by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction; or
         (b)   Twenty-five days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
53.04, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city an application
for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of division (A) above.
   (C)   Additional city review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 (220 ILCS 5/21-100 et seq.) shall be deemed
granted 45 days after submission to the city, unless otherwise acted upon by
the city; provided the holder has complied with applicable city codes,
ordinances and regulations.

53.99
§ 53.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on city rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
(Prior Code, § 53.06) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010) Penalty, see §
53.99
§ 53.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
53.21. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall
either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that
it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

§ 53.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the city, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) below:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises
operations, explosion, collapse and underground hazard (commonly referred to as
“X”, “C” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each
person;
            2.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any
one accident; and
            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of liability.
         (b)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles
with a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property
damage for each accident;
         (c)   Workers’ compensation with statutory limits; and
         (d)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (2)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
   “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the city,
by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice addressed to the City Administrator of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the city of the notice, and in no
event later than ten days prior to the cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) above. A
utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds
under division (A) above, or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D)
above. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) above, such as
evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer” under the Workers’
Compensation Act (820 ILCS 305).
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state. (All insurance
carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-” or better and of a class
size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.)
(Prior Code, § 53.08) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010) Penalty, see §
53.99
§ 53.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Prior Code, § 53.09) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010)
§ 53.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter, including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
(B) shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
state at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the City Engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities
in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the City Engineer may, in the
exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the
permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal
to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of
this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The city, upon 14-days’ advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14-day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee
shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division (C) above.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for the withdrawal to the city; provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) above.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of the revocation; provided
that any amounts in excess of the costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to the security fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the city, the permittee shall have the following options:
      (1)   Immediately provide the city with evidence that no cause exists for
the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the city, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the city within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the city, providing written proof of such removal to the
city within ten days after receipt of the written notice of revocation. The
city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time periods
provided in this division (C).
   (D)   Stop-work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the city may issue a stop-work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) above.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply.
      (1)   If the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of division
(C) above, the city or its designee may, at the option of the city:
         (a)   Correct the deficiencies;
         (b)   Upon not less than 20- days’ notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or
         (c)   After not less than 30 days’ notice to the permittee of failure
to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the city.
      (2)   The permittee shall be liable in all events to the city for all
costs of removal.
(Prior Code, § 53.11) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010)
§ 53.12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER’S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the city no less than
30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-of-way
or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or the
facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former
owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and facilities in
the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the city’s right-of-
way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
(Prior Code, § 53.12) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010)

(Prior Code, § 53.14) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010)
§ 53.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division
(A).
      (1)   No interference with city facilities. No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the City Engineer determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the city’s
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the city’s utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with, the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin the right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound

without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-ground
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of city highways may
require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or
additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90-degree angle to the centerline as practicable.

and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their

         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by the “Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways”, 23 C.F.R. part 655, subpart
F. Where practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between the
roadway and the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be
allowed to remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width
does not allow for windrowing excavated material off the paved portion of the
roadway, excavated material shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the city to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction”. When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         (b)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Engineer (Director of Public Works), the utility, at its
expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the
installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and
restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs and driveways to the proper grades, as
determined by the Engineer.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division (A)(4)
is permitted under §
53.21, the following requirements shall apply.
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Engineer.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the city.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
city.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or city approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the city. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided
and maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for
minimum cover for the type of facility:
 
Type of Facility                        Minimum Cover

installation so guys and braces will not be needed. Variances may be allowed if
there is no feasible alternative and if guy wires are equipped with guy guards
for maximum visibility.
         (c)   Underground facilities.
            1.   Cable may be installed by trenching or plowing; provided that
special consideration is given to boring in order to minimize damage when
crossing improved entrances and side roads.
            2.   If a crossing is installed by boring or jacking, encasement
shall be provided between jacking or bore pits. Encasement may be eliminated
only if:
               a.   The crossing is installed by the use of “moles”, “whip
augers” or other approved method which compress the earth to make the opening
for cable installation; or
               b.   The installation is by the open trench method which is only
permitted prior to roadway construction.
            3.   Cable shall be grounded in accordance with the National
Electrical Safety Code.
         (d)   Burial of drops. All temporary service drops placed between
November 1 of the prior year and March 15 of the current year, also known as
snowdrops, shall be buried by May 31 of the current year, weather permitting,
unless otherwise permitted by the city. Weather permitting, utilities shall
bury all temporary drops, excluding snowdrops, within ten business days after
placement.
      (2)   Underground facilities other than electric power or communication
lines. Underground facilities, other than electric power or communication
lines, may be installed by:
         (a)   The use of “moles”, “whip augers” or other approved methods
which compress the earth to move the opening for the pipe;
         (b)   Jacking or boring with vented encasement provided between the
ditch lines or toes of slopes of the highway;
         (c)   Open trench with vented encasement between ultimate ditch lines
or toes of slopes, but only if prior to roadway construction; or
         (d)   Tunneling with vented encasement, but only if installation is
not possible by other means.

the current “Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in
Illinois”.
      (6)   Ground-mounted appurtenances. Ground-mounted appurtenances to
overhead or underground facilities, when permitted within a right-of-way, shall
be provided with a vegetation-free area extending one foot (305 mm) in width
beyond the appurtenance in all directions. The vegetation-free area may be
provided by an extension of the mounting pad, or by heavy duty plastic or
similar material approved by the City Engineer. With the approval of the City
Engineer, shrubbery surrounding the appurtenance may be used in place of
vegetation-free area. The housing for ground-mounted appurtenances shall be
painted a neutral color to blend with the surroundings.
   (C)   Materials.
      (1)   General standards. The materials used in constructing facilities
within rights-of-way shall be those meeting the accepted standards of the
appropriate industry, the applicable portions of IDOT’s “Standards
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction”, the requirements of the State
Commerce Commission or the standards established by other official regulatory
agencies for the appropriate industry.
      (2)   Material storage on right-of-way. No material shall be stored on
the right-of-way without the prior written approval of the City Engineer. When
such storage is permitted, all pipe, conduit, wire, poles, cross arms or other
materials shall be distributed along the right-of-way prior to and during
installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the public or an obstacle to
right-of-way maintenance or damage to the right-of-way and other property. If
material is to be stored on right-of-way, prior approval must be obtained from
the city.
      (3)   Hazardous materials. The plans submitted by the utility to the city
shall identify any hazardous materials that may be involved in the construction
of the new facilities or removal of any existing facilities.
   (D)   Operational restrictions.
      (1)   Construction operations on rights-of-way may, at the discretion of
the city, be required to be discontinued when such operations would create
hazards to traffic or the public health, safety and welfare. Such operations
may also be required to be discontinued or restricted when conditions are such
that construction would result in extensive damage to the right-of-way or other
property.
      (2)   These restrictions may be waived by the City Engineer when
emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.
      (3)   Unless otherwise permitted by the city, the hours of building and
construction are those set forth in §
94.01.
   (E)   Location of existing facilities. Any utility proposing to construct
facilities in the city shall contact J.U.L.I.E. and ascertain the presence and
location of existing above-ground and underground facilities within the rights-
of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities. The city will make its permit
records available to a utility for the purpose of identifying possible
facilities. When notified of an excavation or when requested by the city or by
J.U.L.I.E., a utility shall locate and physically mark its underground
facilities within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, in accordance with
the State Underground Facilities Damage Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.)
(Prior Code, § 53.16) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010)
§ 53.17 VEGETATION CONTROL.
   (A)   Electric utilities; compliance with state laws and regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable state laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the city as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities; tree-trimming permit required. Tree-trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable state laws and regulations specifically
governing the same shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree-trimming permit. Applications for tree-
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree-trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree-trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The city will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.
   (D)   Chemical use.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) below, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the city for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or

§ 53.18 REMOVAL, RELOCATION OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the city, a
utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any city
improvement in or upon, or the operations of the city in or upon, the rights-
of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the city, any utility that owns, controls or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The city retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the city, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or
useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior
to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the city, the utility shall notify the city within 90 days.
Following receipt of such notice, the city may direct the utility to remove all
or any portion of the facility if the City Engineer determines that such
removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare.
In the event that the city does not direct the utility that abandoned the
facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the city, the
abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of
all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.

§ 53.19 CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION.
   The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and
terrain and other property within ten days after any portion of the rights-of-
way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or maintenance by
the utility, all to the satisfaction of the city. This includes restoration of
entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using
materials and methods approved by the City Engineer. Such cleanup and repair
may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding or
any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The
time period provided in this section may be extended by the City Engineer for
good cause shown.

§ 53.20 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit.
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way,
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
City Engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
City Police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the city a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48 hours after
an emergency repair.
(Prior Code, § 53.20) (Ord. 3694, passed 10-18-2010)
§ 53.21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the City Engineer as
a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of
this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance
should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The City Engineer shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The City Engineer may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the City Engineer may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the City
Engineer under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to
the City Council, or such other committee, board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City
Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The City Council shall commence its consideration of the appeal
at the Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven days
after the filing of the appeal. The City Council shall timely decide the
appeal.

§ 53.23 COMPENSATION FOR USE OF THE RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   (A)   Use fees.
      (1)   Unless otherwise lawfully established by the City Council, or as
required by applicable law, utilities shall pay to the city as monthly
compensation for the use of the rights-of-way, other than for incidental uses,
a monthly use fee of:
         (a)   One thousand dollars per month for the first mile of linear
facilities, or part thereof, plus $0.16 per linear foot per month thereafter;
and
         (b)   Two hundred dollars per month for each antenna in the rights-of-
way, or such other amounts as established by the City Council.
      (2)   Linear foot fees shall be due and payable on a monthly basis within
30 calendar days of the close of each month for which the payment applies. If
any use fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or
before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until
received, at the rate of 1.5% per month, unless such other maximum rate is
established by law.
      (3)   The utility shall be entitled to a credit to the linear foot fee
owed pursuant to division (A)(1)(a) above in the final amount of any payments
owed under the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax (35 ILCS 636/5-1 et
seq., “SMTT”) and paid to the city for the same period; provided such amount is
specifically shown and documented in the applicable fee statement accompanying
the linear foot payment and such credit shall not exceed the amount of linear
foot fee owed for that period.
      (4)   The uses required in this section shall be paid by the utility as
required herein without offset, credit, refund or deduction except for such
credit as is expressly provided for above for SMTT paid.

federal or state law.
   (B)   Bundled services. The utility expressly acknowledges and agrees that,
to the extent it markets bundled services, including a combination of goods or
services that may be subject to this chapter, it will fairly reflect to the
city an appropriate and reasonable division of services among the various
services offered, based on the actual value of each separate service. Whether
or not the utility separates services on a subscriber’s bill, it will provide
to the city notice of any such allocation sufficient for city verification.
Should the utility engage in billing or payment practices that, in the
reasonable determination of the city, do not fairly reflect a fair and
appropriate allocation, the city may nullify such allocation and require
payment applicable to the full receipts.
   (C)   Fee statement. Each use fee payment shall be accompanied by a
statement showing the manner in which the use fee was calculated, and in such

corrected statement, including interest on the amount as provided herein.
Within 90 calendar days following the end of the calendar year, each licensee
shall submit a statement, certified as true, setting forth its gross revenues,
the amount of linear foot and antennae within the facilities, and describing
what revenues or receipts (including each type of services were included and
excluded in the fee calculations for the calendar year, and describing any
adjustments, additional payments or credits) arising from information not known
and reflected as of the payment date. Any required additional payment shall be
included with the report, any credit shall be deducted from the following
annual payment.
   (D)   No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the city of any use fee
shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct
amount, nor shall acceptance of any use fee payment be construed as a release
of any claim of the city.
   (E)   Maintain records. Utilities shall, at all times, maintain complete and
accurate books of account, and records of the business, ownership and
operations of the utility with respect to the facilities, in a manner that
allows the city to determine whether the utility has properly calculated its
use fee in compliance with this chapter. Should the city reasonably determine
that the records are not being maintained in such manner, the utility shall
correct the manner in which the books and/or records are maintained so that the
utility comes into compliance with this section. All financial books and
records maintained in accordance with FCC regulations and the regulations of
any governmental entity regulating utilities in the state, and generally
accepted accounting principles, shall be deemed to be acceptable under this
section. Such books and records shall be maintained for a period of at least
five years, but nothing herein shall limit the years or scope of audit if
reasonably related to determining or enforcing compliance.
   (F)   Right of inspection. The city or its designated representatives shall
have the right to inspect, examine or audit, during normal business hours and
upon seven calendar day notice, all documents, records or other information
that pertains to the facilities within the ROW and/or the utility’s user fee
obligations. In addition to access to the records of utility for audits, upon
request, the utility shall provide reasonable access to records necessary to
verify compliance with the terms of this chapter.

§ 53.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the city will
incur delay or other costs, including third-party claims, because the utility
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless
the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city’s costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street

After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the
intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an
immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the

of a motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal which fails to change to
a green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120 seconds
because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the
arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle’s size or weight, shall
have the right to proceed, after yielding the right-of-way to oncoming traffic
facing a green signal, subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign as required by §
70.041.

§ 70.082 SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT.
   (A)   Whenever a police officer has reason to believe that a motor vehicle
is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this subchapter, the police
officer shall provide for the towing of the motor vehicle to a facility
approved by the city. This subchapter shall not apply if the motor vehicle used
in the violation was stolen at the time and the theft was reported to the
appropriate police authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered
or reasonably should have been discovered.
   (B)   The police officer shall notify any person identifying himself or
herself as the owner of the motor vehicle or any person who is found to be in
control of the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, if there is
such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of the motor vehicle owner’s
right to an administrative hearing to be conducted under this section.
(Prior Code, § 70.082) (Ord. 3653, passed 1-4-2010; Ord. 3743, passed 2-6-2012)
§ 70.083 ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING.
   (A)   Within ten days after a motor vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant
to this subchapter, the city shall notify by personal service or by first class
mail to the owner of record of the owner’s right to a hearing, along with the
date, time and location of the hearing, to challenge whether a violation of
this subchapter has occurred. The hearing date must be scheduled and convened
no later than 45 days after the mailing of the notice, or issuance of the
notice of hearing. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not
apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible.
   (B)   If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the motor vehicle was used in violation of
this subchapter, then the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the
owner of record of the motor vehicle liable to the city for the applicable
administrative fee.
   (C)   If, after the hearing, the hearing officer does not determine by a
preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle was used in such a
violation, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding for the owner and
for the return of the motor vehicle, or the administrative fees if already
paid.
   (D)   (1)   If owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the owner of
record shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing.
      (2)   If the owner of record pays such administrative fee and the motor
vehicle is returned to the owner, no default order need be entered if the owner
was informed of his or her right to a hearing, in which case an order of
liability shall be deemed to have been made when the city receives the written
waiver.
   (E)   (1)   If a bond in the amount equal to the applicable administrative
fee is posted with the Police Department, the impounded motor vehicle shall be
released to the owner of record.
      (2)   The owner of the motor vehicle shall still be liable to the towing
agent for any applicable towing fees.
   (F)   (1)   If an administrative fee is imposed for a violation of this
subchapter, the bond will be forfeited to the city; however, if a violation of
this subchapter is not proven by preponderance of the evidence, the bond will
be returned to the person posting the bond.
      (2)   All bond money posted pursuant to this subchapter shall be held by
the city until the hearing officer issues a decision or, if there is a judicial
review, until the court of jurisdiction issues its orders.
   (G)   All decisions of the administrative hearing officer shall be subject
to review under the provisions of the State Administrative Review Law, being
735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.

towing fees are paid to the towing agent, in which case the owner of record
shall be given possession of the motor vehicle;
      (2)   A bond in an amount equal to the applicable administrative fee is
posted with the Police Department and all applicable towing fees are paid to
the towing agent, at which time the motor vehicle will be released to the owner
of record; or
      (3)   The motor vehicle is deemed abandoned in which case the motor
vehicle shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition
of abandoned motor vehicles.
(Prior Code, § 70.084) (Ord. 3653, passed 1-4-2010; Ord. 3743, passed 2-6-2012)
§ 70.085 MOTOR VEHICLE POSSESSION.
   (A)   Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 35 days after:
      (1)   The expiration of the time during which the owner of record may

record who is in default may be disposed of as an unclaimed motor vehicle as
provided by law.

state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the subject motor vehicle may not
be disposed of by the city, except as consistent with those proceedings.

the motor vehicle to obtain documentation issued by the Police Department
confirming compliance with foregoing requirements, and retain photocopies of
that documentation in their files for a period of not less than six months
following release of the motor vehicle. The foregoing information shall be made
available to the authorities of the city for inspection and copying, upon their
request, by the towing or storage company. The towing or storage company is
prohibited from releasing any motor vehicle they may tow within the city until
and unless they obtain documentation as aforesaid.
   (B)   The towing or storage company shall be entitled to receive a
reasonable fee from the owner or person entitled to possession of any such
motor vehicle prior to the release of the motor vehicle. The fee shall be to
cover the cost of removing said motor vehicle and, in addition thereto, the
cost of storage of said motor vehicle for each day or fraction thereof that
said motor vehicle shall have remained stored.
   (C)   The fees in this section shall be in addition to any fee levied or
assessed against the owner or operator of said motor vehicle by reason of
violation of any ordinance or statute and any arrest which may have resulted
from such violation.

certified copy of said judgment to the Police Department, any administrative
fees or posted bonds obtained by the city shall be refunded to the paying
party.
(Prior Code, § 70.087) (Ord. 3653, passed 1-4-2010; Ord. 3743, passed 2-6-2012)

vehicle so as to obstruct the entrance or exit of any place where Police or
Fire Department apparatus or other emergency equipment is kept or housed, or so
as to block an emergency entrance to a hospital. Nor shall this section apply
to any person charged with parking a vehicle so as to entirely obstruct traffic

which no penalty is provided shall be subject to the terms of §
10.99.

the police station, a receipt shall be issued for all money so received and the
money shall be promptly turned over to the City Treasurer to be credited to the
General Fund. The members of the Police Department are hereby authorized to
refrain from instituting a prosecution for the alleged offense involved. This

SPEED RESTRICTIONS
§ 71.001 SPEED LIMITS.
   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this state at a speed
which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or endangers the safety of any person or
property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable
maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed
when approaching and crossing an intersection, approaching and going around a
curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding
roadway or when special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other
traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be decreased
as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or
entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all
persons to use due care.
   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any highway of this state at a
speed which is greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit
established by divisions (C) through (G) below, by 625 ILCS 5/11-605 or by a
regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.
   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in an urban district and residential district within
the city for all vehicles is:
      (1)   Twenty-five mph, unless otherwise posted; and
      (2)   Fifteen mph in an alley.
   (D)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for any vehicle is 65 mph for
all highways under the jurisdiction of the State Toll Highway Authority and for
all or part of highways that are designated by the Department, have at least
four lanes of traffic and have a separation between the roadways moving in
opposite directions and 55 mph for all other highways, roads and streets.
   (E)   Unless some lesser speed restriction is established under this
chapter, the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for a second
division vehicle designed or used for the carrying of a gross weight of 8,001
pounds or more (including the weight of the vehicle and maximum load) is 55
mph.
   (F)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for a bus is:
      (1)   Sixty-five mph upon any highway which has at least four lanes of
traffic and of which the roadways for traffic moving in opposite directions are
separated by a strip of ground which is not surfaced or suitable for vehicular
traffic, except that the maximum speed limit for a bus on all highways, roads
or streets not under the jurisdiction of the Department or the State Toll
Highway Authority is 55 mph; and
      (2)   Fifty-five mph on any other highway.

         (b)   A primary or secondary school operated by a religious
institution; and
         (c)   A public, private or religious nursery school.
      (2)   On a school day when school children are present and so close
thereto that a potential hazard exists because of the close proximity of the
motorized traffic, no person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in excess
of 20 mph while passing a school zone or while traveling on a local, county or
state roadway on public school property or upon any public thoroughfare where
children pass going to and from school.
      (3)   For the purpose of this section, a SCHOOL DAY begins at 6:30 a.m.
and concludes at 4:00 p.m.
      (4)   This section shall not be applicable unless appropriate signs are
posted upon streets and highways under their respective jurisdiction and
maintained by the city wherein the school zone is located. With regard to the
special speed limit while passing schools, such signs shall give proper due
warning that a school zone is being approached, and shall indicate the school
zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when school
children are present.
(625 ILCS 5/11-605(a))
      (5)   Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit the use of electronic speed-
detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a special school speed zone
indicating such zone, as defined in this section, nor shall evidence obtained
thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding provided the use of
such device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in such
special school speed zone.
(625 ILCS 5/11-605(c))
   (B)   Highway construction or maintenance speed zones.
      (1)   (a)   A person may not operate a motor vehicle in a construction or

workers are not present.
      (2)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the use of electronic speed-
detecting devices within 500 feet of signs within a construction or maintenance
speed zone indicating the zone, as defined in this section, nor shall evidence
obtained by use of those devices be inadmissible in any prosecution for
speeding; provided the use of the device shall apply only to the enforcement of
the speed limit in the construction or maintenance speed zone.
      (3)   (a)   As used in this section, a CONSTRUCTION OR MAINTENANCE SPEED
ZONE is an area in which the Department, Toll Highway Authority or local agency
has posted signage advising drivers that a construction or maintenance speed
zone is being approached, or in which the Department, Authority or local agency
has posted a lower speed limit with a highway construction or maintenance speed
zone special speed limit sign after determining that the preexisting
established speed limit through a highway construction or maintenance project
is greater than is reasonable or safe with respect to the conditions expected

SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED
§ 71.075 OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN OR RAILROAD TRACK
EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   (1)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad
grade crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet,
from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall not proceed until the tracks
are clear and he or she can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall
apply when:
         (a)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
         (b)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagger gives or continues
to give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad
track equipment;
         (c)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a
highway crossing emits a warning signal and the train or railroad track
equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an immediate
hazard;
         (d)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing; or
         (e)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
      (2)   Whenever any person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined
in 625 ILCS 5/6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is
not always required to stop, the person must exercise due care and caution as
the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and
under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall stop
within 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet, from the nearest rail of the
railroad and shall not proceed until the tracks are clear and he or she can do
so safely. The foregoing requirements shall apply when:
         (a)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
         (b)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagger gives or continues
to give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad
track equipment;
         (c)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a
highway crossing emits a warning signal, and such railroad train or railroad
track equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an
immediate hazard;
         (d)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing; and
         (e)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.
      (3)   Whenever a person driving a commercial motor vehicle, as defined in
625 ILCS 5/6-500, approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not
always required to stop but must slow down, the person must exercise due care
and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning
of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the
driver shall slow down within 50 feet, but not less that 15 feet, from the
nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or she checks that
the tracks are clear of an approaching train or railroad track equipment.
   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (C)   The Department, and city authorities with the approval of the
Department, are hereby authorized to designate particularly dangerous highway
grade crossings of railroads and to erect stop signs thereat. When such stop
signs are erected, the driver of any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet, but not
less than 15 feet, from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall proceed
only upon exercising due care.
   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs,
without automatic, electric or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates or a
human flagger giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad
track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall, in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly
marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet, but not less than 15
feet, from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment
after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference
is prima facie evidence of the driver’s failure to yield right-of-way.
   (E)   No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to
negotiate a railroad- highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient
undercarriage clearance.

parking decal or device or is not transporting the authorized holder of the
disability license plate or parking decal or device to or from the parking

OVERWEIGHT AND OVERSIZED VEHICLE PERMITS
§ 75.40 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ANNUAL PERMIT. A permit issued to a single truck, truck-tractor power unit
or piece of special mobile equipment which is valid for unlimited moves for a
period not to exceed one-year from the date of issuance.
   NON-DIVISIBLE. A vehicle and load will be considered non-divisible when
further separating or dismantling the vehicle or load:
      (1)   Would require more than eight work hours to dismantle using
appropriate equipment. The applicant has the burden of proof as to the number
of work hours required to dismantle the load;
      (2)   Will compromise or destroy the intended use of the load only. A
load can be either permanently mounted or temporarily secured equipment. Any
parts, fluids or material necessary to the operation of only the power unit
portion of the vehicle shall be deemed non-divisible; and
      (3)   Would prohibit the vehicle from hauling one attachment that is
necessary to the operation of the load. To be considered NON-DIVISIBLE, the
attachment must be securely mounted to the load in the manner it is to be used
and not carried as a separate object on the hauling vehicle. It is the duty of
the applicant to declare such an attachment in the permit application.
   ONE-WAY or SINGLE TRIP PERMIT. One move from the point of origin to the
point of destination. Any additional stops between the point of origin and the
point of destination are expressly prohibited. SINGLE TRIP PERMITS are valid
for five consecutive days from the date of issuance unless otherwise directed
by the Police Department.
   QUARTERLY PERMIT. A permit issued to a single truck, truck-tractor power
unit or piece of special mobile equipment which is valid for unlimited moves
for a period not to exceed three months from the date of issuance.
   ROUND-TRIP MOVEMENT. Two trips over the same route in opposite directions.
Round-trip permits are valid for ten consecutive days from the date of
issuance.
(Prior Code, § 75.30) (Ord. 3848, passed 11-3-2014)
§ 75.41 PERMITS.
   (A)   (1)   A permit shall be required for the movement of any vehicle or
combinations of vehicles that is non-divisible or is carrying a load that is
non-divisible, while operating on roadways and bridges within the jurisdiction
of the city which exceeds the following limits:
         (a)   Maximum weight specified in 625 ILCS 5/15-111;
         (b)   Maximum overall length specified in 625 ILCS 5/15-107;
         (c)   Maximum overall width specified in 625 ILCS 5/15-102; and
         (d)   Maximum overall height specified in 625 ILCS 5/15-103.
      (2)   Exempt from permits are the following:
         (a)   Fire Departments vehicles;
         (b)   Those vehicles operating under an emergency declaration;
         (c)   City-owned vehicles engaged in emergency utility repair; and
         (d)   Equipment used for snow and ice removal, owned by any

   (B)   Permits shall be issued only in the name of a person, firm, business
or corporation that owns and operates the transporting vehicle or that operates
the vehicle under a bona fide lease agreement.
   (C)   Permits for vehicles that are both overweight and/or oversized are
valid only a half hour before sunrise until a half hour after sunset, on any
day which a permit issued by the State Department of Transportation is valid.
   (D)   Permits are non-transferable and apply only to the permittee.
   (E)   The city may issue revisions to permits:
      (1)   To correct an error attributed to the city;

the move; and
      (3)   To adjust weights, dimension or routes as issued on the permit,
before the move is made.
   (F)   The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between the
permittee and the city that the move described in the application will take
place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the
Police Department any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either the city or
the permittee before starting any move. Undertaking the move is prima facie
evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and its terms.
   (G)   The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of
the authority granted by the permit for the use of roads under the jurisdiction
of the city, and any vehicle and/or load found to be off route will be
considered off route and without a permit. Permits shall be in the drivers
possession, at all times, unless otherwise directed by the Police Department
and presented upon demand to any and all police officers for the purpose of
inspection.
   (H)   Any vehicle(s) and/or load found to be divisible will render the
permit null and void. The entire gross weight and axles weights of the vehicles
(s) with the load are subject to legal weights. It is the duty of the applicant
to verify the non-divisibility of the vehicle(s) before making application for
the permit. The permit application itself is prima facie evidence that that
applicant confirmed the vehicle(s) and/or load were non-divisible.
   (I)   If required, arrangement shall be made by the permittee to have the
proper utilities notified, property moved, bridge or highway analysis performed
and completed in advance of any permit movement.

applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
   (K)   Permits are null and void if altered for the purpose of deception. The
permits issued under this section constitute the grant of privilege by the city
and may be denied or suspended for such reasons as the city may deem rationally
related to its governmental interests, including, but not limited to:
      (1)   A permittee knowingly provided incorrect information in an
application for a permit;
      (2)   A permittee, its agents or employees operating on a permit which
has been altered for purposes of deception;
      (3)   Non-compliance by permittee, its agents or employees with federal,
state or local ordinances pertaining to the transport of goods or operation of
a vehicle engaged in the transport of goods; and
      (4)   Moving on city streets without a valid permit as required under
this section.
   (L)   All single-trip or round-trip permits are limited to movements on
assigned routes only.
   (M)   (1)   All quarterly or annual overweight permits are restricted to the
following maximum limitations and routing:

the Police Department; and
         (f)   May not use any city street as a cut-thru to avoid using a
state, country or township highway.
      (2)   These permits are subject to all standards of application set forth
in §
75.42, except that the load may be interchanged provided none of the above
listed maximum weight and size dimensions are exceeded. Quarterly and annual
permits shall list the registration number and state for the power unit, and
vehicle identification number (VIN). The serial number of the power unit, and/
or owner applied number shall also be listed, if applicable. Any violation of
these terms will render the permit null and void, and subject the driver, firm,
business or corporation that owns the vehicle to legal weight and dimension
laws. The arresting police officer will immediately confiscate the permit.

hearing with the officer ordering the abatement as to whether a nuisance or

   (B)   Obstruction of view; eyesores. No owner or tenant of any property

weeds, grass or shrubbery tends to detract from the beauty or esthetics of the
surrounding properties.
   (C)   Maintenance of the public right-of-way. The owner or tenant of any
property within the city abutting a public street or alley shall maintain the
vegetation in the abutting public right-of-way or parkway in the same manner as

The appeal must be reviewed and approved by the Director of Community
Development or his or her designee. Affected property owners may seek
clarification for specific properties through the Community Development
Department.
   (D)   Notice to abate. In the event weeds, grass or shrubbery is permitted
to grow and to obstruct the vision of users of any street, road, highway,
driveway or alley within the city or to detract from the beauty or aesthetics
of the surrounding properties, it shall be the duty of the code enforcement
officer to give the owner and/or tenant of such property a written notice to
abate the nuisance. The notice shall designate the property and describe the
nuisance and shall direct the owner and/or tenant to abate the nuisance within
ten days from the date of delivery of the notice. The notice shall be delivered
to the owner of the property by certified mail at the address of the property
if the owner occupies the property or, if it is determined the owner does not
occupy the property, notice shall be sent by certified mail to the owner’s
reasonably ascertainable address, or if none, to the person to whom was sent
the tax bill for the general taxes on the property as then shown on the records
of the County Treasurer. Notice shall be sent to the tenant by certified mail
at the address of the property if occupied by the tenant, otherwise, to the
reasonably ascertainable address of the tenant. If the address of the owner or
tenant cannot be reasonably ascertained, notice may be posted upon the
property.
   (E)   Abatement by city. In the event the owner and/or tenant fails to abate
the nuisance within ten days from the date of service of the notice to abate,
the code enforcement officer or other person acting under his or her direction
may enter upon the property to abate the nuisance by causing all weeds, grass
or uncontrolled shrubbery to be cut, sprayed or otherwise removed or abated.
   (F)   Lien for costs.
      (1)   The reasonable cost of cutting or spraying of the weeds, grass or
uncontrolled shrubbery or otherwise abating the nuisance shall be a lien upon
the owner’s premises superior to all other liens and encumbrances except tax
liens; provided within 60 days after such cost and expenses are incurred by the
city or the person or entity performing the service by authority of the city,
the city files a notice of lien in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds,
with said notice to consist of a sworn statement setting out:
         (a)   A description of the real estate sufficient for identification
thereof;
         (b)   The amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred
or payable by the city; and
         (c)   The date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by the
city.
      (2)   The cost of abating the nuisance shall, however, not be a lien on
the property unless a written notice is personally served on, or sent by
certified mail to, the person to whom was sent the tax bill for the general
taxes on the property for the last preceding year. The notice shall state the
substance of 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7, and of this section, and further shall identify
the property by common description and the location of the nuisance abated.
      (3)    Further, the lien of the city shall not be valid as to any
purchaser whose rights in and to such real estate have arisen subsequent to the
nuisance abatement and prior to the filing of such notice, and the lien of the
city shall not be valid as to any mortgagee, judgment creditor or other lienor
whose rights in and to such real estate arise prior to the filing of such
notice. Upon payment of the cost and expense by the owner of or persons
interested in such property after notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall
be released by the city and the release may be filed of record as in the case
of the filing of the notice of lien.
   (G)   Violations. In addition to the enforcement provisions of division (F)
above, any owner or tenant of the premises who fails to abate any nuisance in
the notice to abate within the time prescribed in the second notice shall be
subject to a fine, upon conviction of violating this section, as provided in §
94.99.

or continued by virtue or permission of any law of the state.

the notice to abate as described in §
94.03 within the time prescribed in the second notice shall be subject to a

assessed to any person found in violation of this chapter may be that said
person must engage in public service by cleaning the rights-of-way and other
public facilities of the city for an amount of time that, if the person found
to have violated this chapter was being paid the minimum wage under state law,
the amount paid for that person’s labors would have been equal to the monetary
penalty assessed under this chapter.

§ 111.01 PURPOSE; POLICY.

inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being and privacy in their
residences, as well as their ability to provide or receive information
regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities and
goods and services lawfully in commerce. The city has a substantial interest in
protecting the well-being, tranquility, personal safety and privacy of its
citizens, which includes the ability to protect citizens from unwanted
intrusions upon residential or commercial property. The city also has a
substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair
consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.
   (B)   General statement of policy. There must be a balance between these
substantial interests of the city and its citizens, and the effect of the
regulations in this chapter on the rights of those who are regulated. Based on
the collective experiences of city officials derived from regulating business
activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to
the inquiries of citizens regarding door-to-door and on street solicitation and
canvassing, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected
by door-to-door and on street solicitation and canvassing, as well as judicial
decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and
denied persons seeking to engage in door-to-door and on street solicitation and
canvassing, the city adopts this chapter to promote the city’s substantial
interests in:
      (1)   Respecting citizens’ decisions regarding privacy in their
residences and businesses;
      (2)   Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
      (3)   Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious
belief, political position or charitable activities; and
      (4)   Permitting truthful and non-misleading door-to-door and on street
solicitation regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate
commerce.

and regulations set forth in this chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and
protect the city interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing
the rights of those regulated.

INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE FEES.

maintenance fee attributable to that customer’s service address.
   (B)   Unless otherwise approved by the city, the infrastructure maintenance
fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications retailer to the city not later
than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in which a bill is
issued to the customer; provided, however, that the telecommunications retailer
may retain an amount not to exceed 2% of the city infrastructure maintenance

constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who
provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the
same manner as the original charge for such services.
   (E)   If it shall appear that an amount of infra-structure maintenance fee

credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due or to become due under
this subchapter from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the city may request, and the telecommunications
retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such credit. However, no
claim for such credit may be made more than three years after the date of the
erroneous payment unless:
      (1)   The credit is used only to offset a claim of underpayment made by
the city within the applicable statutory period of limitations; and
      (2)   The credit derives from an overpayment made by the same
telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.
   (F)   Amounts paid under this subchapter by telecommunications retailers
shall not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts:
      (1)   “Gross charges” for purposes of the Telecommunications Excise Tax
Act (35 ILCS 630/1 et seq.);

   (G)   The city shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the books
and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this subchapter to
determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the
city for the city infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of the
amount of the city infrastructure maintenance fee due to the city by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the city, plus 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by
the city in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit. Said sum shall be paid to
the city within 21 days after the date of issuance of any invoice for same.
   (H)   The city, or its designee, may promulgate such further or additional
regulations concerning the administration and enforcement of this subchapter,
consistent with its provisions, as may be required, from time to time, and
shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered pursuant to §
115.02.

time, if the Mayor, as Liquor Commissioner, determines the licensee has
violated the provisions of this chapter or of the Illinois Liquor Control Act
(235 ILCS 5/1-3 et seq.) or any valid code of the city, or any applicable rule
or regulation established by the Liquor Control Commission of the State
Commission which is not inconsistent with law. In addition to the suspension,
the Local Liquor Control Commissioner may levy a fine on the licensee for such

day on which a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. Not
more than $10,000 in fines under this section may be imposed against any

paid into the General Corporate Fund of the City Treasury.
      (2)   No such suspension, revocation or fine shall be effective until a
public hearing has been conducted by the Local Liquor Control Commission for
which hearing the licensee has been given three days’ prior notice which
affords the licensee an opportunity to appear and defend; provided, however,
that, if the Local Liquor Control Commissioner has reason to believe that the
continued operation by the licensee under his or her license will immediately
threaten the welfare of the community, the Local Liquor Control Commissioner
may, upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for such
conclusion and without notice or hearing, suspend such license and order the
licensee to cease the retail sale of alcoholic liquor for a period of not more
than seven days; provided the licensee is afforded an opportunity to be heard
during that period at a hearing conducted by the Local Liquor Control
Commission. If a person whose license is suspended or revoked pursuant to this
division (A)(2) is also engaged in the operation of another business or
businesses on the premises for which such license had been issued, such
revocation or suspension shall not be applicable to such other business or
businesses.

following any hearing conducted pursuant to division (A) above, make a written
determination that the license should be revoked or suspended or a fine
imposed, or that such revocation, suspension or fine should be denied; and if
the Local Liquor Control Commissioner determines, after such hearing, that the
license should be revoked or suspended or a fine should be imposed, such
written determination shall also state the reason or reasons for such
determination. A copy of such written determination shall be served upon the
licensee within five days of the date of which such written determination is
made by delivering such copy to or posting such copy at the premises described
in the license.
   (C)   Upon the entry of an order suspending or revoking a license or
imposing a fine pursuant to division (B) above, the licensee shall have all
rights to appeal such order as are allowed by state law.

complaint with the Mayor, stating that any licensee under this chapter has been
or is violating the provisions of this chapter, or any amendments hereto, or
any of the statutes of the state enacted with reference to the control of
liquor. Such complaint shall be in writing and shall be signed and sworn by the
parties complaining. The complaint shall state the particular provisions, rule
or regulation believed to have been violated and the facts in detail upon which
such belief is based. If the Mayor is satisfied that the complaint
substantially charges a violation and that from the facts alleged there is
reasonable cause for such belief, he or she shall set the matter for hearing to
suspend or revoke such license, as the Mayor determines appropriate, in
accordance with divisions (A) through (C) above, and shall serve notice upon
the licensee of the time and place of such hearing and of the particular
charges in the complaint.

§ 119.02 REGISTRATION FOR ALL HOTELS.
   (A)   Every operator of a hotel shall, at all times, keep a register in
which shall be ascribed, either in electronic, ink or typewritten form, prior
to the room being furnished or rented to a guest, the following information:
      (1)   The full name of the guest paying for the room and the full name of
each guest occupying the room;
      (2)   The home or business telephone number of the guest paying for the
room;
      (3)   The make, type and license number of each vehicle belonging to each

guests occupying the room) for each room; and
      (5)   The number of the room rented and the day, month, year and time
such room is rented.
   (B)   Every operator shall require each guest paying for the room to provide
a proper identification document prior to renting a room. The operator of a
hotel shall not rent a room without verifying the identification of the guest
paying for the room. The register shall be signed by the guest paying for the
room. All of the foregoing listed in this division (B) and division (A) above
shall be done before any guest is permitted to occupy a room.
   (C)   Operators shall keep registers on the hotel premises in the guest
reception or guest check-in area or in an office adjacent to or nearby that

for a period of not less than 90 days from and after the date of the last entry
in the register.
   (D)   Operators shall retain registers for a period of not less than two
years from the date of the last entry in the register or record. Except as
otherwise provided in division (C) above, such records may be retained on- or
off-site the hotel premises, but if maintained off-site, the records must be
readily accessible to permit inspection, review and audit by officials in
accordance with this chapter.
   (E)   Any police officer of the city or, at his or her direction, any
county, state or federal law enforcement official may request an operator to
consent to an inspection of the records in the register in order to determine
compliance with this chapter.
   (F)   If the operator objects to such an inspection, the operator shall then
be required to secure the records in the register in the presence of the
officer and in a manner directed by the officer so that no one tampers with the
records until such time as a warrant or court order has been issued or denied.
Upon the operator’s refusal, the officer must then make the demand of
inspection in writing and personally serve it on the operator. The demand must
be signed by the officer making the demand. No particular form of the demand is
required, but the demand must set forth the name of the hotel, the date and
time the demand is served on the hotel and the name of person served.
   (G)   If the operator receives a written demand pursuant to this section and
the operator desires to object to the demand, the operator must make a written
objection to the demand, with a copy of the demand attached, and personally
serve it within 48 hours after receiving the demand. Service of the objection
must be made on the officer making the demand or another officer of the same
law enforcement agency as the officer who made the demand. No particular form
of an objection is required, but the objection must be signed by the operator,
and set forth the date and time it is served on the officer or the agency.
Failure to timely make and serve a written objection to a demand is a waiver of
the operator’s right to seek pre-compliance judicial review of that demand.
   (H)   An operator that makes and serves an objection pursuant to division
(G) above may challenge the demand for inspection by filing an action for pre-
compliance judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction within ten
calendar days after the date the objection is served. Failure to timely file
such an action is a waiver of the operator’s right to seek pre-compliance
judicial review of that demand.
   (I)   An operator that fails to timely make and serve a written objection,
or that makes and serves a timely objection and then fails to timely file an
action for pre-compliance judicial review, must open the register for
inspection pursuant to division (E) above immediately after the lapse of the
period of time to make and serve a written objection or to file an action for
pre-compliance judicial review, whichever is applicable.
   (J)   Nothing in this section prohibits an officer from inspecting any
register pursuant to a warrant, an ex parte warrant or an exception to the
warrant requirement (e.g., consent or exigent circumstances).
   (K)   It shall be unlawful for any person to alter, deface or erase any
record in the register so as to make the information recorded in it illegible
or unintelligible, or hinder, obstruct or interfere with any inspection of the
register in accordance with this chapter.
   (L)   An employee of the owner, proprietor, manager or other person in
charge of any hotel, motel, lodging house, rooming house or other place
offering lodging accommodations to the general public for compensation must be
vigilant and on duty 24 hours each day, seven days a week, for the purpose of
attending, at all times, the facility’s registration desk or room. An attendant
need not be physically present at the point of registration at all times as
long as he or she is attending to other required duties. However, the attendant
must be immediately available to register a person(s) wishing to rent a room at
the facility.

Ord. 4037, passed 5-7-2018) Penalty, see §

§ 120.02 RESIDENTIAL RENTAL LICENSE FEE SCHEDULE.

   (B)   Multiple-dwelling rental complexes and hotels/motels will be issued
one license for each location authorizing a specific number of identified

schedule defined herein.
   (C)   A group of more than one lot or pad made available for placement of
mobile homes thereon under a common ownership or operation, commonly known as a
mobile home park, shall be deemed to be a multiple-dwelling rental complex for
the purposes of this chapter. Otherwise, a single lot or pad made available for
placement of a mobile home that is not within a mobile home park shall be
deemed to be single-family rental dwelling unit. Fees will not be assessed for
vacant lots or pads that are not available for rent.
   (D)   The full license fee shall be paid at the time of original
application. If renewal fees are not paid within 30 days after the date of
origination, late fees may apply based on the current residential rental
license fee schedule.
   (E)   Failure to pay any renewal fee and/or subsequent late fee may result
in suspension or revocation of the residential rental license and licensee may
be subject to the penalty provisions of §
120.99.
(Prior Code, § 120.02) (Ord. 3657, passed 3-1-2010; Ord. 3797, passed 5-6-2013;
Ord. 4037, passed 5-7-2018) Penalty, see §
120.99
§ 120.03 LICENSING PROCEDURES; STANDARDS; INSPECTION.
   (A)   Residential rental licenses shall be applied for within 30 days of a
property becoming rental property. If a residential rental license is applied
for after 30 days of a property becoming rental property, the license
origination date will be retroactive to the date the property became rental and
residential rental license fees will be calculated from this date and subject
to all applicable penalties as outlined in the current residential rental
license fee schedule.
   (B)   Residential rental licenses shall be issued for a period comprising
one year from the date of license approval. The license shall not be
transferable. A new residential rental license must be obtained by a new owner
in the event of a change in ownership of the rental housing.
   (C)   (1)   The city is hereby authorized, upon application, to issue new
residential rental licenses and renewals thereof in the names of owners, or if
operated by a separate person or entity, jointly in the name of both the
operator and owner of the rental housing. No such license shall be issued
unless the rental housing, including common areas, for which the license is
sought is found after inspection to meet all mandatory applicable City Crime
Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) inspection criteria as
established by a written order or resolution of the City Council. The Director
of Public Safety will establish rules and adopt policies and procedures in
order to clarify the application of its provisions and to obtain the intent and
purpose of this chapter.
      (2)   All rental properties shall comply with the following:
         (a)   All entry doors secured to guard against unlawful entry and
provide ability for renter to identify visitors;
         (b)   All windows secured to guard against unlawful entry;
         (c)   All rental units clearly identified for emergency personnel;
         (d)   All properties sufficiently lit and provide for safe pathways
for residents;
         (e)   All areas around rental property where crime activities may
occur identified and risks minimized;
         (f)   All common areas maintained in a manner as to not attract
criminal element; and
         (g)   All life safety issues observed during an inspection must be
addressed and rectified.
   (D)   On any residential rental license with four units or more, an annual
inspection will be performed on the exterior, including all common areas.
During any property maintenance inspection of the property, city inspectors are
granted the authority to observe and inspect any violations of the CPTED
inspection criteria. Rental housing that changes ownership will be required to
be reinspected before a new residential rental license can be issued unless
otherwise excepted by the Director of Public Safety. Residential inspection
requirements of the residential rental license program are an independent
obligation applicable to rental housing and are in addition to, not in lieu of,
occupancy inspections required by the city’s Property Maintenance Code.
   (E)   No license shall be issued or renewed unless the owner agrees in the
application to such occupancy inspection as may be required to determine
whether the rental housing in connection with which such license is sought is
in compliance with the applicable provisions of the city’s Property Maintenance
Code and with the applicable rules and regulations pursuant thereto, as
outlined in §
150.05.
   (F)   No license shall be issued or renewed unless the completed application
form for each building or group of buildings, identifying the specific units,
is accompanied by payment of the appropriate annual license fee as established
in this chapter. Payments must be made in full prior to the license being
renewed. Failure to pay any balance will serve as grounds to deny further
permits or licenses from being issued by the city.
   (G)   When the city determines after an initial inspection that additional
follow-up inspections are necessary for enforcement of this chapter, the owner
may be assessed a non-compliance inspection service charge as applicable in the
current residential rental license fee schedule.
   (H)   A residential rental license may be issued or renewed for an owner
living more than 50 miles from the city; provided that such owner designates,
in writing, to the city the name of the owner’s local point-of-contact for the
receipt of service or notice of violation of the provisions of this chapter and
for service of process pursuant to this chapter. The local point-of-contact
shall reside within 50 miles of the city.
   (I)   No residential rental license shall be issued or renewed for an owner
unless such applicant has first designated a local point-of-contact for the
receipt of service for violations of the provisions of this chapter, when the
owner is absent from the city for 30 consecutive days or more. Such designation
shall be made in writing.
   (J)   Current residential rental license holders will be provided a notice
of renewal one month prior to the expiration of the present license.
   (K)   No residential rental license shall be transferable to another rental
housing. Every owner holding a residential rental license shall give notice in
writing to the city within seven days after having transferred or otherwise
disposed of the legal control of any licensed rental housing. Such notice shall

life, property or public safety, in which case the suspension or revocation
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted
by the hearing officer or by a court of record on application, or notice to the
Director of Public Safety and on due cause shown.

shall account for and pay over those amounts to the city along with the tax
properly collected.

to the owner and operator and added to the tax. In addition if for any reason
any tax is not paid when due, interest at a rate of 1.5% per month on the
amount of tax which remains unpaid, shall be added to the tax. The city may
bring an action to collect any unpaid tax or penalty and any legal fees and
costs incurred by the city, in the collection of any tax, shall be paid by the
owner or operator.
   (B)   In addition to any late payment penalty or interest, any owner and
operator of the amusement violating any provision of this chapter upon
conviction thereof shall be fined not less than $100 nor more than $750 for
each such offense. Each failure to collect the tax imposed hereby or each
failure to pay such tax over to the city shall constitute a separate violation
thereof.
   (C)   Suspension or revocation of license. Payment and collection of the tax
and any late payment penalty may be enforced by the city by action in any court
of competent jurisdiction. If, after a hearing, it is found that any amusement
owner has willfully evaded its responsibility to collect, account for, and/or
pay over said tax, such finding shall be cause for suspension or revocation of
any city license applicable to the amusement in addition to any other penalty
in this chapter.

reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,

or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   “Obscene” defined. Any material or performance is OBSCENE if:

standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or

such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was

disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold,
engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for
reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of
obscene material.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age; and/or
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

   (A)   The following additional regulations are hereby adopted as
supplementary and in addition to the requirements of the Property Maintenance
Code and are hereby incorporated as if fully set forth therein.
      “(i)   Permit Required. It shall be unlawful for the owner of a parcel of
real estate on which a residential or non-residential structure is situated, to
occupy the structure or permit the occupancy of the structure by any person
without complying with prior thereto Section 6.01(a)(ii). Further, the owner
shall not occupy or allow the occupancy of any existing residential or non-
residential structure, if the Occupancy Permit thereto has been revoked.
      To obtain an Occupancy Permit, the owner must comply with the application
process outlined in Section 6.01(a)(ii) within the prescribed time.
      Once an Occupancy Permit is issued it shall thereafter, except as
provided in Section 6.01(a)(i)(E), be unlawful for the owner to change or allow
a change of occupancy with or without change of ownership of the residential or
non-residential structure without the owner complying with Section 6.01(a)(ii)
prior to the change of occupancy.
      For purposes of this Section 6, “owner” is defined as the person or
entity maintaining fee simple title to the real estate on which the structure
is located at the time of transfer of the title to the real estate to the
transferee or at the time of change in occupancy of the structure situated on
the real estate.
      For purposes of this Section 6, the term “change in occupancy” shall mean
a change in possession of a residential or non-residential structure by way of
rental, leasehold, ownership, or other manner of tenancy.

      (b)   Transfer of a majority interest in a land trust holding title to

Company, Partnership or other entity holding title to the real property.
      A Certificate of Occupancy issued for new or renovated structures by the
code official under section 110.0 of the Building Code and section R110 of the
Residential Code shall be considered and is expressly distinguished from the
Occupancy Permit required pursuant to this Section 6.01(a)(i). However, such
Certificate of Occupancy may be honored as an alternative to the Occupancy
Permit required by Section 6.01(a)(i) and this code, provided the subject
structure otherwise complies with the standards and requirements of this code.
In the absence of such compliance, any building permit fees paid to the City
shall be counted toward the fee required for the Occupancy Permit under the
Property Maintenance Code.
      Any existing structures inspected under this Property Maintenance Code
will not be subject to the requirements of the Building Code or Residential
Code, unless the building is also subject to new construction, alteration,
addition, or relocation requirements, and then only the portion that is
affected by that work. The legal occupancy of any structure existing on the
date of the adoption of this code, or for which it has been heretofore approved
shall be permitted to continue without change, except as is otherwise
specifically covered in this property maintenance code, the building code, or
fire prevention codes or presents a threat to the life, health and safety of
the occupants.
   EXCEPTIONS: The inspection provisions of this Section 6.01(a)(i) shall not

issue of the Occupancy Permit herein required, but not at a longer interval as
required by other sections of this code, provided there is no just cause for
re-inspection of the premises;
      C.   To the change in ownership of a residential or non-residential
structure when the new buyer or transferee within seven (7) days from date of
purchase or transfer, delivers a notarized statement to the Code Official
stating that the buyer/transferee will cause the structure to be demolished
within six (6) months from the date of purchase or transfer.
      D.   To the change in ownership or occupancy of a residential structure
within thirty-six (36) months from the date of issue of a Certificate of
Occupancy for new construction.
      E.   To the change in ownership of any structure when a new owner accepts
all responsibility for obtaining the inspection and an Occupancy Permit
required by Section 6.01(a)(i) and 6.01(a)(ii), provided that the owner or the
new owner submits an application for an Occupancy Permit along with a written
and signed agreement between the owner and new owner, with signatures notarized
that the new owner accepts responsibility for obtaining the inspection and an
Occupancy Permit. The structure may not be occupied until the above documents
have been filed with the Code Official.
   (ii)   Application Process. Application for the Occupancy Permit required by

Once application is made, owner can allow the structure to be occupied, unless
the conditions in exception (a) apply. The property maintenance inspection
required for issuance of an Occupancy Permit must be scheduled within 7 days
after application is made and once the property maintenance inspection is
completed and the owner has been notified of any violations, all violations
shall be corrected within 30 days and a re-inspection scheduled. An extension
of the 30-day period listed above can be obtained, with due cause, only after
written request and then by approval of the Code Official.
         (a)   If the property is sold/purchased “As Is” or if the structure
has not been occupied for a period of 6 months or more then the initial
inspection must be completed and all life safety violations must be corrected
before the structure can be occupied. This type inspection can be scheduled to
be performed within 2 business days of the request. Once the life safety

Agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard area (“SFHA”) within
a community.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (“FPE”). The elevation of the base flood plus one
foot of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
   FLOODPLAIN and SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (“SFHA”) are synonymous. Those
lands within the jurisdiction of the city, the extraterritorial jurisdiction of
the city or that may be annexed into the city, that are subject to inundation
by the base flood. The floodplains of the city are generally identified as such
on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of the county, prepared by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated November 5, 2003.

      (3)   Ensure that the building protection requirements for all buildings
subject to §
152.07 are met and maintain a record of the “as-built” elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) or floodproofing certificate;
      (4)   Assure that all subdivisions and annexations meet the requirements
of §
152.08;
      (5)   Ensure that water supply and waste disposal systems meet the public
health standards of §
152.09;
      (6)   If a variance is requested, ensure that the requirements of §
152.09 are met and maintain documentation of any variances granted;
      (7)   Inspect all development projects and take any and all actions
necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter;
      (8)   Assure that applicants are aware of and obtain any and all other
required local, state and federal permits;
      (9)   Notify IDNR/OWR and any neighboring communities prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse;
      (10)   Provide information and assistance to citizens upon request about
permit procedures and floodplain construction techniques;
      (11)   Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to
coordinate base flood data and to improve the administration of this chapter;
      (12)   Maintain for public inspection base flood data, floodplain maps,
copies of state and federal permits and documentation of compliance for
development activities subject to this chapter;
      (13)   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter,
including post damage site inspections in order to make substantial damage
determinations on structures within the floodplain; and
      (14)   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain data and maps, including the
notification of IDNR/OWR and submitting information to FEMA within six months
whenever a modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation
or result in a change to the FIRM.
(Prior Code, § 152.04) (Ord. 3210, passed 11-3-2003)
§ 152.05 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (A)   No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by
state law shall commence any development in the floodplain without first
obtaining a development permit from the Community Development Department. The
Community Development Department shall not issue a development permit if the
proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      (2)   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      (3)   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to

   (C)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the Community
Development Department shall compare the elevation of the site to the base
flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by survey
data to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the date of the
site’s first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the floodplain
and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely,
any land shown to be below the base flood elevation and which is hydraulically
connected to the flooding source, but not shown on the flood insurance rate map
shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. The Community Development
Department shall maintain documentation of the existing pre-development ground
elevations and certification that the ground elevations existed prior to the
date of the site’s first flood insurance rate map identification.

   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
(Prior Code, § 152.10) (Ord. 3210, passed 11-3-2003)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or
failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed
to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Community
Development Department may determine that a violation of the minimum standards
of this chapter exists. The Community Development Department shall notify the
owner, in writing, of such violation.
      (1)   If such owner fails, after ten days’ notice, to correct the
violation:
         (a)   The county shall make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
         (b)   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not less than $75 nor more than $750 or as provided for by
the violation of the ordinances of the city;
         (c)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day
during or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
         (d)   The county shall record a notice of violation on the title of
the property.
      (2)   The Community Development Department shall inform the owner that
any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and,
therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
   (B)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

§ 154.024 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE OR BOND.
   (A)   All developers shall post with the City Engineer a performance
guarantee in the form of a good and sufficient cash bond or irrevocable letter
of credit (or other guarantee acceptable to the city) and deposit agreement in
a form prescribed by the city (“performance guarantee”) after final plat
approval but before recording, within the time requirements set forth in §
154.022, and before construction of the improvements is started. Such
performance guarantee shall be in an amount equal to 100% of the City
Engineer’s approved estimate of cost of properly and fully completed
construction and installation of all improvements (“estimated costs”) intended
to be dedicated to the city, any public entity or public or private utility for
maintenance and operation and such other improvements required on the final
improvements as designated by the City Engineer.
   (B)   The performance guarantee amount shall cover expenditures, including,
but not limited to, reasonable inspection fees and professional review fees of
the city, installation and maintenance of improvements (including landscaping
and street trees, where applicable), stormwater detention/retention, survey
monumentation and soil erosion and sediment control measures, and such other
improvement obligations required herein, for a two-year period after
inspection, approval and acceptance by the city, if applicable, as specified by
the city, as well as engineering and inspection costs to cover the cost of
failure or repair of improvements installed on the site, all to be borne by the
applicant, and necessary to conform to the requirements established and
conditioned upon completion of the requirements set forth in this chapter. As
public improvements are completed, a pro rata amount of the performance
guarantee may be reduced upon approval by the City Engineer. Performance
guarantees for development performance and maintenance may be separate. Where
permanent maintenance will be assumed by an agency or entity other than the
developer, the time period of the maintenance performance guarantee should be
limited accordingly. The City Engineer may draw funds from the guarantee to
remedy any failure of the developer to meet the performance guarantee
obligations; provided that, except in emergencies, prior written notice shall
be provided to the developer to reasonably allow for the developer to remedy
the deficiency.
   (C)   In accordance with the above, the developer shall submit a detailed
engineer’s estimate to the City Engineer for review and approval. The estimate
shall include quantities of each individual work items and an estimated unit
price. Performance of work necessary to complete construction and installation
of the required improvements to be dedicated to the city shall be within two
years of the date of approval of the final plat, unless such time is extended
by written mutual consent of the subdivider and the city. If such improvements
are not satisfactorily installed within the time constraints imposed herein,
then such guarantee or bond shall be forfeited by the subdivider, and the
surety shall be used to complete and/or install such improvements in accordance
with the requirements specified herein.
   (D)   In lieu of the performance guarantee required above, the city may, at
its discretion, permit the developer to install certain improvements by posting
a construction guarantee in an amount of 10% of the estimated costs (but such
guarantee to be not less than $50,000) of these certain improvements to be
completed and inspected to the satisfaction of the city prior to recording of
the final plat; provided that the developer also posts the full guarantee
required for all improvements not being completed prior to recording and such
guarantee includes an amount for all maintenance and warranty obligations for
all improvements as required by this section. Such specific improvements
proposed for immediate construction with a 10% construction guarantee shall be
noted on the final plat and shall be completed for inspection not later than 12
months after Council approval of the final plat. Where the developer requests
this alternative, the final plat shall not be signed by any city
representative, nor may it be recorded until the City Engineer has inspected
such completed improvements and approved such recording in writing to the
Mayor. If such improvements are not completed within the 12-month period
required herein, or unless such time is extended by the Council, the final plat
approval shall be void and shall provide no authorization of any kind. After
Council approval, but prior to recording of the final plat, the city shall have
all rights of access, testing and inspection as it would after the final plat
is recorded. Where the subdivision is completed in multiple plats, any
improvements attributable to or for the benefits of all plats shall be
completed or guaranteed as part of the first final plat.
   (E)   Where a performance guarantee otherwise fully satisfying the purpose
of this section is posted by the developer with the county, the Council may
waive in whole or in part the required placement of a performance guarantee
with the city; provided that, prior to final plat approval, the developer
provides to the city a performance guarantee otherwise in compliance with this
chapter in the amount of 10% of the estimated costs, to guarantee both
completion of improvements and the warranty period. Upon annexation of any
subdivision into the city prior to completion and release of all improvements,
the developer shall transfer to the city or replace with the city the
performance guarantee posted with the county, and the Council may require the
developer to post a new performance guarantee to ensure that any improvements
meet the requirements of this chapter.

§ 154.025 CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE AND FINAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All improvements in the proposed subdivision or part thereof intended
to be dedicated to the city for maintenance and operation shall be constructed
and/or installed within two years of the date of final plat approval in
accordance with the requirements specified herein, and such improvements shall
not be considered as completed until officially approved and accepted by the
City Engineer conditioned on any modification required by the City Council as a
part of final plat approval. Construction plans and specifications for such
improvements shall be provided by the subdivider on final improvement plans at
the time that the final plat is submitted to the City Council.
   (B)   Such plans shall include improvements as required by the City
Engineer. The plans and profiles of all streets, storm and sanitary sewers,
waterlines and drainage structures together with their drainage area shall be
prepared on standard plan and profile sheets and shall bear the seal and
signature of the registered professional engineer responsible for their
preparation. A cross-section of the proposed streets shall be included showing
the widths of roadways, location and width of sidewalks and the location of
underground utilities. The plans shall show the lines of all proposed sidewalks
and the location of all proposed street lights.
   (C)   The plans, cross-sections and specifications for the proposed
improvements shall be submitted to and approved by the City Engineer prior to
submission to the City Council with the final plat. Four black or blue line
prints of the approved documents shall be included with the final plat
submission. After the completion of the construction of the improvements, a set
of reproducible cloth or polyester base film (Mylar) positives and a digital
file in a format acceptable to the city showing the as-built details and
changes, if any, shall be filed with the city.
   (D)   The developer shall provide and honor a two-year full warranty against
defects in materials and workmanship for the completed work. The term shall
commence immediately after the final inspection punch list items have been
addressed by the developer and approved by the City Engineer. The original
performance guarantee will not be released prior to the commencement of the
two-year warranty term. The warranty period shall be secured with a performance
guarantee in the amount of 10% of the estimated costs. If a separate warranty
and maintenance bond is not provided at the time of final plat approval, the
construction bond shall guarantee these obligations and any pro rata release
for each improvement shall withhold the 10% amount necessary to meet these
obligations.
(Prior Code, § 154.025) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.026 INSPECTIONS AND ACCEPTANCE.
   (A)   All public improvements proposed to be made under the provision of
this chapter will be inspected during the course of construction by the city’s
duly designated representative. The developer shall inform the City Engineer or
his or her duly authorized representative prior to the construction of, and
upon the completion of, each phase of construction of said public improvement
(s). All fees and costs connected with such inspections and tests, and in
reviewing the plans and specifications for such improvements shall be paid by
the developer at a rate to be determined by the City Engineer and as approved
by the City Council. All subdivision inspections, including plan review and all
associated review, performance and inspection fees, shall be applicable and
enforced within the city and within one and one-half miles beyond the corporate
limits.
   (B)   The city reserves the right to retain outside expertise for performing
special inspections. In these instances, the city shall select the outside
inspection consultant and coordinate their work. The cost for such special
inspections shall be borne by the applicant. No land, property interest or
improvement dedicated to the city on a recorded final plat shall be deemed
accepted by the city for purposes of public maintenance or liability until
acceptance for such purposes shall have been specifically approved by
subsequent formal written order signed and dated by the City Engineer and
Mayor.
(Prior Code, § 154.026) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.027 QUALITY ASSURANCE.
   City inspections will be made periodically to ensure that the subdivision is
being constructed substantially in accordance with the approved plans on file
and the city’s Development Manual. The developer is responsible for quality
assurance checks on the work, to include both on-site inspection and
appropriate testing. City inspections are not to be construed as relieving the
developer of any part of his or her responsibility for quality assurance of the
work.

(Prior Code, § 154.042) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
PARK LANDS DEDICATION
§ 154.055 INTENT; SCOPE.
   (A)   The intent of this legislation is to maintain the existing high
quality of life for present and future residents by preserving open space for
public parks without raising taxes and by placing the responsibility for these
services on the subdivision developments that create the need for recreational
and other open space and that cause the impact on existing resources. This
legislation is intended to provide the city with a financing mechanism for
developing and maintaining a safe and clean park system, which meets the
recreational and leisure needs of the residents of the city. The requirements
herein are supported by a legislative determination of impact and need,
including as reflected in the city’s parks plan, market value study and park
dedication study, undertaken to ensure that the requirements imposed are not
more than those necessary to address impacts specifically attributable to the
applicable subdivision.
   (B)   As a condition of approval of any subdivision, as defined herein,
authorizing new residential lots or units, to the extent the requirements of
this subchapter have not already been satisfied, within the corporate limits of
the city, or within the planning jurisdiction of the city (being one and one-
half miles outside the corporate limits), the subdivider shall dedicate real
property on-site, or equivalent real property off-site acceptable to the city,
or make a cash payment in lieu of land dedication, or a combination of both, at
the option of the city, for parks and open space to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of the development or redevelopment. Such
dedication or payment shall be (“land/cash contribution”) in a total amount
sufficient to satisfy the criteria and formula contained within this
subchapter.
   (C)   (1)   Unless otherwise agreed, in writing, between the developer and
city, any land to be dedicated for park or recreational purposes shall be
platted, dedicated and improved as part of the first phase of any subdivision.
Dedication deeds and plats shall be in such form as required by the City
Attorney and required by the city for acceptance.
      (2)   Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the city to accept any
dedication of land until express action by the city accepting such dedication
for maintenance purposes.
(Prior Code, § 154.055) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.056 COMPLIANCE.
   No subdivision approval for activity subject to this subchapter shall be
granted without compliance to this subchapter, except where it may otherwise be
required by law; provided, however, this subchapter shall not apply to any
subdivision that has already received preliminary plat approval by the city as
of November 1, 2004 and for which the final plat is thereafter consistent with
the approved preliminary plat.
(Prior Code, § 154.056) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.057 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRED PARK AND RECREATION LAND DEDICATION.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The land dedication required herein shall be six acres per 1,000
new residents, derived from the following calculation.

Notes to Table:
*Calculations are based on information provided for O’Fallon City, IL by the
United States Census Bureau, Census 2000 (www.census.gov). Data was taken from
Table H33. TOTAL POPULATION IN OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS BY TENURE BY UNITS IN
STRUCTURE and divided by H32. TENURE BY UNITS IN STRUCTURE. Example: detached
single-family data give 16,514 residents (H33) living in 4,962 detached units
(H32). 16,514 people/4,692 units = 2.83.
 
   (C)   Certain area required. No park dedication shall be less than three
contiguous acres unless otherwise approved by Council.
   (D)   General requirements for land contributions. Unless otherwise waived,
real property to be dedicated to the city shall conform to the following
criteria. The city reserves the right to reject at will any parcel offered for
dedication.
      (1)   Location. The location of any dedicated land shall only be as
approved by the city, consistent with the following guidelines:
         (a)   Locations shall generally conform with the city’s park master
plan, the general location of park sites;
         (b)   Neighborhood park sites should be accessible to the public and
designed to serve a population within one-half to one mile radius from the
site;
         (c)   Park sites should be located in conjunction with and adjacent to
school sites whenever possible and desirable; and
         (d)   Community parks are intended to serve a broader area and should
be located and designed to offer a greater variety of facilities and
activities. These parks should typically be located on arterial or collector
streets.
      (2)   Topography and soils. Park sites must possess suitable topography
and soil types for the use to which they are dedicated. The developer shall
supply the city with soils information in sufficient detail to determine
suitability for dedication. The developer shall also provide the city with a
Phase I Environmental Study and any hazardous materials found on the site shall
be removed by the developer prior to conveyance.
      (3)   Stormwater and surface water detention or retention areas.
Stormwater and surface water detention and retention areas will be accepted at
the discretion of the city and not count towards the total land dedication.
      (4)   Wetlands and other natural areas. Wetland and other natural areas
will be considered acceptable only when they are considered significant in
size, quality and uniqueness; contain endangered plants or animal species; or
are adjacent to existing natural areas currently owned by the city. Wetland
areas will be accepted at the discretion of the City Council. Any such wetland
area accepted by the city shall not count towards the total land dedication
required herein; provided that exceptional wetland designs or accompanying
amenities may be given partial or full credit toward the greenspace
requirements at the discretion of the Council.
      (5)   Private open space and recreation land. Credit may be granted at
the discretion of the Council towards the total land/cash contribution for
suitable private open space or recreation land and/or recreational improvements
thereon or on public space provided within the subdivision; provided that:
         (a)   Such total credit shall not exceed 50% of the land/cash
contribution obligation;
         (b)   Any credit for improvements shall not exceed 10% of the land/
cash contribution; and
         (c)   All credited private lands and improvements shall otherwise
comply with the requirements of this subchapter.
      (6)   Dimensions. Sites should be generally square to rectangular in
shape with dimensions generally proportionate to the ratio of a depth of
between one to one and three to two (1:1 and 3:2). These criteria shall not
apply to sites contemplated for extraordinary types of facilities, such as, but
not limited to, trails and shore line frontages.
      (7)   Street frontage. Park space shall have a minimum street frontage of
50 feet, and should generally be centrally located within a development.
      (8)   Access. Access to park sites and connections to other park sites
are to be provided by way of open access ways between homes and/or from public
right-of-way. The access ways should be a minimum of 50 feet.
      (9)   Drainage. Except for stormwater and surface water drainage
facilities servicing the park facilities constructed on the site, detention or
retention basins for stormwater drainage from the surrounding development will
not be located on or adjacent to park sites unless approved by the city.
      (10)   Networks. Open space shall be laid out in general accordance with
the open space, greenway and riparian networks as depicted in the comprehensive
plan.
      (11)   Certain open space. Long, narrow strips of open space are
discouraged, except where designated to protect linear sources, such as streets
or trails, or to provide connections between larger open space areas.
   (E)   Improvements required for land dedication. Park sites to be dedicated
by developer shall include the following land improvements.
      (1)   Utilities. Each dedicated park site shall be provided with the
following utilities to the property line.
         (a)   Sanitary sewer adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of eight
inches in diameter. If the sanitary sewer is across the right-of way from the
park site, the developer shall provide a capped six-inch minimum diameter
service line to the property line, accessible by a manhole where necessary and
as approved by the city.
         (b)   Waterline adjacent to the site shall be a minimum of six inches
in diameter. If the waterline is across the right-of-way from the park site,
the developer shall provide a capped one-inch minimum diameter waterline to the
property line, as approved by the city, and unless otherwise requested for a
special facility.
         (c)   Storm sewers shall be provided at appropriate locations to
properly drain the park site, as approved by the city.
         (d)   Other utilities, such as electric, gas and telephone, shall be
provided adjacent to or at the property line of the park site. The utility
extension for any development adjacent to the park site shall be at the cost of
the developer and the city shall be responsible solely for utility extensions
necessary to construct a park facility. The city shall not be responsible for
utility extensions for any other purpose.
      (2)   Grading. Except for natural areas designated by the city for
retention in a non-disturbed state, each dedicated park site shall be graded to
drain at a minimum of 2% for open areas and slopes on berms, when berms are
required, shall not exceed 4:1 (3:1 or steeper shall be deemed unacceptable).

one full growing season;
         (b)   The developer may, at the discretion of the Council, make the
following cash contribution in lieu of the required improvements to park land:
the sum of $51,000 per acre or proportional amount thereof for fractional
portions of an acre; or such other amount as established by the Council

(Prior Code, § 154.057) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.058 RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LANDS.
   Whenever the city’s comprehensive plan or the standards established by the
city indicates that a larger site than that required of the developer is to be
dedicated by this subchapter, and said site is wholly within the proposed
subdivision, the city may request a reservation of additional property
adjoining the dedication site for subsequent purchase for park purposes. Such
request shall include the designation of specific property to be reserved on
the final plat and labeled a letter of intent stating the city’s intent to
purchase the property at the fair market value at the time of final subdivision
approval. The failure of the city to initiate acquisition proceedings within 60
days of notice by the city shall cause the termination of the “reserved”
designation and will release said property for further development within the
subdivision regulations of the city.
(Prior Code, § 154.058) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.059 CRITERIA FOR A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF PARK SITES.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Where the development is small and the resulting park site is too
small to be practical or is undesirable to the developer, or when no available
land is appropriate for a park site as determined by the city, the city may
require the subdivider or the developer to pay a cash contribution partly or
wholly in lieu of the land dedication. A cash contribution in lieu of park site
dedications shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land on
site improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as a
park site. Such improvements shall include consideration of grading, streets,
water and sewer systems, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, electrical service,
street trees and streetlights.
      (2)   It has been determined based on the market value study placed on
file with the City Clerk that the present fair market value of such improved
land suitable for park space in and around the city within the planning
jurisdiction of the city, including the one and one-half mile extraterritorial
planning jurisdiction outside the city’s boundaries at the time of dedication,
is $51,000 per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculations
relating to this policy until evidence dictates raising or lowering this amount
based on a revision to the market study approved by the Council; provided that
verified submission of a completed sale contract value (plus improvement costs
as determined by the city) of the development site within the prior 24 months
shall be accepted as an alternative value. In the event that a subdivider or
developer files a written objection with the City Clerk objecting to said fair
market value figure, and in the event that negotiations fail to achieve an
acceptable alternative, the said fair market value of the development site
dedication shall be determined by three qualified appraisers, one of whom shall
be appointed by the City Council, or by its duly appointed committee or
commission, one of whom shall be appointed by the subdivider or developer, and
one of whom shall be mutually agreed upon by the said two appraisers so chosen.
The fees and costs of such appraisal shall be borne equally by the city and the
subdivider or developer.
   (B)   Dedications required. The dedications of land required by this section
shall be made prior to the final platting of 50% of the lots approved in the
preliminary plat, and cash contributions required by this section shall be made
on a pro rata basis at the time of application for building permit for each lot
in the development; provided that if land dedication or fee in lieu obligations
are not satisfied in full on or before the date of the approval of the first
final plat, then such obligation shall be included in and secured by the
improvement guarantee held by the city. Further, the dedications or
contributions required under this section shall be applicable and due when a
division of property or development or redevelopment of property occurs which
creates lots or dwelling units in addition to the number of lots or dwelling
units existing as of the effective date of this chapter and in such cases shall
be paid upon application for building permit for each additional dwelling unit.
In the case of land dedication, the developer shall agree to maintain the
property in accordance with all the laws of the city until such time as the
land is formally accepted by the city. Improvements to any dedicated land shall
be secured by a bond or letter of credit in an amount and form acceptable to
the city at the time of final plat.
   (C)   Review of present market value and density formula. The present fair
market value and density formula affecting this section shall be reviewed by
the City Council as needed to ensure the requirements continue to reflect the
requirements and policies of this subchapter. After said review, any
appropriate changes may be made to the formula by the City Council.
   (D)   Exception. This section is not intended to apply to lands of
subdividers or developers who have entered into an agreement with the city for
annexation of those lands, or for the use of those lands in a planned
development, where such agreement would be violated by imposition of this
section to such lands; provided that this section shall be fully enforceable
against those lands where the annexation agreement or the planned unit
development agreement may have expired and become void because the lands
affected were not developed within the time provided for in said agreements.
   (E)   Title insurance, survey, assessment plats. Each deed or other
instrument conveying land to the city shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   A commitment for a standard Form B ALTA owner’s policy of title
insurance issued by a title insurer licensed to do business in the state to
ensure the intended grantee’s title to such real estate in an amount equal to
its value computed pursuant to this subchapter, subject only to the general
real estate taxes which are not due and payable at the time of delivery of the
deed, covenants, conditions and restrictions of record which do not prohibit or
materially interfere with the use of the subject real estate for park and
recreational use;
      (2)   A current land survey of the subject real estate with all corners
staked, prepared by a state registered land surveyor and certified to the
intended grantee as meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements of both an
American Land Title Association (“ALTA”) survey and the state’s land survey
standards; and
      (3)   Except in instances where the real estate to be conveyed has
assigned to it a permanent index number or numbers which do not cover any other
real estate, an assessment plat and tax division petition in form acceptable to
the appropriate county authorities so that the land to be conveyed can be
assigned its own permanent real estate index number for exemption purposes.
(Prior Code, § 154.059) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.060 LIMITATIONS; APPEALS.
   Nothing in this subchapter shall be interpreted, applied or enforced to
impose a taking of land without compensation or to cause any other violation of
law. In any circumstance where the dedication is either not consented to, or
constitutes and unreasonable burden, is not specifically attributable to the
park dedication or green space needs generated by the development, or is
otherwise claimed to be unlawful, the applicant shall file an appeal within 15
days of adoption of any such requirement before the city where the facts of
such claims shall be presented under such formal hearing process as is
otherwise provided for variance appeals. The applicant shall state the specific
basis and facts supporting the claim, including such additional relevant
information as may be requested by the hearing officer. No decision of the city
shall be deemed ripe or final until 30 days after the decision by the hearing
officer on such claim, which shall be limited to a declaration as to whether
the requirement is lawful under the facts presented and a recommendation as to
final action. During the 30-day period, the City Council shall have
jurisdiction to repeal, modify or maintain the requirement by enactment of an
ordinance amending the specific ordinance imposing the requirement to the
applicant’s property, if so applicable.
(Prior Code, § 154.060) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 154.075 WAIVER AND EXCEPTIONS.
   The City Council may grant an exception or deviation from any provision
herein and included in the Development Manual, except for lot area and
dimensions as set forth in the Development Manual. When a developer can show
that a provision of this chapter would cause unnecessary hardship, if strictly
adhered to, and when, in the opinion of the Commission or Council, because of
conditions peculiar to the site, a departure may be made without destroying the
general intent and spirit of this chapter, the Commission may recommend and the
Council may approve a waiver or modification. The developer shall apply in
writing for such waiver or modification. Final approval of the waiver or
modification shall only be as expressly set forth by the Council by ordinance,
usually as part of the ordinance approving the final plat of the subdivision.
(Prior Code, § 154.075) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.076 APPEALS.
   (A)   Except as where otherwise provided, any person aggrieved by any
decision so as to have standing in a court of law may appeal the decision of
the Director or other official relating to an application filed or permit
issued pursuant to or provided for in this chapter, to a hearing officer
appointed by the Mayor (“hearing officer”).
   (B)   The following procedures shall be applicable to all such appeals.
      (1)   Verified application. The applicant shall submit a written request
with the City Clerk for review on a form approved by and acceptable to the
hearing officer no later than ten days following the decision being appealed.
      (2)   Notice. Upon receipt of a complete appeal request and fee for a
hearing, the hearing officer shall give notice to the applicant, include in its
agenda and hold a hearing (or designate another body to do so), after giving
five days’ notice thereof. The hearing officer shall render a decision within
30 days after the hearing.
      (3)   Hearing procedures; fees. The claims shall be presented under such
formal hearing process as is otherwise provided for variance appeals as
determined by the hearing officer and the city may set reasonable fees for
processing appeals and conducting hearings.
      (4)   Court filing. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, no
action may be filed in any court prior to compliance with the requirements of
this section and full exhaustion of the appeal remedy provided herein.
(Prior Code, § 154.076) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)

   (B)   No subdivision plat or re-plat shall be filed for record or recorded
in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds unless and until the approval of
the City Council is endorsed thereon by the City Clerk. No lot shall be sold

Council and filed for record in the office of the County Recorder of Deeds, as
herein provided.
   (C)   The City Clerk shall file the approved final plat and order or
resolution with the County Recorder of Deeds, not more than 30 days from the
date of posting of, and not prior to the posting of, the performance guarantee

no such permits shall be issued prior to final completion and approval of all
streets, all water, sewer and stormwater infrastructure and general site
grading.
(Prior Code, § 154.078) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.079 ENFORCEMENT; STOP-WORK ORDER, REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   In the event any person holding a site development permit or
infrastructure permit pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the
permit, or carries on-site development in such a manner as to materially
adversely affect the health, welfare or safety of persons residing or working
in the neighborhood of the development site or so as to be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in
the neighborhood, the Director may suspend or revoke the site development
permit and the City Engineer may suspend or revoke the infrastructure permit.
   (B)   (1)   Suspension of a permit shall be by a written stop-work order
issued by the Director and delivered to the permittee or his or her agent or
the person performing the work.

   If any section, division, clause or phrase of this chapter is for any reason
held to be unconstitutional or void, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. To that end, the provisions
and sections of this chapter shall be deemed to be severable, and the
invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the
remainder. No obligation placed on the city by the provisions of this chapter
that is above and beyond the express requirements of state law shall be
considered mandatory, but shall be deemed directory or permissive in nature in
that those provisions merely direct a manner of conduct for the guidance of the
officials and/or a general time period for their performance of their official
duty; nor shall any failure of the city to comply with any requirement of the
city herein invalidate an action taken by the city unless the action is
expressly invalidated by the requirements of state law.
(Prior Code, § 154.080) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.081 REPEAL OF CONFLICTING REGULATIONS.

and conditions under which preliminary plats approved prior to the adoption of
this chapter shall be binding and in effect; except that the rights and
privileges conferred upon the developer in §
154.020 shall be applicable. This chapter shall not be construed to be in
conflict with any state or federal law intended to control erosion and
sedimentation. In those instances where state or federal law imposes a duty or
requirement with respect to a matter covered by this chapter, the more
environmentally stringent duty or requirement shall control.
(Prior Code, § 154.081) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 154.082 FEES.
   The City Council may adopt, by separate resolution, appropriate fees for

development and infrastructure permits and other permits provided subject to
this chapter, as well as subdivision inspection fees, utility service and tap
fees and any additional costs, studies and fees as may be required consistent
with this chapter and the Development Manual. Such fees may be established in
such amount so as may fully reimburse the city’s costs in administering this
chapter, each application and any enforcement thereof.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.001 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   The following are the minimum development standards of the city and
shall apply to all developments subject to the city’s Subdivision and
Development Control Ordinance. Unless lawfully waived or varied in writing,
failure to conform any development or subdivision subject to the Subdivision
and Development Control Ordinance (“ordinance”) to the terms of this
Development Manual (“manual”) shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter
punishable as set forth therein. This chapter establishes minimum requirements
to provide for the coordinated, efficient and economic development of the city;
to ensure the adequacy of street and utility facilities; and to promote the
public health, safety and welfare; and to implement the city’s comprehensive
plan. If any other provision of law relates to any matter covered herein, the
regulation providing the higher, stricter standard shall apply.
   (B)   Terms used herein shall have the meaning set out in the definitions
section of the city’s Zoning Code and/or Development Code or, if not defined
therein, shall have the customary and ordinary meaning in the context.
(Prior Code, § 155.001) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN
§ 155.015 GENERAL STATEMENT.
   The subdivider shall conform to the following principles and standards of
land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or portion thereof. No
preliminary plat shall be approved unless it conforms to the following minimum
standards of design. IDOT (State Department of Transportation) standards and
polices shall be followed for all street design and construction, except as
modified by this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 155.015) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.016 UTILITY EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Easements of not less than ten feet in width shall be provided on each
side of all rear lot lines, and alongside lot lines where necessary for storm
and sanitary sewers, water and drainage swales. Separate rear and side lot
easements are required for other public utilities. Easements of greater width
may be required for adequate access along or across lots when necessary for the
extension of main sewers where both water and sewer lines are located in the
same easement, at the discretion of the City Engineer. Easements of not less
than 15 feet in width shall be provided in front of all lots for sanitary
sewer, water and other utilities.
   (B)   Adequate easements for stormwater drainage shall be established along
any natural drainage channel and in such other locations as may be necessary to
provide satisfactory disposal of stormwater from streets, alleys and all other
portions of the subdivision. The location and minimum widths of such easements
shall be determined by the City Engineer.
   (C)   No private tree, shrub, fence, building, other structure or sprinkler
system shall be placed or erected in any easement for utility, access or
drainage purposes, except at the owner’s risk as to all costs for demolition,
removal and reconstruction. The proper authorities may have free access to and
use of the easements at any time. No fence or structure shall impede the free
flow of surface water across any lot with an easement.
   (D)   No brick mailboxes, decorative walls, sprinkler systems, private
landscaping or other permanent structure protruding above the natural ground
level shall be located within any easement or public rights-of-way unless
authorized by the City Engineer, and only at the owner’s risk as to all costs
for demolition, removal and reconstruction.
   (E)   All easements shall be aligned such that existing, and any future,
utilities or drainage facilities can be extended beyond the boundaries of the
subdivision.
   (F)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a natural watercourse,
drainageway, wetland, channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage
easement, conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse. It shall
include an additional width, adjoining both edges of the established area that
encompasses the 100-year floodplain. Required width shall be approved by the
City Engineer.
   (G)   All utility distribution lines for telephone and electric service
shall be installed underground within general utility easements and dedicated
public rights-of-way.
   (H)   Easements shall be clearly identified on all plats (e.g., drainage
easement or utility easement). Easements shall be marked noting location, width
and nature of the easement.
   (I)   No utility pedestals or transformers shall be located within 15 feet
of city utilities.
   (J)   All easements for city utilities shall be in such form as approved by
the city and shown as such on the plat. All other easements shall include the
city as a beneficiary and shall be shown on such plat in such form as approved
by the city.
(Prior Code, § 155.016) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.017 BLOCKS.
   (A)   No block shall be longer than 1,400 feet or shall be less than 500
feet in length and no block width shall be less than the minimum required to
meet the applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance governing lot depth.
   (B)   All blocks, whenever it is deemed essential to provide access to
schools, playgrounds, shopping centers and other community facilities, shall
have a crosswalk with a right-of-way of at least ten feet in width near the
center of the block, or as otherwise determined by the City Engineer.
   (C)   The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to building sites, land use, zoning requirements, access, safety and
convenience.
   (D)   Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial or collector, the greater
dimension of the block shall generally front or back upon such arterial or
collector to avoid unnecessary ingress or egress.
(Prior Code, § 155.017) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.018 LOTS.
   (A)   Lot area and dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the
applicable district of the zoning ordinance.
   (B)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
   (C)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
right-of-way lines and radial to curved street right-of-way lines, except where
a variation of this rule will provide a better street and lot design.
   (D)   All remnants of lots below minimum lot area size left over after
subdividing of a larger tract shall be added to adjacent lots, rather than
allowing to remain as unusable land, except when designated for utility
purposes or accepted for public space for park or other public uses.
   (E)   Lots which cannot be served by a public or private sanitary sewage
collection system, and/or a public or private water distribution system, shall
comply with the applicable provisions of the applicable zoning ordinance or
shall be not less than one acre in size per lot or household unit, whichever is
greater. Such lots shall have a width of not less than 125 feet or a depth in
excess of three times its width, unless otherwise permitted and approved by the
city.
   (F)   Double frontage lots should be avoided, except where they are needed
to provide for the separation of residential development from major streets or
to overcome specific disadvantages, topography or orientation.
   (G)   Whenever the back or side yards of a residential development face non-
subdivision streets, a landscape berm as provided for in §
155.076 is required.
   (H)   Corner lots and lots with double frontage shall have extra dimension
sufficient to permit the establishment of front building setback lines on the
adjoining streets.
   (I)   The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide each lot with
satisfactory access to a public street.
   (J)   No grading or excavation shall be permitted within the floodplain or
flood hazard areas without the following:
      (1)   Approval of applicable city, state and federal agencies;
      (2)   Adequate documentation showing that the floodplain revisions will
not cause an increase of flooding of property downstream by showing that the
floodplain storage through the project reach has remained the same or increased
for the ten- and 100-year frequency peak flood levels; and
      (3)   The project floodplain revisions do not cause an increase in
flooding upstream of the proposed development by meeting the State Department
of Natural Resources created head requirements for property upstream of the
proposed project. The city also requires the developer provide survey and
hydraulic analyses, if necessary, showing that the allowable increases do not
cause an increase of flooding of structures or collector roads (or higher
category roads), or acquire flood easements from the parties upstream whose
structures and/or roads (collector level or higher) will experience an increase
of flooding.
   (K)   Any proposed lot which touches a portion of the floodplain, as defined
herein, shall have shown on the final plat a legal description of the portion
of each lot which is in the floodplain, as defined herein.

MINIMUM STANDARDS OF IMPROVEMENTS
§ 155.030 GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (A)   All development and subdivision of land within the city and within the
one and one-half mile area of extraterritorial subdivision jurisdiction shall
conform to the standards adopted within this chapter, as well as the standards
adopted herein by reference.
   (B)   The following standards are herein adopted by reference:
      (1)   State Department of Transportation (“IDOT”) “Standard Specification
for Road and Bridge Construction”;
      (2)   “Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in
Illinois”;
      (3)   IDOT “Drainage Manual”;
      (4)   “Illinois Urban Manual”, dated December 2002 or more recent
publication date. The “Illinois Urban Manual” is a compilation and updating of
the “Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control” (the
Yellow Book), published by the State Environmental Protection Agency; and
      (5)   “Illinois Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control” (the Green Book), prepared by the Northeastern Illinois
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Steering Committee.
   (C)   In the event there exist conflicts among or between any of these
adopted standards and/or the provisions of this chapter and Development Manual,
the stricter standard shall prevail. Three copies of each of these standards
have been on file in the office of the City Clerk for a period of 15 days prior
to the ordinance adopting this manual and shall remain on file in the City
Clerk’s office.
   (D)   The requirements set forth in this Development Manual shall be
considered as minimum requirements, and nothing contained herein shall be
construed to mean that the subdivider cannot construct or provide improvements
of a higher type.
   (E)   All proposed water and sanitary sewer facilities shall comply with the
minimum requirements and recommendations of the State Environmental Protection
Agency, the City Engineer and the City Council. When a proposed subdivision is
reasonably accessible to a public sewer system and/or water distribution
system, the subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a complete sanitary
system and/or water distribution system to be connected to the proper public
system(s). An analysis of the demand for water service and discharge into the
sanitary sewer receiving system may be required by the City Engineer to
determine if there are any significant system wide impacts that may harm the
city’s utility system or services.
   (F)   Upon the city’s review of any development and upon its determination,
communicated to the applicant in writing, that a traffic safety or service
level concern or any other such infrastructure service or public safety concern
may reasonably exist relating to the construction or development to be
permitted by the city, the city may subsequently require the applicant, at
applicant’s cost, to submit a traffic study or such other study as may be
needed to address the identified concern. The city may accept such studies as
presented by the developer, however, the city may require additional studies to
be prepared as necessary to ensure the standards herein are conformed to and
that the public safety and welfare is protected. The city may, at its
discretion, direct the conduct of such studies and may require such studies to
be paid for by the developer/subdivider.
   (G)   The following table sets minimum testing standards for infrastructure
construction in development governed by
Chapter 154.

(Prior Code, § 155.030) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.031 REFERENCE MONUMENTS.
   (A)   Permanent monuments of stone or reinforced concrete with a one-quarter
inch iron rod cast in the center and of suitable size set in such a manner that
they will not be moved by frost shall be placed in the field as required by the
statutes of the state as revised and are in effect at such time.
   (B)   All lot corners shall be marked by one-half inch iron pins not less
than 24 inches in length and driven into the ground and shall not protrude
above the ground surface more than one and one-half inch. The lot corners shall
be installed and certified by a professional land surveyor prior to the release
of the letter of credit.
(Prior Code, § 155.031) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.032 STREET ACCESS, STANDARDS AND IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   The street and alley arrangement shall be such as to not impose undue
hardship upon the owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land
and seek to provide for convenient access thereto. Reserve strips controlling
access to streets are prohibited except where their control is placed with the
City Council.
   (B)   The arrangement of rights-of-way in a subdivision shall provide for
the continuation of the existing streets or rights-of-way in adjoining areas,
unless the city deems such continuation undesirable for reasons of topography
or design. Where subdivision streets or rights-of-way are continuations or
extensions of existing streets or rights-of-way, the width thereof shall be of
the same or greater width as the existing street or right-of-way; except that
in no case shall the street or right-of-way in the subdivision be of less width
than hereinafter provided by the typical cross-section shown on typical cross-
sections hereto attached.
   (C)   Where, in the opinion of the city, it is desirable to provide future
street access to adjoining areas, the streets and rights-of-way in the
subdivision shall be extended to the property line. If deemed necessary by the
city, any temporary dead-end street shall be provided with a temporary turn-
around. Access shall not be denied to any parcel or part of a parcel of ground
by the subdividing of land. When cross-access between properties is provided or
required, it shall be noted on the plat, and recorded ingress-egress easements
shall be provided to the city.
   (D)   Streets shall intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles.
   (E)   Local and collector street curb intersections shall be rounded by
radii of at least 25 feet.
   (F)   Street intersections with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet are
prohibited, unless otherwise permitted and approved by the city.
   (G)   Dead-end streets shall have a length no greater than 800 feet, except
as provided herein. If topography justifies a need for a greater length, dead-
end streets or culs-de-sac designed to be so permanently may be longer than 800
feet and will terminate in a circular open space having a radius at the outside
of the pavement of at least 40 feet and a diameter at the outside of the right-
of-way of at least 100 feet. Temporary dead-end streets may be permitted at a
greater length if the city determines that a through connection is feasible and
likely in the near future and other design requirements are met. Unless
otherwise approved, the developer shall install at the entrance of all dead-end
streets for which the terminus is not visible from the entrance a “no outlet”
sign or other approved signage indicating that the street has no outlet.
   (H)   Local streets shall be designed so as to discourage through traffic.
   (I)   No local street grade shall be in excess of 8% and no collector street
grade shall be in excess of 5%, except as otherwise approved by the city due to
the adverse topographic conditions for adequate drainage. The minimum grade of
any new street shall not be less than 1%, except where vertical curves in the
grade line of the street make this provision inapplicable. A minimum of 500
L.F. of the existing street grade shall be shown from the point of extension
for the new street to aid in evaluating the vertical alignment.
   (J)   The city shall not approve streets which will be subject to frequent
inundation or flooding, per IDOT standards, or as otherwise specified herein.
   (K)   Alleys may be required in multiple-family districts and commercial or
industrial districts unless other definite and assured provision is made for
service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent
and adequate for the use proposed.
   (L)   Dead-end alleys shall not be permitted, except where provided with
adequate turn-around facilities at the dead-end, or where such dead-end alleys
provide the only access to off-street parking.
   (M)   Alleys, where provided, shall have a right-of-way of not less than 20
feet.
   (N)   The minimum right-of-way of local, collector and arterial streets
shall be in accordance with the typical cross-sections hereto attached.
   (O)   Intersection of more than two streets at one point shall be avoided.
   (P)   Where the subdivision abuts on or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the city may require that marginal access streets be provided
in order that no lots front on such existing or proposed arterial street.
   (Q)   Dedication of half-streets shall be discouraged, but may be permitted
whenever there is no other logical method of platting. However, wherever there
exists a dedicated or platted half-street or alley adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be platted, unless
otherwise permitted by the city.
   (R)   (1)   All new streets, which are created and dedicated for use within
a subdivision, shall be graded, drained and surfaced in accordance with the
minimum requirements herein below set forth and in a manner which will provide
complete and adequate drainage of all the streets, alleys and public grounds in
the entire subdivision, including any such work which may be necessary in order
to provide adequate and satisfactory drainage along the side of any existing
public street which lies adjacent to the subdivision.
      (2)   In general, all such new streets within the subdivision and all
work to be undertaken thereon shall be designed and constructed according to
the specifications and policies adopted by the Division of Highways of the
State Department of Transportation, as the same are in effect at the time the
preliminary plat and plans for such improvement work are submitted for
approval.
   (S)   The roadway shall be considered to be that part of the improvement
which lies between the right-of-way lines, which roadway shall be constructed
in accordance with the standards and typical cross-sections as set out in
Appendix B of this chapter.
   (T)   Combination concrete curb and gutters shall be built in accordance
with the detail shown in this manual. The minimum distance from back of curb to
back of curb shall be as shown in the street cross-sections in Appendix B of
this chapter, and all curbs at driveways shall be mountable.
   (U)   All streets within the jurisdictional authority of the city, other
than county and state highways, shall be designed as provided for in this
manual, or as determined by specific needs and designed accordingly. All
streets shall be improved with pavements bounded by integral concrete curbs and
gutters in accordance with the minimum criteria set forth in this manual and
shall be laid out and constructed substantially in accordance with the
standards hereto attached.
   (V)   All new residential driveway aprons must be six-inch PCC concrete. All
other driveway entrances, including multi-family, three-units and above, shall
be constructed to the same pavement thickness as the street it accesses.
   (W)   The earth sub-base shall have not less than 95% of compaction and
shall extend across the entire width of the roadway and two feet behind the
back of curb. In some instances, it might be necessary that the subgrade be
disked or tilled to dry it to the proper moisture content for construction.
   (X)   The developer shall daily clean all mud and dirt from the pavement
surface that has accumulated due to construction work or as a result of
stormwater erosion within the subdivision. No materials, debris, field trailers
and the like shall be stored on the completed pavement or within the recorded
right-of-way lines.
   (Y)   Underground utility lines in street or alley rights-of-way shall be
installed prior to the construction of such streets and/or alleys. All trenches
for utility lines made in the subgrade, and all trenches made outside the
subgrade where the inner edge of the trench is closer than two feet to the edge
of any pavement, shoulder, curb or sidewalk shall be backfilled full depth to
the subgrade elevation with coarse aggregate CA-6 or CA-11. The backfill shall
be compacted by tamping it in eight-inch lifts. Jetting to achieve compaction
will not be allowed.
   (Z)   The city shall have the authority to permit the type, number and
location of all entrances, exits and circulation patterns located on or
accessing any development site or any public or private street within the
city’s jurisdiction.
   (AA)   Where appropriate and as directed by the City Engineer, traffic-
calming measures shall be incorporated to expedite the safe movement of
traffic.
(Prior Code, § 155.032) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.033 SANITARY SEWERS.
   (A)   Each lot in the subdivision shall be provided at the property line
with a connection to a public sanitary sewer system. The termination or termini
of the subdivision sewerage system shall be located at a point acceptable to
the City Engineer. The construction of the sewer system shall conform to the
approved plans and specifications and all work should be properly inspected and
approved by the City Engineer. Trenches shall be backfilled per the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Where connection to a public sanitary sewer system is not feasible,
subdivisions with lots greater than 40,000 square feet may be on a temporary
septic system where standard seepage test or other investigations, conducted by
the Madison or St. Clair County health officials or their representatives,
indicated that the ground in the subdivision is suitable for individual sewage
disposal facilities dependent upon seepage of the effluent into the soil. These
temporary systems may remain until such time that a public sewerage system can
take and treat the wastes. Nothing in this division (B) shall waive the
requirement in division (A) above to construct the on-site collection system in
anticipation of public sewers.
   (C)   Sewer systems and sewage treatment facilities shall meet the
requirements set forth by the State Environmental Protection Agency, State
Department of Public Health, applicable public sewer system and the city. No
oxidation ponds, seepage lagoons or holding lagoons will be permitted. Sanitary
and storm sewer systems shall not be combined. “Package plants” or other
private multi-user treatment facilities are prohibited with the one and one-
half mile extraterritorial subdivision review jurisdiction area.
   (D)   Sewer mains with house service stubs to each lot shall be installed
prior to the construction of street pavements. Service stubs shall be installed
at the centerline of each lot and shall extend to within one foot of the front
lot line. Sewer laterals may not share a common trench.
   (E)   Design of public sewers shall follow the “Standard Specifications for
Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois”, the city’s “Standard
Specifications” and 35 Ill. Admin. Code subtitle C, ch. 2, pt. 370: “Illinois
Recommended Standards for Sewage Works”.
   (F)   In subdivisions not required to install community sewage collection
systems under this section, individual sewage disposal systems may be
permitted.
   (G)   Regardless of locations, lot size or number of lots, a subdivision
shall be disapproved where the city or Madison or St. Clair Counties’
Department of Public Health Official finds that the drainage, soil conditions,
disposal facilities or other conditions will tend to produce health problems.
   (H)   Sanitary sewers shall be extended through the end of all stub streets
and capped. They shall also be extended in such other areas as necessary to
facilitate future extensions for anticipated development.
   (I)   Sanitary sewers shall be noted on dedicated plan and profile sheets or
on a utility plan. Plans shall also include details for manholes, laterals,
trench excavation and any specialties. Profiles shall include grades and pipe
size including manhole tops and inverts. Grading plan shall include finished
floor and basement floor elevations to facilitate review of freeboard
requirements. Where lift stations are included, these shall be detailed with
all relevant piping, structures, pumps and site information.

§ 155.034 WATER.
   (A)   Each subdivision shall have an interconnected public water
distribution system supplying all lots with water from a source approved by the
city and the State Environmental Protection Agency.
   (B)   Each lot in the subdivision shall be provided at the property line
with a connection, including yolk and meter tile, to a water system approved by
the city. The construction of the water system shall conform to the approved
plans and specifications and all work shall be properly inspected and approved
by the City Engineer. Water mains shall be constructed prior to the
construction of street pavements. Trenches shall be backfilled as per the
requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Fire hydrants shall be installed by the subdivider as part of the
water distribution system. Single-family residential developments shall have
fire hydrants spaced at no more than 600 feet from hydrant to hydrant, measured
along the street centerline, or as special site conditions may dictate. Multi-
family residential development hydrant spacing shall not exceed 400 feet, and
high hazard development hydrant spacing shall not exceed 300 feet. No fire
hydrant shall be placed on a main smaller than six inches in diameter.
   (D)   Where fire hydrants or Fire Department connections are located in an
area where vehicles may be parked or standing, said parking or standing shall
be restricted for ten feet in each direction from the hydrant or connection.

(Prior Code, § 155.038) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.039 DRAINAGE, STORM SEWERS AND OTHER DRAINAGE APPURTENANCES.
   (A)   In addition to the installation of curbs or gutters along the streets
as required by this manual, storm sewers and other drainage appurtenances shall
be constructed throughout the entire subdivision to carry off water from all
inlets and catch basins, and be connected to an adequate outfall. The
stormwater drainage system shall be separate and independent of the sanitary
sewer system and shall be in accordance with drainage laws of the city and the
state. Specifically, the flow rate and velocity of post-development stormwater
runoff from the site shall not exceed the flow rate and velocity of pre-
development runoff from the site. Stormwater detention, retention or other BMP
structures shall be designed, constructed and maintained to achieve this.
   (B)   During the final improvement plan phase, the entire subdivision shall
be analyzed for the effects of the 100-year storm to assure that buildings are
properly elevated (lowest structure opening one foot above the 100-year storm
hydraulic gradeline) above the floods occurring beyond the design capabilities
of the stormwater structures. Trenches shall be backfilled as required herein.
   (C)   The developer shall be responsible for constructing adequate
facilities for the control, collection, conveyance, acceptable discharge of
stormwater, other surface water and subsurface water which may be detrimental
to the safe and convenient use of any portion of the area. The storm drainage
system shall provide for runoff from the entire area of the subdivision. It
shall take into account land outside the subdivision limits, which normally
drains across the area of the subdivision as well as the effects of the
subdivision upon downstream drainage systems. As primary focus, the drainage
system for the subdivision shall make use of, protect and improve, as needed,
the natural drainage system. Drainage facilities shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the standards and procedures specified in these
regulations.
      (1)   Design storm. All storm drainage facilities shall be designed with
sufficient capacity and freeboard where necessary to convey the peak rates of
runoff from storms with the average return frequencies listed below.
         (a)   Two-year. Water quality BMPs which will be required in the
future to comply with the city’s NPDES Stormwater Phase II Permit requirements.
         (b)   Ten-year. All drainage facilities within road and easements from
catch basins grates to outlet structures. Pavement encroachment, or maximum in-
street spread, for drainage should be designed according to § 1-303.01 of the
State Department of Transportation Drainage Manual.
         (c)   Twenty-five year. All cross culverts under drives, minor and
local streets, as well as improved streams, swales and ditches. Pavement
encroachment, or maximum in-street spread, for drainage should be designed
according to § 1-303.01 of the State Department of Transportation Drainage
Manual.
         (d)   Fifty-year. All cross culverts and bridges constructed under
residential collector and arterial streets.
         (e)   One-hundred-year. All detention/ retention basins and bridges.
            1.   The lowest opening elevation in all habitable buildings shall
be the 100-year hydraulic gradeline (“HGL”) elevation, plus one foot.
            2.   Drainage ditches, open channels and natural drainageways shall
have zero created head compared with predevelopment conditions at the upstream
property line along said drainageway up to the 100-year flood frequency if any
increase in flooding up to the 100-year frequency storm affects upstream
structures or collector roads (or higher category roads), unless the developer
acquires permanent flood easements to cover the area with increased flooding
levels up to the 100-year flood event from the parties upstream whose
structures and/or roads (collector level or higher) will experience an increase
of flooding.
            3.   Drainage ditches, open channels and natural drainageways which
have no potential to increase flooding upstream of structures or collector
roads (or higher category roads) up to the 100-year event shall not have a
created head greater than 0.1 feet at the upstream property line of the project
property along said drainageway unless easements are obtained from the upstream
property owner to cover the increases of flooding up to 100-year event, or
unless there is a storm sewer, culvert, bridge, dam or other drainage structure
within 200-feet downstream of the upstream property line on said drainageway in
which case the created head shall not be greater than 0.5 feet at the upstream
property line of the project property along said drainageway unless easements
are obtained from the upstream property owner to cover the increases of
flooding up to 100-year event.
      (2)   Stormwater discharge.
         (a)   The discharge of all stormwater shall be into an established
wetlands, watercourse or drainage structure as approved by the city. Where the
discharge shall be into or through private property, proper easements or
drainage rights in a form acceptable to the City Attorney shall be secured by
the developer for the city.
         (b)   Permanent easements, at least 20 feet in width, shall be
provided in all cases where storm drainage facilities are installed in land
other than the street right-of-way. The centerline of pipes shall be no closer
than five feet and the top of the slope for channels shall be no closer than
five feet to the boundaries of the drainage easements. Easements shall also be
provided for storm drainage facilities that may need to be installed in the
future to serve underdeveloped land within the watershed that normally drains
across the area of a proposed development. All easements shall be clearly
delineated and described on the final plat.
      (3)   Other requirements.
         (a)   In all instances, unless otherwise waived, a drainage analysis
map shall be submitted showing the tributary watershed area, sub-drainage
basins and the downstream area affected by runoff. Drainage computations shall
consider the entire tributary area (on-site and off-site) of those drainage
basins contributing runoff to all design points. See also §
155.035.
         (b)   Roadway underdrains shall be required where a soils report
states this is needed, and their installation shall be performed by the
developer and as directed by the city or its duly authorized agent to protect
the stability of the roadway.
         (c)   Suitable head wall or precast end sections shall be provided at
the open end of any pipe. Culverts under streets shall have a minimum cover of
30 inches and shall be extended to a minimum of ten feet from the edge of
pavement, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
         (d)   Catch basins shall be provided so that no portion of any road
shall drain in one direction more than 300 feet without catch basins on both
sides of the road, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
         (e)   The hydraulic capacity and the required size and slope of storm
sewer pipes and channels shall be established by using the Manning equation.
The hydraulic capacity of driveway and roadway cross culverts shall be
established only after considering both the inlet and outlet control
conditions. The lower of the two flow rates obtained shall be the actual rated
capacity. The upstream backwater shall not encroach onto adjacent properties
unless backwater is contained within existing watercourse or wetland limits,
does not encroach upon roadway beyond existing IDOT standards or driveway areas
and the necessary drainage easements are secured from those affected property
owners.
         (f)   House and foundation drains shall in no case be permitted to
discharge onto a roadway surface. Discharge to existing wetlands, watercourses
and storm drainage facilities shall be made. All such drainage connections
shall be made prior to construction of, or be made so as not to cause damage
to, pavement surface. Any damage to roadway or its appurtenances will be the
responsibility of the property owner from whose property the drain is
discharging.
         (g)   All pipes and drainage structures shall be thoroughly cleaned by
the developer before acceptance by the city and again following final
construction of homes or structures within the subdivision. The developer shall
supply a letter of credit to secure such cleaning.
         (h)   Existing wetlands/watercourses proposed to receive storm
drainage discharge shall be analyzed to determine the downstream effects on any
watercourse or existing storm drainage system for its adequacy to receive the
proposed drainage discharge. The extent to which downstream studies are
conducted shall be commensurate with the probable impact of the proposed
development. Where it is anticipated that the additional discharge resulting
from the proposed subdivision will overload the existing downstream drainage
system, the city may deny the subdivision until the applicant has adequately
provided for improvements to the drainage system.
         (i)   Each lot on any final plat or final development plan shall have
identified on the plat of record an elevation height that shall be the minimum
elevation of the lowest opening (first floor, walkout basement or basement
window) to adjacent grade. This elevation shall be determined and established
by the elevation of the 100-year storm in any drainageway or structure adjacent
to that lot or surrounding area that may subject that lot to potential flooding
from any of those drainageways. That elevation will then be required to have
one foot of freeboard. All lots shall be noted on the plat of record as either
suitable or unsuitable for walkout basements.
         (j)   When the street side of any principal structure will be
constructed below roadway elevation, the developer shall submit documentation
from an engineer showing how they propose to protect the structures from
stormwater runoff in excess of the design capacity of the roadway.
         (k)   Detention basins shall be located on outlots maintained by the
homeowner association. A special service area may be created for potential
maintenance by the city should the homeowner association become defunct, unable
or unwilling to provide sufficient maintenance of the detention basins.
         (l)   Additional design standards, as appropriate, may be required by
the City Engineer.
         (m)   Scour protection shall be provided for all ditches and storm
sewer discharges. The amount of scour protection shall be determined by the
flow rate and velocity of the stormwater in the drainage structure.
(Prior Code, § 155.039) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.040 HYDRAULICS.
   Hydraulic calculations for pipes, culverts and open channels are to be as
follows.
   (A)   Gravity versus pressure flow for enclosed systems.
      (1)   Two design philosophies exist for sizing storm drains under the
steady uniform flow assumption. The first is referred to as open channel, or
gravity flow design, in which the water surface within the conduit remains open
to atmospheric pressure. Pressure flow design, on the other hand, requires that
the flow in the conduit be at a pressure greater than atmospheric. For a given
flow rate, design based on open channel flow requires larger conduit sizes than
those sized based on pressure flow. While it may be more expensive to construct
storm drainage systems designed based on open channel flow, this design
procedure provides a margin of safety by providing additional headroom in the
conduit to accommodate an increase in flow above the design discharge. However,
there may be situations where pressure flow design is desirable. For example,
on some projects, there may be adequate headroom between the conduit and inlet/
access hole elevations to tolerate pressure flow. In this case, a significant
cost savings may be realized over the cost of a system designed to maintain
open channel flow. Also, in some cases it may be necessary to use an existing
system which must be placed under pressure flow to accommodate the proposed
design flow rates. Under most ordinary conditions, it is recommended that storm
drains be sized based on a gravity flow criteria at full flow or near full.
Pressure flow design may be justified in certain instances. As hydraulic
calculations are performed, frequent verification of the existence of the
desired flow condition should be made. Storm drainage systems can often
alternate between pressure and open channel flow conditions from one section to
another (from Urban Drainage Design Manual, Hydraulic Engineering Circular No.
22, United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration).
      (2)   For gravity flow conditions, Manning’s Formula shall be used as
described below.
            Q = (1.486)* A * (R2/3)* (S1/2)
                   n
   Where:
   Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second
   A = Cross-sectional area of flow in square feet
   n = Roughness Coefficient (see Table A)
   R = Hydraulic radius (R = A/P) in feet
   S = Slope in feet per foot
   P = Wetted perimeter in feet
   The hydraulic grade line shall be at least one foot below the throat of a
curb inlet, and shall be below the throat of an area inlet, as long as this
inlet is located on grade and has an overflow path to another area inlet. If no
overflow path is available for the area inlet, the hydraulic grade line shall
be at least 1 foot below the throat of the area inlet.
      (3)   In closed conduits flowing under pressure flow, the hydraulic grade
line shall be calculated using the following equation:
p1/g + z1 = p2/g + z2 + hf +hm
   Where:
   p1/g = Pressure head in the upstream system segment in feet
   z1 = Elevation of the system invert in the upstream system segment in feet
   p2/g = Pressure head in the downstream system segment in feet
   z2 = Elevation of the system invert in the downstream system segment in feet
   hf = Friction loss in the downstream system segment in feet
   hm = Minor system losses in the downstream segment in feet
   (B)   Pipe friction losses, hf, may be calculated by the Darcy Formula, the
Hazen-Williams Formula or the friction slope method.
      (1)   Darcy Formula. The most common expression for calculating head loss
due to friction is the Darcy Formula:
hf = f * L * v2
D * 2g
   Where:
   f = The friction factor, determined from the Moody friction factor chart
   L = Length of pipe in feet
   v = Velocity of flow at point of interest in feet per second
   D = Diameter of pipe in feet
   2g = 64.4 feet per second per second
      (2)   Hazen-Williams Formula. Another method for finding the friction
head loss is the Hazen-Williams Formula. The Hazen-Williams Formula gives good
results for liquids that have kinematic viscosities around 1.2 EE-5 ft2/sec
(corresponding to 60°F water). The Hazen-Williams Formula should be used only
for turbulent flow. The Hazen-Williams head loss is:
hf = 3.022 * v1.85 * L
(C1.85 * D1.165)
   Where:
   C = Loss coefficient, determined from H-W chart for various pipe materials
      (3)   Friction Slope Method. This formula is from the FHWA’s Urban
Drainage Design Manual, Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 22.
hf = Sf * L = ((Q * n)/(1.486 * A * R 2/3))2 * L
   Where:
   Sf = Friction slope, ft/ft, which is also the slope of the HGL
   Minor losses, hm, shall be calculated by:
hm = k * v2
2g
   Where:
   k = Coefficient as shown in Table B
      (4)   Manual calculation. A step-by-step procedure for manual calculation
of the EGL using the energy loss method is presented in § 7.5 of the Urban
Drainage Design Manual, Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 22, United States
Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. For most drainage
systems, computer methods such as HYDRA or SWMM are the most efficient means of
evaluating the EGL and designing the system elements.
   (C)   Culverts. Classified as having either entrance or outlet control.
Either the inlet opening (entrance control) or friction loss within the culvert
or backwater from the downstream system (outlet control) will control the
discharge capacity.
      (1)   Entrance control. Entrance control occurs when the culvert is
hydraulically short (when the culvert is not flowing full) and steep. Flow at
the entrance would be critical as the water falls over the brink. If the
tailwater covers the culvert completely (i.e., a submerged exit), the culvert
will be full at that point, even though the inlet control forces the culvert to
be only partially full at the inlet. The transition from partially full to full
occurs in a hydraulic jump, the location of which depends on the flow
resistance and water levels. If the flow resistance is very high, or if the
headwater and tailwater levels are high enough, the jump will occur close to or
at the entrance.
      (2)   Outlet control.
         (a)   If the flow in a culvert is full for its entire length, then the
flow is said to be under outlet control. The discharge will be a function of
the differences in tailwater and headwater levels, as well as the flow
resistance along the barrel length.
         (b)   Alternatively, refer to the Federal Highway Administration
website for these charts (www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/hec05.pdf). Download
applicable design manuals, reports and FHWA hydraulics engineering, such as
Bridge Waterways Analysis Model (“WSPRO”), FHWA Culvert Analysis and HDS 5
Hydraulic Design of Highway Culverts from www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/hydsoft.htm.
These are applicable when flow in the upstream channel is subcritical.
      (3)   Open channels/bridges.
         (a)   Proper evaluation of the velocity, depth and width of flow
requires analyses of the structures and conditions that impact the flow.
Boundary flow conditions upstream and downstream from the open channel system
must be established. The standard-step backwater method, using the energy
equation, can be used to determine the depth, velocity and width of flow. Major
stream obstructions, changes in slope, changes in cross-section and other flow
controls can cause significant energy loss. In these cases, the energy equation
does not apply and the momentum equation must be used to determine the depth,
velocity and width of flow.
         (b)   Hydraulic calculations for open channels may also be made by the
United States Army Corps of Engineer’s “HEC-2 Water Surface Profiles” or “HEC-
RAS River Analysis System” computer programs. The HEC-2 program computes water
surface profiles for one-dimensional steady, gradually varied flow in rivers of
any cross-section. HEC-RAS is an integrated system of software, designed for
interactive use in a multi-tasking, multi-user network environment. The system
has separate hydraulic analysis components, data storage and management
capabilities, graphics and reporting facilities. The HEC-RAS system is intended
for calculating water surface profiles for steady gradually varied flow. The
system can handle a full network of channels, a dendritic system or a single
river reach. Like HEC-2, HEC-RAS is capable of modeling subcritical,
supercritical and mixed flow regime water surface profiles (from
www.hec.usace.army.mil).
(Prior Code, § 155.040) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.041 STORMWATER DETENTION REGULATIONS.
   (A)   If detention basins are necessary, they must be designed in accordance
with the requirements of this chapter and currently accepted engineering design
practices.
   (B)   Included in the design submission must be the following:
      (1)   Map showing site, its location within the watershed and the
watershed limits. All detention facilities shall be analyzed with hydrograph
and storage routing techniques;
      (2)   Examination must be made of the routing of stormwater through the
site and its flow path as it is discharged from the site. Sub-drainage basin
limits within the watershed must be delineated;
      (3)   Designation of the location(s) of the proposed detention basin(s).
Provide analysis for the stormwater runoff from those areas tributary to the
proposed detention facility. Existing and proposed conditions must be
evaluated. Peak storms with return frequencies for the ten-, 25- and 100-year
events shall be analyzed as follows.
         (a)   1.   For detention basins with drainage areas less than 200
acres, the engineer shall use the Rational Method for Detention Storage (also
known as the Modified Rational Method or the Chicago Method) as described in
the State Department for Transportation Drainage Manual under Chapter 4,
Hydrology, and Chapter 12, Detention Storage, and as further defined below.
               a.   Existing and proposed “C” factors for agricultural,
pastures or wooded areas shall be 0.20 or less unless an extensive survey of
soil types and land slopes is presented to verify that a higher value is
justified.
               b.   Existing and proposed “C” factors for paved and building
areas shall be 0.90 or more. This excludes aggregate surfaces which should be
evaluated based on the condition and slope of the aggregate surface.
               c.   Existing and proposed “C” factors for lawns shall be 0.20
or more unless an extensive survey of soil types and land slopes is presented
to verify that a lower value is justified.
               d.   For commercial developments, “C” factors for the proposed
development shall be calculated by a full tabulation of the proposed surface
areas in the development when known, or by calculating the road “C” factor
within the right-of way and by calculating a composite “C” factor based on the
maximum allowed coverage (pavement and building area) per lot for the
development.
               e.   For residential developments, “C” factors for the proposed
development shall be calculated by a composite section of the typical road and
lot configuration showing the average amount of paved and building areas per
lot, and a full tabulation of the park, other green spaces and lakes within the
development.
            2.   Please note that the engineer may also use one of the unit
hydrograph methods as described below for drainage areas under 200 acres if he
or she can demonstrate that sub-watersheds have significantly non-homogeneous
land use or significantly different sub-watershed timing that effect the proper
design of said detention facilities.
         (b)   For detention basins with drainage areas greater than 200 acres,
the engineer shall use a unit hydrograph routing method that is generally
accepted to the State Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water
Resources, such as the Clark or TR-20 unit hydrograph methodologies inside
computer programs such as HEC-1 or HEC-HMS or other computer programs accepted
by the State Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources, and as
further defined below.
            1.   Rainfall data and distributions should be utilized as
described in Bulletin 70 and Circular 173, as published by the State Water
Survey. Enough durations of each required frequency must be run to determine
the peak storm duration for each frequency.
            2.   Time of concentrations may be determined as described in
either TR-55 or the IDOT Drainage Manual. Lag time if utilized may be assumed
to be equal to 0.6 times the time of concentration.
            3.   The selected curve numbers or other runoff coefficients must
be calibrated to surveys of existing flood frequencies in other local
watersheds which have already been modeled. This information shall be provided
to the city. If the engineer does not have calibrated curve numbers for a
similar watershed, the city will provide curve numbers with such a basis.
      (4)   The detention basin may be designed to drain dry or to retain water
for extended periods after rain events. All detention/retention basins must be
properly maintained and kept free of algae growth, trash and other debris;
      (5)   The depth-area-volume relationship of the basin is dependent on the
storage volume needed to reduce the peak inflow rate to some desired peak
outflow rate. As the natural contours in the site dictate, ponding depths
should be kept as shallow as possible. However, where stormwater storage depths
exceed four feet, a bench width of six feet should be provided around the
entire perimeter of the basin (exclusive of bermed areas). Outlets from
normally dry detention basins can take on a number of forms, limited only by
safety and maintenance considerations. Outlet pipe must be at least 12 inches
in diameter to facilitate maintenance. If less capacity is required than a 12-
inch pipe would provide, flow should be throttled at the pipe entrance. Trash
racks or perforated risers are required at inlets to help guard against
plugging of the pipe;
      (6)   The side slope of the basin should be no steeper than four
horizontal to one vertical (4:1) for the safety of mechanical mowing equipment
and the safety of people during those times when water is being stored. All
grades on the bottom of this basin should be at least 2% so that the bottom
will drain quickly and leave no wet spots. A low flow concrete channel shall be
provided in the basin;
      (7)   An emergency spillway outlet shall be provided for discharge of
flows in the event the storage capacity is exceeded or the primary outlet is
non-functional. The emergency spillway shall be designed for the 100-year storm
frequency event assuming the basin is dry, or at normal pool for a wet basin,
and the primary outlet is non-functional (plugged) at the start of the rainfall
event;
      (8)   Easements should be included if necessary and access roads provided
to allow vehicles and other equipment the access needed for maintenance of the
basin;
      (9)   If detention is to be of the wet basin, (retention type), the
volume needed for temporary storage must be provided above the normal pond
elevation;
      (10)   The outlet structure of wet basins (retention type) must be
constructed such that the pond level is maintained. The side slopes beneath the
water surface of the pond should be two horizontal to one vertical (2:1), to a
depth of three or four feet to discourage the growth of aquatic plants unless a
wetland system is developed along the shoreline of the pond. If fish are to be
stocked in the pond, at least 25% of the ponds area should be at least ten feet
deep;
      (11)   An as-built survey of detention basin grades and outlets with an
accompanying storage calculation will be required upon completion of the
proposed detention basin. Any completed basin below 95% of the design storage
shall be regraded and reseeded to obtain the original design storage; and
      (12)   Detention dams which meet the criteria as a regulated dam as
described in the most recent version of “Rules for Construction and Maintenance
of Dams” by the State Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water

SOIL EXCAVATION AND EROSION CONTROL
§ 155.055 FINDINGS.
   (A)   Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain non-agricultural uses, including, but not limited to,
the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants,
the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and
drainageways and the creation of recreational facilities.
   (B)   The washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision
and reducing traction of road vehicles.
   (C)   Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys, washed-out
fills and embankments.
   (D)   Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to
pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs.
   (E)   Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and
other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove.
   (F)   Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage
capacity of floodplains and natural depressions, resulting in increased chances
of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
(Prior Code, § 155.055) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.056 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these requirements is to safeguard persons, protect property,
prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any
development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise
results in the movement of earth on land situated in or around the city. It is
the intention of these requirements that the delivery of sediment from sites
affected by land disturbing activities be limited, as closely as practicable,
to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural
undisturbed state.
(Prior Code, § 155.056) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.057 GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
   (A)   It is the objective of these requirements to control soil erosion and
sedimentation caused by development activities, including clearing, grading,
stripping, excavating and filling of land, in and around the city. Measures
taken to control soil erosion and off-site sediment runoff should be adequate
to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of
ten-year frequency or less. The following principles shall apply to all
development activities within and around the city and to the preparation of the
submissions required herein.
   (B)   “Illinois Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control” (prepared by the Northeastern Illinois Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Steering Committee, in cooperation with area Soil and
Water Conservation Districts and the United States Soil Conservation Service,
and known as the Green Book) are designed to provide protection against
sediment leaving the site during a ten-year storm.
   (C)   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site
so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where
high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided, wherever possible, and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
   (D)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds and wetlands
should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of
watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures.
Floodplain and wetland protection will be included in site development plans, a
minimum 25-foot buffer strip shall be preserved along waterbodies and wetlands.
   (E)   Special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from
any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond
or wetland. Preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas
to erosion and sedimentation.
   (F)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (G)   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions and any other
appropriate sediment or runoff control measures shall be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
from land undergoing development.
   (H)   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and
benefits involved.
   (I)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   (J)   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on-site or
downstream.
   (K)   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional
as soon as practical during development.
   (L)   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land
uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
   (M)   All waste generated as a result of site development activity should be
properly disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by
either wind or water.
   (N)   All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
(Prior Code, § 155.057) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)

shall be reviewed and acted upon according to the following procedures.
      (1)   The Director will review each application for a site development
permit to determine its conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The
Director may also refer any application to the St. Clair or Madison County Soil
and Water Conservation District and/or any other local government or public
agency within whose jurisdiction the site is located for review and comment.
Within 30 days after receiving an application, the Director shall, in writing:
         (a)   Approve the permit application if it is found to be in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, and issue the permit;
         (b)   Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable
conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this
chapter, and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or
         (c)   Disapprove the permit application, indicating the deficiencies
and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission.
      (2)   No site development permit shall be issued for an intended
development site unless:
         (a)   The development, including, but not limited to, subdivisions and
planned unit development, has been approved by the city where applicable;
         (b)   Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the city;
         (c)   The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall

for the portion of the site subject to soil disturbance.
      (3)   Failure of the Director to act on an original or revised
application within 30 days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed
in accordance with the plans as filed unless such time is extended by agreement
between the Director and the applicant. Pending preparation and approval of a
revised plan, development activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance
with conditions established by the Director.
   (E)   Expiration of permit. Every site development permit shall expire and
become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been
commenced within 120 days, or is not completed by a date which shall be
specified in the permit; except that the Director may, if the permittee
presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work
being commenced or completed within the specified time limits, grant a
reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the
expiration date of the permit. The Director may require modification of the
erosion control plan to prevent any increase in erosion or off-site sediment
runoff resulting from any extension.
(Prior Code, § 155.058) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.059 DESIGN AND OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Applicability. All clearing, grading, stripping, excavating and
filling which is subject to the permit requirements of this chapter shall be
subject to the applicable standards and requirements set forth in this section.
Development which is exempted from the permit requirements of this chapter are
still required to take actions to control erosion and sedimentation leaving
that development site, and that those actions shall be generally consistent
with this section.
   (B)   Responsibility. The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility
for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, and the city or its
officers or agents will not be made liable for such damage, by:
      (1)   The issuance of a permit under this chapter;
      (2)   Compliance with the provisions of that permit or with conditions
attached to it by the Director;
      (3)   Failure of city officials to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions;
      (4)   Failure of city officials to recommend denial of or to deny a
permit; or
      (5)   Exemptions from the permit requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Site design requirements.
      (1)   On-site sediment control measures, as specified by the following
criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing,
grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site.
         (a)   For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers
(including filter fences, straw bales or equivalent control measures) shall be
constructed to control all off-site runoff as specified in referenced
handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of 25 feet, may be
used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected.
         (b)   For disturbed areas draining more than one, but less than five,
acres, a sediment trap or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at
the downslope point of the disturbed area.
         (c)   For disturbed areas draining more than five acres, a sediment
basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point
of the disturbed area.
         (d)   Sediment basins and sediment traps designs shall provide for
both detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be
composed of equal volumes of “wet” detention storage and “dry” detention
storage and each shall be sized for the two-year, 24-hour runoff from the site
under maximum runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the
basin shall be that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at
least ten hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such
that it only drains the dry detention storage.
         (e)   The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated
sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction
period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in
one year. For construction periods exceeding one year, the one-year sediment
load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted.
      (2)   (a)   Stormwater conveyance channels, including ditches, swales and
diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the ten-year frequency
storm without erosion.
         (b)   All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized within
48 hours, consistent with the following standards:

      (3)   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent
measures within seven calendar days following the end of active disturbance or
redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria.
         (a)   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding and/or non-vegetative measures.
         (b)   Areas having slopes greater than 20% shall be stabilized with
sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or equivalent.
      (4)   Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided,
where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following
requirements shall be met.
         (a)   Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to
the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary,
temporary crossings shall be constructed of non-erosive material, such as
riprap or gravel.
         (b)   The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be
kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be
restabilized within 48 hours after channel disturbance is completed,
interrupted or stopped.
         (c)   Channel relocation should be avoided, whenever possible.
Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be constructed
in the dry and fully stabilized before flow is diverted.
      (5)   Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment
traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and specifications,
but implemented in a manner which will avoid unacceptable flooding of pubic
streets.
      (6)   Soil storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material
shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a
roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter
fence or equivalent, shall be installed immediately on the downslope side of
the piles.
      (7)   If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be
protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through
appropriately designed sediment traps or basins or equivalent.
      (8)   Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads,
access drives and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent
sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment
reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street
cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a
controlled sediment disposal area.
      (9)   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices
must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance.
      (10)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
disposed of within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved with
permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
   (D)   Maintenance of control measures.
      (1)   All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet
the requirements of this chapter shall be maintained periodically by the
applicant or subsequent land owner during the period of land disturbance and
development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate
performance.
      (2)   Effective maintenance of control measures is critical to their
success and shall be budgeted into the erosion and sediment control plan.
      (3)   Particular emphasis shall be placed on the following types of
maintenance needs: repair and replacement of sediment barriers, such as straw
bales; removal of excess accumulated sediment from traps, basins and channels;
irrigation, fertilization or reseeding of vegetatively stabilized areas; repair
of scour or gully development on slopes and in channels; removal of sediment
from roadways; and control of dust.
   (E)   Inspection.
      (1)   (a)   The Director, City Engineer or their designees shall make
inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of
the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to
comply with the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan as
approved. Plans for grading, stripping, excavating and filling work bearing the
stamp of approval of the Director shall be maintained at the site during
progress of the work.
         (b)   In order to obtain inspections and to ensure compliance with the
approved erosion and sediment control plan, the site development or building
permit and this chapter, the permittee shall notify the Director within two
working days of the completion of the construction stages specified below:
            1.   Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control
measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding
with any other earth disturbance or grading;
            2.   After stripping and clearing;
            3.   After rough grading;
            4.   After final grading;
            5.   After seeding and landscaping deadlines; and
            6.   After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of
sediment controls.
      (2)   (a)   If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be
done in phases or areas, the permittee shall give notice and request inspection
at the completion of each of the above work stages in each phase or area.
         (b)   If an inspection is not made and notification of the results
given within five working days after notice is received by the city from the
permittee, the permittee may continue work at his or her own risk, without
presuming acceptance by the city.
         (c)   Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in
writing at the site.
   (F)   Special precautions.
      (1)   (a)   If, at any stage of the grading of any development site, the
Director determines, by inspection, that the nature of the site is such that
further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any
property, public way, stream, lake, wetland or drainage structure, the Director
or City Engineer may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done,
that such reasonable special precautions to be taken as is considered advisable
to avoid the likelihood of such peril.
         (b)   SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS may include, but shall not be limited to, a
more level exposed slope; construction of additional drainage facilities;
berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing; installation of plant materials for
erosion control; and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or
engineering geologist which may be made requirements for further work.
      (2)   (a)   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the
grading on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the
permittee required to install temporary structures or take such other measures
as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety.
         (b)   On large developments or where unusual site conditions prevail,
the Director may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion or
may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure
completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal
rains.
   (G)   Amendment of plans.
      (1)   Major amendments of the site development or erosion and
sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the Director or City Engineer
and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the
original plans.
      (2)   Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the
Director by written authorization to the permittee.
(Prior Code, § 155.059) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
SUBDIVISION STREET TREE PLANTING REQUIREMENTS
§ 155.070 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   All subdivisions and developments shall submit a tree planting plan, unless
excepted by the City Council, that:
   (A)   Supports functional purposes on the site, such as creation of privacy,
drainage, visual screening, spatial definition and the like;
   (B)   Enhances the appearance of the development and neighborhood;
   (C)   Enhances the driving environment;
   (D)   Enhances the pedestrian environment;
   (E)   Identifies all landscape areas;
   (F)   Identifies landscaping elements within landscaped areas; and
   (G)   Meets or exceeds the standards of this program.
(Prior Code, § 155.070) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.071 TREE PLANTING STANDARDS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   (a)   All developments shall establish belts or groves of trees
along all city streets, unless otherwise provided by the City Council.
         (b)   These standards are minimums and are not intended to limit
additional tree plantings as may be approved by the City Engineer.
         (c)   All street tree plantings will be designed and installed
according to the following guidelines.
         (d)   Where the immediate planting of required trees in the right-of-
way may not be in the best interest of the public, the City Council, in lieu of
such street tree planting requirement, may, in the final plat ordinance and at
its discretion:
            1.   Require an escrow of the costs for future planting of such
trees in that subdivision or a fee; or
            2.   Require not less than two trees per lot frontage to be placed
within the lot on private property.
      (2)   The escrow or fee shall be in the amount determined by the city
necessary for the city to purchase and install the number of street trees of a
type on the approved city list equal to two trees for every 50 feet of frontage
within the subject subdivision.
   (B)   Intent and purpose. Tree-lined streets encourage walking, promote
interaction between neighbors, slow vehicle speeds and moderate climatic
effects.

(Prior Code, § 155.071) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.072 LOCATION.
   The intent of this section is to help create a community environment that is
aesthetically pleasing for drivers and pedestrians and promotes a healthy and
thriving green space.
   (A)   Except as where an alternative design is approved, canopy shade trees
will be planted in the parkway between the sidewalk and the street on average
every 50 feet apart on center within the parkway. Note: ordinance requires all
parkways to be designed at seven feet wide.
   (B)   As a general rule, the canopies of large deciduous trees at maturity
should nearly touch.
   (C)   Street trees will not be located (*exception to the above standards
will occur within culs-de-sac, elbows and the like, with approval from the
city) within:
      (1)   Twenty feet of a streetlight;
      (2)   Six feet of a water, sewer or gas line;
      (3)   Ten feet of a fire hydrant, manhole or sewer inlet;
      (4)   Thirty feet of an intersection;
      (5)   An area blocking the view of traffic signs;
      (6)   Ten feet of a driveway; and
      (7)   The valley of a drainage swale.
   (D)   Ornamental trees shall be planted in substitution for the canopy shade
trees where overhead lines and fixtures would interfere with the normal
maturing of canopy trees.
   (E)   Unless otherwise approved, trees shall be placed at the following set
intervals:
 
Type of Tree                             Interval*
Canopy shade trees (50’ or taller)     35’—50’ on center
Coniferous evergreens (for use on berms) 25’—40’ on center (staggering is
                                         permitted)
Ornamental trees                          
   Medium: 35’—50’ tall          
   Small: 25’—35’ tall          25’—35’ on center
Notes to Table:
*Exact locations and spacing may be adjusted at the option of the applicants
with approval from the city.
 
   (F)   The developer shall design a street tree plan which corresponds to the
character of the subdivision. In subdivisions that are grid-like and more
traditional, the developer should plant trees in a formal and consistent
manner, using trees of similar size and shape with regular intervals. In
subdivisions with curvilinear streets, the developer should plant a diversity
of species both in size and shape in informal patterns to mimic randomness in
nature.
   (G)   Smaller or under-story trees may be planted between or among larger
canopy trees to create diversity in scale and to counteract gaps in density
when streetlights, utilities or driveways create voids.
(Prior Code, § 155.072) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.073 SPECIES DIVERSITY.
   (A)   All developments will adhere to the following guidelines to prevent
uniform insect or disease damage to the extensive landscape being installed.
This species diversity standard is set as a minimum only. Extensive
monocultures are prohibited.
   (B)   In general, a single species should not make up more than 20% of the
city’s street tree population.
   (C)   Depending on the number of trees planted in the entire development,
the following maximum percentage of any one species will be used.
 
Number of Trees Maximum % Minimum Number of Species
10—29         50%       2 species
30—59         33%       3 species
60 or more      25%       4 species
 
   (D)   A single species will be placed in no more than four consecutive
locations on any one side of the street.
   (E)   Species will be determined from the approved street tree list found in
Appendix A, attached at the end of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 155.073) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.074 PROCEDURE AND INSTALLATION.
   (A)   The following ensures that the environment desired by the community is
created efficiently.
   (B)   These guidelines will prevent costs to the developer for removal,
replacement or relocation of trees and prevent costs to the homeowner or city
for future maintenance or repair of avoidable damages.
      (1)   Detailed landscape plans shall be submitted with the final plat or
final construction plans. The landscape plan shall be one consolidated sheet
showing the locations of street trees, utilities, manholes, fire hydrants,
light posts and the like. During the plat design process, landscape and utility
plans should be coordinated. Approval will be made during the final plat review
for the location and type of street trees. Note: tree/utility separations shall
not be used as a means of avoiding the planting of required street trees.
      (2)   At the time of final plat or plan approval, the developer is
required to provide a bond or letter of credit (“LOC”) to the city for any and
all street trees installed within the subdivision. The bond or LOC will last
the duration of two years from the date the sidewalks and trees are accepted by
the city.
      (3)   Planting time, in general, is from October to December and March to
May.
      (4)   Immediately prior to planting, the developer will mark all street
tree locations on site, also identifying the species of tree.
      (5)   The city will inspect the locations and species variation on site
to affirm adherence to the approved street tree plan in addition to approving
any alterations or departures from the original tree plan. The city will also
inspect all trees prior to planting to ensure acceptable tree quality and size
according to the “American Standard for Nursery Stock”, published by the
American Association for Nurserymen.
      (6)   Each street tree will be centered in the parkway (e.g., three feet,
six inches from curb in a seven-foot parkway), unless the parkway is used as a
vegetated drainage swale. If a swale is indicated, the species and location
will be determined by the city.
      (7)   Each tree will be installed with a root barrier to prevent
excessive root growth into neighboring utilities or roadways/sidewalks. The
following diagrams are two models of acceptable root barrier methods. Examples
are taken from www.DeepRoot.com.
Surround Root Barrier

      (8)   Trunk protectors will be installed around the trunk flares or bases
of all trees to avoid damage from weed eaters, lawnmowers and the like.
      (9)   Trees will be planted with the following minimum sizes (measured at
four-foot height):
 
Type of Tree      Minimum Size
Canopy shade tree 2” caliper, balled and burlapped
Evergreen tree    6’ in height, balled and burlapped
Ornamental tree   1.5” caliper, balled and burlapped
 
      (10)   The city will perform a post-planting inspection for proper tree
installation according to American Standard for Nursery Stock.
      (11)   Following tree and sidewalk acceptance by the city, the city will
be responsible for the maintenance of the tree. The homeowner will be
responsible for the area around and beneath the canopy including collection and
disposal of leaves, twigs, branches and other tree litter.
(Prior Code, § 155.074) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.075 PASTORAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Any subdivision which contains lots greater than one acre on average may
have the preceding guidelines and requirements waived by the city. The
developer will then have the option of following these guidelines or creating
an alternative street tree planting scheme as approved by the city. If the
developer of such subdivision does not plant trees in the right-of-way or
within an approved planting scheme, the developer is required to donate the
equivalent number of trees to the city or to pay a cash contribution in lieu of
the tree dedications. The equivalent number of trees shall be determined as two
trees for every 50 feet of frontage within the subdivision. The cash
contribution shall be based on the fair market value of the trees in place as
permitted in the approved street tree list (
Appendix A of this chapter).
(Prior Code, § 155.075) (Ord. 3319, passed 2-22-2005)
§ 155.076 LANDSCAPE BERMS.
   (A)   Required berms. A minimum 30-foot wide natural landscape buffer a
minimum of four feet in height with a maximum slope of three to one (3:1) (to
include a berm that will provide visual protection to the property owner from
the roadway) is required whenever the back or side yards of a residential
development face non-subdivision streets or whenever a landscape berm is
otherwise required on the plat. There shall be no right of access across a
landscape easement. Where fencing is to be constructed along a landscape buffer
and is visible from the public roadway, a permanent ornamental fence of a
height and design that is consistent and that will be harmonious with the
neighborhood and residential character is required in these situations. This
can be achieved through either construction by the developer or required in the
covenants of the subdivision and deed restricted against the applicable lots.
No fence or structure shall be constructed within the landscape buffer without
express written authorization of the city.
   (B)   Buffers. Areas consisting of berms, evergreens and other landscaping
which act as a buffer between the development and major thoroughfares shall be
laced in a landscaping easement that will be maintained by the adjacent
property owner, or on outlots to be maintained by a homeowner association.
Berms shall not be placed over utilities. Fences will not be allowed in
landscape easements.
   (C)   Berms. Required landscape berms shall be placed in common ground for
permanent maintenance, or if otherwise approved by the Council, may be part of
any lot, the buffer shall be subject to a permanent maintenance easement
acceptable to the city and shall not be counted in the calculation of minimum
lot size required by the applicable zoning. Such easements shall be deed
restricted to prevent adjacent property owners from constructing any facilities
or structures (including fences) on a berm or easement.

§ 156.03 PLANNED USE APPROVAL.
   No person, firm or corporation shall alter an existing mobile home park, or

(Prior Code, § 156.03) (Ord. 3563, passed 3-3-2008) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.04 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   (A)   Upon planned use rezoning approval and receipt of an application for a
permit to construct a new mobile home park or an application for a permit to
alter a licensed mobile home park, the city shall, if the park is, or the
proposed park will be, in conformity with this chapter and the rules and
regulations adopted by the city pursuant thereto, issue a permit to construct,
a permit to alter or an original license, as the case may be. If the
application for a permit to construct, a permit to alter or an original license
is declined, the city shall give the reasons therefor in writing to the
applicant; and if the objections can be corrected, the applicant may amend his
or her application and resubmit it for approval.
   (B)   If a permit to construct or a permit to alter a park has been issued,
the applicant, upon completion thereof, shall notify the city. The city shall
then inspect the park and, if completed in accordance with the approved plans,
shall issue a license for the number of approved sites after receipt of the
required fee.
(Prior Code, § 156.04) (Ord. 3563, passed 3-3-2008)
§ 156.05 LICENSE.
   (A)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish, maintain, conduct or
operate a mobile home park after the effective date of the city ordinance
adopting this chapter, without first obtaining and maintaining a valid license
therefor from the city. CONDUCT OR OPERATE A MOBILE HOME PARK, as used in this
chapter, shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, supplying or
maintaining common water, sewer or other utility supply or service, or the
collection of rents, directly or indirectly, from two or more independent
mobile homes. Such license shall expire April 30 of each year and a new license
shall be issued upon proper application and payment of the annual license fee;
provided the applicant is in compliance with this chapter. The annual license
fee shall be in an amount as established by the city.
   (B)   Annual license fees submitted after April 30 shall be subject to a
late fee as established by the city. The licensee shall also complete and
return a license renewal application by March 31 of each year.

permit to alter the park as provided in this chapter. Payment of the additional
fee for the additional mobile home sites shall be paid and the amended license
therefor obtained before any mobile homes are accommodated on the additional
mobile home sites. The city shall issue an amended license to cover such
additional mobile home sites, when they are to be occupied before the end of
the license year, for which an annual license has been previously issued.
   (D)   Each license fee shall be paid to the city and any license fee or any
part thereof, once paid to and accepted by the city shall not be refunded.
   (E)   All permits to construct, all licenses to operate and all permits to
make alterations therein shall be prominently displayed in the park office. All
licenses issued under this chapter shall be transferable only with the written
consent of the city; provided, however, that the city may not withhold such
consent where the provisions of this chapter have been met.
(Prior Code, § 156.05) (Ord. 3563, passed 3-3-2008) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.06 STANDARDS.
   Each mobile home park licensed or to be constructed under the provisions of
this chapter shall be operated and maintained in accordance with the
requirements of this section and all other applicable codes and regulations of
the city and the following supplemental regulations.
   (A)   Every mobile home park shall be managed by a responsible individual
whose name, address and telephone number shall be on file, at all times, with
the city and whose duty it shall be to maintain the park, its facilities and
equipment in a clean, orderly and sanitary condition, and shall be responsible,
with the licensee, for any violation of the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   No mobile home park shall be so located that the drainage of the park
area will endanger any water supply. All such parks shall be well drained. No
wastewater shall be deposited on the surface of the ground within the mobile
home park.
   (C)   Each site on which a mobile home is accommodated shall have a minimum
area of 2,500 square feet.
   (D)   Except as noted hereafter, no mobile home shall be parked closer than
five feet to the side lot lines of a park. However, a minimum separation of ten
feet shall be maintained between the mobile home and any other structures
including those structures on adjoining property. No mobile home shall be
situated closer than 25 feet to a public street, alley or building and no
closer than ten feet to a private street or alley. Each individual site shall
abut or face on a private or public street. All streets shall have unobstructed
access to a public street.
   (E)   When a water carriage system of sewage is used, each site shall be
provided with a sewer connection for the combined liquid waste outlet or
outlets of each mobile home. It shall be the duty of the owner or operator of
the park to provide an approved type of water- and odor-tight connection from
the mobile home water drainage to the sewer connection, and it shall be the
duty of the owner or operator to make such connection and keep all occupied
mobile homes, connected to the sewer while located in the park. Sewer
connections in unoccupied sites shall be so closed that they will emit no odors
or cause a breeding place for flies. No water or waste shall be allowed to fall
on the ground from a mobile home.
   (F)   A sufficient number of adequate fly-proof and water-tight containers
in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the city shall be supplied
for the storage of garbage.
   (G)   Garbage containers shall be emptied at least once a week and shall not
be filled to overflowing, or allowed to become foul smelling or a breeding
place for flies. Garbage and rubbish shall be disposed of in a manner which
creates neither a nuisance, nor a menace to health and which is approved by the
city.
   (H)   Adequate insect and rodent control measures shall be employed. All
buildings shall be fly- and rodent-proof, and rodent harborages shall not be
permitted to exist in the park or pathways.
   (I)   All streets in every park must be maintained in a passable and
reasonably dust-proof condition at all times.
   (J)   The management and owner of every park shall assume full
responsibility for maintaining in good repair and condition all sanitary,
electrical and safety appliances in the park, and shall promptly bring such
action as is necessary to prosecute or eject from the park any person or
persons who willfully or maliciously damage such appliances, or any person or
persons who fail to comply with the regulations of this chapter.
   (K)   Electrical outlets for each individual site shall be provided and the
installation shall be in accordance with all state or local codes and
ordinances.
   (L)   In no event shall a non-permanent shelter or other vehicle designed or
used for sleeping purposes, other than a mobile home, be permitted for
occupancy at any time in a mobile home park.
   (M)   When community kitchens, dining rooms, laundries or other facilities
are provided, such facilities and equipment as are supplied must be maintained
in a sanitary condition and kept in good repair, and subject to such rules and
regulations as may be issued by the city.
   (N)   In all buildings constructed or altered, all plumbing and all
electrical and heating installations shall be in accordance with existing city
ordinances and codes and the applicable codes and regulation of the state.
   (O)   The city shall keep a record of all mobile home parks, those records
to show the names and addresses of all parks, names and addresses of the
licensees, number of mobile home lots in each park, source of sewage and
garbage disposal and any other information desired by the city.
   (P)   A register shall be maintained by the manager of each mobile home
park. Such register shall include the name and address of the owner of each
mobile home and every occupant of such mobile home and the square feet of floor
space contained in such mobile home and the date of entry of such mobile home
into the park. The register shall be signed by the owner or occupant of the
mobile home. Any person furnishing misinformation for purposes of registration
shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. The registration records shall be
neatly and securely maintained, and no registration records shall be destroyed
until one year following change in ownership of a mobile home or the
termination of a lease of a mobile home or eviction of the mobile home or
tenant from the park. The register shall be available for inspection upon
request by all law enforcement officers and by the city.
   (Q)   Mobile home parks shall comply with such additional requirements as
set forth in 210 ILCS 115, the Mobile Home Park Act and any state regulations
enacted pursuant thereto except where inconsistent with the requirements
herein.
   (R)   The Code Official shall be authorized to adopt such interpretations,
regulations or orders as may be necessary to enforce and apply the provisions
and intent of this section.
(Prior Code, § 156.06) (Ord. 3563, passed 3-3-2008) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.07 INSPECTION.
   (A)   The city shall inspect at least once each year, each mobile home park
and all the accommodations and facilities therewith. Such officials or officers
are hereby granted the power and authority to enter upon the premises of such
parks at any time for the purposes herein set forth.
   (B)   The city may issue rules and regulations to carry out the provisions
of this chapter. Such rules may contain provisions for the city to grant a
waiver to a mobile home park, if the intent and purpose of this chapter are
met.
(Prior Code, § 156.07) (Ord. 3563, passed 3-3-2008) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.08 SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE.
   (A)   Any license granted hereunder shall be subject to revocation or
suspension by the city. However, the city shall first serve or cause to be
served upon the licensee a written notice in which shall be specified the way
or ways in which such licensee has failed to comply with this chapter, or any
rules or regulations promulgated by the city pertaining thereto. The notice
shall require the licensee to remove or abate such nuisance, unsanitary or
objectionable condition, specified in such notice, within five days or within a
longer period of time as may be allowed by the city. If the licensee fails to
comply with the terms and conditions of the notice, within the time specified
or such extended period of time, the city may revoke or suspend such license.
   (B)   A mobile home park whose license has been voided, suspended, denied or
revoked may be re-licensed by submission of an application to the city.
Approval shall be issued if an inspection of the park, by the city, reveals
compliance with this chapter and the rules promulgated pursuant to this
chapter.
(Prior Code, § 156.08) (Ord. 3563, passed 3-3-2008) Penalty, see §
156.99
§ 156.09 APPEAL AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   Any person whose application for a license is denied or whose license is
suspended or revoked shall have the right to appeal the decision to the hearing
officer and judicial review in the same manner as an appeal, pursuant to §§
157.295 through
157.301. Any person who fails to file such an appeal within the time frames and
requirements set forth therein shall to the full extent permitted by law be
barred from obtaining judicial review of such administrative decision for
failure to exhaust applicable remedies.
(Prior Code, § 156.09) (Ord. 3563, passed 3-3-2008)
§ 156.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter or
shall fail to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant to any section of
this chapter, upon conviction therefor, shall be punished in accordance with
the general penalty for violation of ordinances of the city.

of notice by the city shall constitute a separate offense.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall limit any other remedy that the city may have by
law.
   (D)   Any failure to operate a mobile home park without a valid license
shall also preclude any claim of continued lawful non-conforming status as may
otherwise exist, pursuant to §§
157.075 through
157.084.

SITE PLANS
§ 157.050 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The intent of site plan approval is to further the purposes of these
regulations by ensuring that redevelopment and new development are designed in
a manner that reasonably protects the public welfare and which conforms to the
applicable general requirements and any supplemental conditions established by
a planned or special use approval.
(Prior Code, § 158.050) (Ord. 3463, passed 7-17-2006)
§ 157.051 TYPES OF SITE PLANS; WHEN REQUIRED.
   The term SITE PLAN shall include the following required plans.
   (A)   Preliminary site plan (concept plan). A preliminary site plan is a
development plan showing uses and structures proposed for a parcel or parcels
of land as required by §
157.053. The preliminary site plan is required to depict conceptual development
plans for purposes of approval of a planned or special use.
   (B)   Final site plan (improvement plans). A final site plan is required to
approve the final site requirements as set forth in §
157.054. Final site plan approval is required prior to the following
activities:
      (1)   The grading of any site for development or the issuance of any
building permit for any new principal structure, including building and/or
parking lot expansion, regardless of type of use;
      (2)   A change in the type of occupancy of a property as defined in the
city’s adopted Building Codes and that would also require a building permit; or
      (3)   Any other change in any principal or accessory use of a property as
determined by the Director.
   (C)   Sketch site plan (one- and two-family plot plan).
      (1)   A sketch site plan is required in lieu of a preliminary site plan
and final site plan for the construction or improvements of a single-family
detached structure, single-family attached villa or a duplex. At a minimum, a
sketch plan shall depict all proposed improvements to the site, limits of the
parcel, building setbacks, easements, finished floor elevations, all existing
uses located on the site and other such information as may be needed to verify
compliance with all other laws and regulations of the city.
      (2)   Sketch plans shall be approved administratively in the manner
provided for site plans for permitted uses. No building permit shall be
effective until a required sketch plan has been approved.
(Prior Code, § 158.051) (Ord. 3463, passed 7-17-2006)
§ 157.052 SITE PLAN EXCEPTIONS.
   The Director may waive the requirement that a site plan be submitted when
the applicant demonstrates to the Director one of the following.
   (A)   The proposed development, issuance of a certificate of occupancy or
change in the principal use of property will have no detrimental impact on
adjoining property and would otherwise clearly comply with all regulations of
the city without review of the plan, thereby eliminating the necessity for the
establishment of or revision to a site plan.
   (B)   The proposed development will conform in every material respect to a
site plan previously approved for the same property.
   (C)   Valid and complete subdivision improvement plans already have been
approved by the city for the development as proposed.

   (C)   Consideration of final site plans.
      (1)   No changes. A final site plan that contains no changes or additions
to the approved preliminary site plan shall be approved by the Director upon a
determination that all conditions of approval of the preliminary site plan, if
any, have been satisfied by the applicant, and that all other submission
requirements have been satisfied.
      (2)   Minor changes. A final site plan that contains minor changes to the

         (e)   Changes of any peripheral setback of up to 5%;
         (f)   Decrease of areas devoted to open space of up to 5%; and
         (g)   Minor changes in the landscape plan; except that total landscape
area cannot be decreased.
      (3)   Substantial changes. A final site plan that contains any changes
that are not “minor changes” shall be considered substantial changes from the
approved preliminary site plan and may be approved only by the City Council.
The City Council shall apply the criteria set forth herein, applicable to a
preliminary site plan application.
      (4)   Conditions on approval. If the City Council attaches conditions to
the approval of a final site plan, it shall designate specific requirements, if
any, that must be met before issuance of a grading permit or building permit.
The City Council may delegate to the Director the authority to determine
whether the specifically prescribed conditions attached to the approval have
been satisfied by the applicant. Such conditions may arise from a change in
circumstances following the original approval, identification of new
information or other reasonable factors warranting conditions as necessary to
satisfy the approval criteria.
   (D)   Duration of validity (final site plan). Final site plan approval
shall, unless a shorter time is specified, be valid for a period of 12 months
from the date of such approval, unless within such period a building permit is
obtained and substantial construction is commenced and all additional building
permits necessary to complete the project as approved in the final site plan
schedule are obtained in a timely fashion, as determined by the Building
Official. An application for extension of a final site plan may be granted, if
the application is filed before the final site plan expires. Upon granting an
extension, the City Council has the authority to attach new conditions to the
final site plan as it deems appropriate. SUBSTANTIAL CONSTRUCTION, as used in
this section, shall mean completion of at least 10% of the construction in
terms of the total expected cost of the project for which the permit was
issued. Whenever a final site plan or phase thereof has expired as provided in
this section, no development shall take place on the property until a new final
site plan has been submitted and approved. A new final site plan shall be
required for any construction not completed within five years of the date of
the final site plan approval.
   (E)   Recording of final site plans for planned and special uses. Following
the approval of a final site plan for any PUD or special use, a copy of the
site plan signed by the Mayor and City Clerk shall be filed by the applicant
with the County Recorder of Deeds. All filing fees shall be paid by the person
who filed the site plan application. The authorization for the use approved by
the site plan shall not become effective until a copy of the recorded plan
bearing its recordation notations shall be returned and placed on file with the
City Clerk. Unless waived by the Director, the final site plan shall be
combined with the final plat where easements or infrastructure are to be
dedicated to the public or the final site plan includes the subdivision of
land. Such waiver may be granted where the dedication and transfer of
easements, improvements or land can be lawfully satisfied pursuant to this code
without recording of a final plat.
(Prior Code, § 158.054) (Ord. 3463, passed 7-17-2006)
§ 157.055 GENERAL SITE PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   The required general site plan review procedures are as follows.
   (A)   Permitted use. The Director has the authority to administratively
approve a preliminary, final or sketch site plan for a permitted use in any
district. A petitioner requesting site plan approval for a permitted use may
file a final site plan without providing application of a preliminary site
plan.
   (B)   Special use. An application for a special use must comply with both
the preliminary and final site plan application contents and submittal
requirements and procedures and the requirements in §§
157.095 through
157.102 for specials uses. A preliminary site plan for a special use shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for approval, conditional approval or
denial as part of the special use application, with the City Council having the
authority to exercise its right of review within 21 days of the Planning
Commission’s decision to approve, approve with conditions or deny a site plan
for a special use as provided in §§
157.095 through
157.102. The final site plan for a special use may be approved under the
administrative process for permitted uses.
   (C)   Planned use. An application for a planned use must comply with both
the preliminary and final site plan application contents and submittal
requirements and procedures as well as the requirements outlined in §§
157.115 through
157.121 for planned uses. The approval of a planned use is a legislative act of
rezoning, therefore, the review and approval of a preliminary site plan for a
planned use must be conducted in accord with all rezoning requirements,
including the requirements of §§
157.255 through
157.257. The preliminary site plan shall be incorporated in and subject to the
ordinance approving any planned use as provided for in §§
157.115 through
157.121, or as otherwise provided in this code. The final site plan for a
planned use may be approved under the administrative process for permitted
uses.
   (D)   Reports required for planned and special uses. The Community
Development Department shall prepare a project report for special and planned
uses that provides a review of the preliminary site plan in light of the
comprehensive plan, the applicable review criteria set forth herein, the
requirements of this chapter and the input of appropriate city departments. The
Director shall forward a copy of the report to the applicant. The Director
shall forward any completed application for a site plan for a special and
planned use to the Planning Commission and/or City Council for further review
and consideration.
   (E)   General site plan review criteria. In reviewing a site plan
application, the Director shall identify and evaluate all factors relevant to
the application, including whether it complies with all applicable provisions
of this chapter. Generally, the following criteria are used to evaluate both
the preliminary site plan and final site plan:
      (1)   Conformance with the requirements of the applicable zoning
ordinances and this code, and all other applicable codes and policies of the
city;
      (2)   Circulation in terms of an internal street circulation system
designed for the type of traffic generated, safety, separation from living
areas, convenience, access, handicap access, noise and exhaust control. Though
generally discouraged, private internal streets may be considered where
appropriate to the development. A proper institutional framework must be
established for maintenance thereof and the streets must be accessible by
Police and Fire Department vehicles for emergency purposes. Bicycle and
pedestrian traffic shall be considered and provided for when necessary;
      (3)   Functional open space in terms of recreation, views, density
relief, convenience, function and optimum preservation of natural features,
including trees and drainage areas;
      (4)   The adequacy, safety, separation, convenience, access to points of
destination and attractiveness of pedestrian ways;
      (5)   Building type in terms of appropriateness to density, site
relationship and bulk and building design in terms of orientation, spacing,
materials, exterior color and texture, storage and lighting are appropriate for
the development;
      (6)   Landscaping of total site as shown by amount, types and materials
used, maintenance, suitability and effect on the neighborhood;
      (7)   The site plan has been shown to fit within the context of the
planned land use pattern and roadway and utility systems of the larger
surrounding sub-area;
      (8)   Consistency with the city’s adopted 2040 Master Plan on file with
the City Clerk, and any adopted design guidelines applicable to the site, and
any adopted sub-area master plan;
      (9)   City water and sewer systems can adequately serve the proposed
development; and
      (10)   Stormwater runoff is not increased at the boundaries of the
property or can adequately be handled by an off-site stormwater system.
   (F)   Denial of site plan criteria. The applicant shall have the burden of
demonstrating that the site plan application meets the applicable review
criteria. The city shall not approve a site plan application unless the city
determines that the proposed use or development:
      (1)   When completed pursuant to the proposed site plan, would be
consistent with all applicable requirements of this chapter or applicable
zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance or other applicable municipal codes and
policies;
      (2)   Would not adversely affect the safety and convenience of vehicular
and pedestrian circulation in the vicinity of the subject property, including
traffic reasonably expected to be generated by the proposed use and other uses
in the area;
      (3)   Is compatible with existing or permitted uses on adjacent sites, in
terms of building height, setbacks and open spaces, bulk and scale,
landscaping, exterior building design features, drainage, access, parking and
circulation features; or
      (4)   Will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare or
materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity for reasons
specifically articulated by the Director.
   (G)   Appeals. Appeals of any determination made by the Community
Development Director or other city official pursuant to this subchapter may be
taken by filing an appeal with the zoning hearing officer consistent with the
procedures and regulations identified in §§
157.295 through
157.301.
(Prior Code, § 158.055) (Ord. 3463, passed 7-17-2006; Ord. 3665, passed 5-3-
2010)
§ 157.056 SITE PLAN DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   The following guidelines, principles and standards should be followed and
respected when designing the site.
   (A)   Site design.
      (1)   The site design must respect and enhance the physical and natural
qualities of the site and retain the positive qualities of the existing
environment. It should utilize existing topographic features and improvements,
where feasible, and shall be so located as to complement and conform to the
site topography rather than changing the site to accommodate a preconceived
site design.
      (2)   Areas which shall be visually deemphasized in design of the site
are utilitarian areas such as HVAC equipment, loading docks, storage areas,
service vehicles and trash enclosures. These areas should be located away from
high exposure areas of the building and site (i.e., along street frontages or
other highly visible portions of the site). When such utilitarian areas are
visible from adjacent property or public right-of-way, screening shall be
provided in accordance with §§
157.180 through
157.194, or as otherwise provided in this code. All HVAC equipment shall be
screened from view of any public right-of-way. Enclosures and screening
structures shall be similar in design, color and/or building materials to the
principal building on site.
      (3)   All fences for the purpose of required screening or buffering shall
be of a durable, maintenance free material such as vinyl or masonry. Chain link
is not permitted for any required screening or buffering. Gates for enclosures
may be allowed the option of chain link if constructed with a vinyl coating and
vision slats.
      (4)   The creative use of landscaping, signage, berming and lighting is
encouraged within the framework of the overall landscape theme proposed for the
site. Entrances shall be designed to facilitate the flow of traffic into the
development in order to avoid creating congestion on public streets.
      (5)   All proposed development and associated public improvements to the
transportation system shall comply with the city’s subdivision regulations and
comprehensive plan’s major street plan relative to roadway classifications and
design standards.
      (6)   The proposed building must demonstrate conformity with design
guidelines applicable to the site as part of the comprehensive plan,
requirements set forth in this chapter or any other design guidelines adopted
by the city, including the 2040 Master Plan on file with the City Clerk.
   (B)   Site drainage and stormwater management. Stormwater management and
drainage design shall comply with federal, state and city regulations and
conform to all city specifications relating thereto.
   (C)   Grading/erosion control. Grading and erosion control shall comply with
federal, state and city regulations and conform to all city specifications
relating thereto.
   (D)   Traffic management. All development shall comply with the city’s and/
or Department of Transportation’s access management standards. The city shall
have the authority to permit the type, number and location of all entrances,
exits and circulation patterns on any development site. The city, at its
discretion, may request documentation as necessary to determine the impact any
future improvements may have on the transportation system located within the
city. There are two general levels of documentation that may be required, which
include the following.
      (1)   Technical assessment letter. An assessment letter, prepared by a
certified engineer, of any future traffic impacts shall be submitted to the
city unless waived by the Director. The letter shall include, but is not
limited to, the total trips generated during both the a.m. and p.m. peak
periods and documentation that adequate stacking, queuing and intersection
spacing is provided.
      (2)   Traffic study. The city may request, at its discretion, a traffic
study when traffic generation shows any level of service of “D” or worse
pursuant to the accepted national traffic standards. The city may request a
traffic study upon review of any development or building application to the
city and upon its determination that a safety or service level traffic concern
reasonably may exist relating to the construction or development to be
permitted, and shall so state in writing to the applicant. All traffic studies
shall be prepared by a certified engineer experienced in said studies. The city
shall determine the executor of the study with the cost for the study to be
paid by the developer. A traffic study should contain the following information
or such other information as may be required by the City Engineer:
         (a)   Capacity analysis of critical intersections affected by the
development-generated traffic. The capacity analysis should be performed for
existing traffic demand, traffic demand after completion of the development and
ultimate projected traffic demand. Base ultimate projected traffic volumes
shall be provided by city staff. Capacity analysis shall be performed according
to the criteria contained in the current edition of the “Highway Capacity
Manual”/FHWA/IDOT;
         (b)   Recommendations for maintaining the existing level of service
for each of the critical intersections; recommendations for projected traffic
demand after the development is completed; and recommendations for ultimate
projected traffic demand. These recommendations may include geometric
improvements, such as additional turn lanes or changes in traffic control and/
or street widening. Level of service shall be defined as in the current edition
of the “Highway Capacity Manual”/IDOT;
         (c)   Review of internal traffic circulation and curb cut locations;
and
         (d)   Percentage of contributory traffic created by the proposed
development upon the total entering traffic at critical intersections.
      (3)   Cost of development. The developer of any property should expect,
as a cost of development, to provide any traffic improvements necessary to
maintain the existing level of service.
   (E)   Site access and circulation.
      (1)   Emergency vehicle access. All developments shall be designed to
facilitate entry of emergency vehicles onto the site.
      (2)   Number and location of access points. All developments shall
utilize the minimum number of access points to public streets necessary to
serve the traffic generated by the proposed use. A traffic study may be
required to determine the number and location of access points for a
development. Cross access with adjacent property and shared entrances and/or
driveways in city approved locations and configurations shall be required
unless such requirement is waived by the City Engineer.
      (3)   Internal circulation. Layout of internal driveways and aisles shall
be designed to reduce the potential for traffic conflict and provide for
maximum visibility, sight distance and safety. All through drives shall be
defined utilizing landscaped median islands, and stop signs shall be placed at
all appropriate intersections of such drives with other through drives or
public streets as determined by the City Engineer. For any driveway in excess
of 30 feet in width, channelization using medians may be required to control
ingress and egress to the site. Bicycle and pedestrian traffic access shall be
adequately provided.
      (4)   Stacking for drive-through. For any drive-in or drive-through
facility, adequate stacking spaces shall be provided to ensure that vehicles
waiting to be served do not interfere with ingress or egress to or from the
site or required parking spaces. All drive-through establishments shall also
comply with the requirements of all applicable drive-in and drive-through
supplemental regulations.
   (F)   Lighting standards. All lighting shall conform to the city’s lighting
standards as set forth in this code. All lighting shall be properly designed to
serve multiple purposes, including illumination, vehicular and pedestrian
safety and security without excessive light or improper light nuisance or light
trespass. Additionally, site lighting shall be subject to the following
requirements.
      (1)   On-site exterior lighting. The height and style of lighting
fixtures shall be compatible with the character of the surrounding area and
type of use for which the fixture is designed. Lights shall not be placed or
directed such that they will cause glare or excessive light spillage on
neighboring sites or adjacent public streets. All lights shall be full-cutoff
fixtures unless otherwise authorized by the Director.
      (2)   Streetlights. It shall be the developer’s responsibility to install
lighting standards in accordance with city standards. If lighting standards
already exist and are below current standards, it shall be the developer’s
responsibility to upgrade said lights to current standards.
   (G)   Landscape requirements. Landscape installation and maintenance shall
conform to the minimum landscape specifications of the city as set forth in
this code.
   (H)   Parking requirements. Parking requirements shall conform to the
minimum parking specifications of the city as set forth in §§
157.135 through
157.146.
   (I)   Agency comments. Approvals shall be required, as appropriate, by the
applicable water, sewer, electric, fire district, school district and
transportation authority confirming adequate capacities, accessibility and
design specifications.
   (J)   Additional conditions and requirements. In reviewing a site plan
application, the city may impose such conditions or requirements as may be
necessary to ensure compliance with the review criteria.

2010)
§ 157.057 ISSUANCE OF PERMITS.
   A grading permit, building permit or certificate of occupancy shall not be
issued for any use or development subject to the site plan requirement of this
chapter until a final site plan has been approved as required by this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.057) (Ord. 3463, passed 7-17-2006)
§ 157.058 IMPROVEMENT GUARANTEE.
   Upon submitting a site plan for review and approval by the city, the
applicant guarantees that all improvements set forth on the site plan shall be
completed within a reasonable time as required by the city. Failure to complete
any improvements set forth in an approved site plan within any required time
period shall be a violation of this chapter. Unless otherwise provided on the
site plan, all site plan improvements shall be installed and all other site
plan requirements met prior to issuance of any temporary or final certificate
of occupancy, unless compliance is otherwise required earlier. In lieu of the
actual construction of all physical improvements prior to authorizing an
occupancy permit, the city may accept cash, cashier’s check, letter of credit
or other like security approved by the city, in the amount that will guarantee
the installation of the required improvements within a period of time to be
specified and approved by the city. Such surety shall be properly executed
prior to any occupancy and shall be released in segments upon written approval
of the city. Written authorization to enter the property or fulfill the
obligation of said surety shall be given to the city by the owner as a
condition of any certificate of occupancy permit and of any improvement
guarantee. In determining the amount of said surety, a bona fide estimate or
contract provided by the applicant for improvements shall be submitted to the
city for approval.
(Prior Code, § 158.058) (Ord. 3463, passed 7-17-2006)
§ 157.059 SITE PLAN AMENDMENTS.
   A site plan may be amended by the applicant in the same manner as is
required for initial approval. Any revised site plan drawings must be submitted
to and approved by the Director prior to issuance of a building or grading
permit.
(Prior Code, § 158.059) (Ord. 3463, passed 7-17-2006)
§ 157.060 COMPLIANCE WITH SITE PLANS REQUIRED.
   A site plan approved for a property establishes binding requirements for the
use and development of the property on all persons on and after the date of its
approval, irrespective of any change of ownership or tenancy or change in the
use or structures on the property since its approval. No owner of a property,
or person in control of a property, shall cause or permit the property to be in
non-compliance with a site plan and shall be responsible, at all times, to
ensure that the property is maintained in full compliance with any such
approved site plan, including, but not limited to, maintenance and retention of
the landscaping and other improvements shown on the plan.
(Prior Code, § 158.060) (Ord. 3463, passed 7-17-2006)
NON-CONFORMITIES AND VESTED RIGHTS
§ 157.075 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS CHAPTER. For purposes of determining the existence of
non-conformity, the EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS CHAPTER shall be the effective date
of the ordinance incorporated in this chapter or amendment creating the non-
conformity.
   NON-CONFORMING LOT. A lot lawfully existing on the effective date of this
chapter (and not created for purposes of evading the restrictions of this
chapter) that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the zoning district
in which the lot is located.
   NON-CONFORMING PROJECT. Any lawful structure, development or undertaking
that is incomplete on the effective date of this chapter and would be
inconsistent with one or more of the regulations applicable to the zoning
district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned.
   NON-CONFORMING SIGN. A sign lawfully existing on the effective date of this
chapter that does not conform to one or more of the regulations set forth in
this subchapter.
   NON-CONFORMING SITE IMPROVEMENT. An improvement required on a property by
this chapter and which, on the effective date of this chapter, lawfully is
absent on the property or lawfully does not fully comply with this chapter,
including, but not limited to, parking areas, storm drainage facilities,
sidewalks and landscaping.
   NON-CONFORMING USE. A primary use of or structure on a property lawfully
existing on the effective date of this chapter which is, in any manner, made
unlawful by the regulations in this subchapter or any development, design or
performance standards applicable to the zoning district in which the property
is located. NON-CONFORMING USES shall not include ancillary uses that are not
the primary use of the property or structure.
   NON-CONFORMITY. A non-conforming lot, project, sign, site improvement or use
as defined in this subchapter, or other condition lawfully existing on a
property on the effective date of this chapter that does not fully comply with
the requirements of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.075) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.076 CONTINUATION OF NON-CONFORMITIES.
   Unless otherwise specifically provided in this subchapter and subject to the
restrictions and qualifications set forth herein, non-conformities that were
lawful on the effective date of this chapter may be continued. However, it is
the intent of this subchapter that non-conformities are not to be expanded, and
they should be abolished or reduced to conformity as quickly as the fair
interest to the parties will permit. Non-conformities made unlawful by
generally applicable public health, safety or welfare ordinances of the city,
enacted in whole or in part pursuant to authority other than the city’s zoning
authority, shall not be governed by this section and shall have no right of
being continued unless otherwise provided by law.
(Prior Code, § 158.076) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.077 EXTENSION OR ENLARGEMENT OF NON-CONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Prohibition on enlargement of non- conformity. Except as specifically
provided in this section, no person may engage in an activity that causes or
facilitates an increase in the extent or scope of a non-conformity, including,
but not limited to, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new
structures on open land if such activity results in:
      (1)   An increase in the total amount of space or building area devoted
to a non-conforming use; or
      (2)   A greater non-conformity with respect to dimensional restrictions,
such as setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements or
other requirements, such as parking requirements.
   (B)   Prohibition on expansion of area of non-conformity. Except as
otherwise provided in this section, a non-conformity may not be expanded to
cover more land than was occupied by that non-conformity when it became non-
conforming, or such reduced area to which the non-conformity may have been
lawfully converted as provided herein.
   (C)   Prohibition on increase of intensity of non-conformity. The volume,
intensity or frequency of use of the property, where a non-conformity exists,
may not be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a
non-conformity exists may not be changed if these or similar changes cause an
increase in the degree of activity.
(Prior Code, § 158.077) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.078 REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Minor repairs. Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of structures
and property, where non-conformities exist, are permitted. Work estimated to
cost more than 10% of the structural value of the structure to be renovated
shall be prohibited unless authorized by a special use permit for alteration of
the non-conformity pursuant to §
157.084.
   (B)   Repair of unintended damage. If a structure located on a lot where a
non-conformity exists is damaged by fire, explosion, an act of God or the
public enemy, to an extent that the costs of repair or restoration would not
exceed 50% of its structural value, then the damaged structure may be repaired
or restored only in accordance with a written zoning authorization permit by
the Director.
   (C)   Authorization required. Any repairs, renovation or restoration of a
structure pursuant to divisions (A) and (B) above which requires the issuance
of any permit under the city’s building codes, subdivision and development
control ordinance or site plan approval process shall also require the prior
issuance of a zoning authorization permit by the Director authorizing the
repair or alteration. In support of the application for the permit, the
applicant shall submit sufficient information as may be required to satisfy the
Director that the cost of the proposed repairs, renovation or restoration will
not exceed 50% of the value of the structure prior to the repair, renovation or
restoration.
(Prior Code, § 158.078) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.079 CHANGE OF NON-CONFORMING USE.
   (A)   Prohibition on change of use. A change in use of property where a non-
conformity exists may not be made, except in accordance with this section.
   (B)   Change to permitted use. If the intended change in the non-conforming
use is to a use that is a permitted use or a use subject to conditions in the
zoning district in which the property is located, and all of the other
requirements of this chapter applicable to that use can be complied with,
permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission
to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this chapter is
achieved, the non-conformity status is terminated.
   (C)   Change to permitted use where all chapter requirements not satisfied.
If the intended change in the non-conforming use is to a permitted use or
conditionally permitted use in the district where the property is located, but
all of the requirements of this chapter applicable to that use cannot
reasonably be complied with, then the change is allowed only if the Commission
issues a special use permit for alteration of the non-conformity authorizing
the change pursuant to §
157.084.
(Prior Code, § 158.079) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.080 ABANDONMENT, DISCONTINUANCE OR REDUCTION OF NON-CONFORMITY.
   (A)   Effect of non-conforming use discontinuation. When a non-conforming
use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or discontinued for
any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the non-conforming
use, the property involved may thereafter only be used for conforming uses.
   (B)   Effect of violation of this subchapter. A prohibited expansion of a
non-conformity or other violation of the legal requirements of this subchapter
shall constitute and abandonment of the right to continue the non-conformity.
   (C)   Effect of non-conformity discontinuance. If the primary use on
property where a non-conformity, other than a non-conforming use, exists is
discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or discontinued for any
period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then the
property may thereafter be used only in conformity with any of the regulations
applicable to the preexisting use unless the Commission issues a special use
permit for alteration of the non-conformity pursuant to §
157.084 to allow the property to be again used for this primary purpose without
remedying the non-conforming situations.
   (D)   Effect of reducing intensity, scope or area of non-conformity. If a
non-conformity is lawfully reduced in scope, area or intensity, but not
discontinued or abandoned, no right shall exist to thereafter restore the
original scope, area or intensity of the non-conformity.
   (E)   Determination for property as a whole. For purposes of determining
whether a right to continue a non-conforming situation is lost pursuant to this
section, all of the structures, activities and operations maintained on a lot
are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one
apartment in a non-conforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result
in a loss of the right to rent the apartment or space thereafter so long as the
apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a non-
conforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use,
discontinuance of a non-conforming use for the required period shall terminate
the right to maintain it thereafter.
(Prior Code, § 158.080) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.081 NON-CONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   Compliance with this chapter. Non- conforming signs shall also be
subject to the additional regulations established in this section.
   (B)   Prohibition on alteration of non-conforming signs. A non-conforming
sign may not be enlarged, moved or replaced, nor may the face appearance be
altered, nor illumination added, except to lawfully bring the sign into
complete conformity with the provisions of this chapter or for maintenance
authorized herein.
   (C)   Maintenance and repair.
      (1)   Subject to the other provisions of this section, non-conforming
signs may be maintained and repaired so long as the cost of such work within
any 12-month period does not exceed 50% of the value (tax value if listed for
tax purposes) of such sign.
      (2)   No such work shall be done without the person proposing to do such
work first submitting such information as may be required to satisfy the
Director that the cost of such work would not exceed 50% of the value of the
sign and receiving an authorization from the Director for such work.
   (D)   Abandonment of non-conforming sign. If a non-conforming sign other
than a billboard is blank or advertises a business, service, commodity,
accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity that has not been
operated, offered or conducted for a continuous period of 12 months, the non-
conforming sign aspect of that shall be deemed abandoned and shall be removed
within 30 days after such abandonment by the sign owner, owner of the property
where the sign is located or other person having control over such sign.
   (E)   Non-conforming billboard. If a non- conforming billboard remains blank
for a continuous period of 12 months, that billboard shall be deemed abandoned
and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be altered to comply with
this and all applicable provisions of §§
157.160 through
157.168 or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign
is located or other person having control over such sign.
   (F)   Definition. For purposes of this section, a sign is BLANK if:
      (1)   It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation,
attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being
offered or conducted;
      (2)   The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or
substantial part;
      (3)   The advertising copy paid for by a person other than the sign owner
or promoting an interest other than the rental of the sign has been removed; or
      (4)   Failure to pay any applicable tax or license fee on any billboard
shall also constitute abandonment requiring its removal.
(Prior Code, § 158.081) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005; Ord. 3569, passed 4-21-
2008)
§ 157.082 UNDEVELOPED NON-CONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Definition. This section applies only to undeveloped non-conforming
lots, which shall include all non-conforming lots that do not have a structure
in excess of 600 square feet in floor area constructed for a main permitted use
in the zoning district at the time of construction.
   (B)   Effect of non-conforming lot area. Except as provided herein, when a
non-conforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations
applicable to the intended use; except that the lot is smaller than the
required minimum lot area applicable to that zoning district, then the lot may
be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use that
requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a
particular district is permissible on a non-conforming lot.
   (C)   Prohibition on grouping of non-conforming lots. Subject to the
following sentence, if, on the effective date of this chapter, an undeveloped
non-conforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other
undeveloped lots under the same ownership, then neither the owner of the non-
conforming lot, nor his or her successors in interest, may take advantage of
the provisions of this section. This division (C) shall not apply to a non-
conforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of
the street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of the lot are also
non-conforming. The intent of this division (C) is to require non-conforming
lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under
the circumstances specified herein, but not to require such combination when
that would be out of character with the existing neighborhood.
(Prior Code, § 158.082) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.083 COMPLETION OF NON-CONFORMING PROJECTS; VESTED RIGHTS.
   (A)   Administrative permits. All permits issued by an administrative
official or body, or legislative body acting in an administrative capacity,
prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be valid until their
expiration under the previously existing regulations. Applications for
administrative permits submitted after the effective date of these regulations
shall be reviewed and evaluated pursuant to the requirements of this chapter,
except as further specified below.
   (B)   Completion of initiated projects. All non-conforming projects on which
construction was lawfully commenced at least 30 days before the effective date
of this chapter may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits,
so long as those permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and
unexpired, and a vested rights permit is obtained from the Director. If a
development is designed to be completed in stages, this division (B) shall
apply only to the particular phase under construction.
   (C)   Requirement to obtain vested right permit. 
      (1)   Except as provided in divisions (A) and (B) above, all work on any
non-conforming project shall cease on the effective date of this chapter, and
all work on non-conforming projects may be continued only pursuant to a vested
rights permit issued in accordance with this chapter by the City Council. The
City Council shall approve a permit if it finds that the applicant has proven:
         (a)   It has in good faith made unrecoverable substantial expenditures
or incurred substantial binding obligations;
         (b)   The applicant otherwise has changed position in some substantial
way in reasonable reliance on the regulations as they existed before the
effective date of this chapter and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if
not allowed to complete the project as proposed; or
         (c)   Is otherwise entitled to a vested rights permit as a matter of
law.
      (2)   To the extent that a non-conforming project can be made conforming
and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized
in the completion of a conforming project, a person shall not be considered
prejudiced by having made the expenditures.
   (D)   Completion of phases. When a project was intended to be or reasonably
could be completed in phases, stages, segments or other discrete units, the
person shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect
to which the person can make the showing required under division (B) above.
   (E)   Limitation on vested right permit applications. The City Council shall
not consider any application for a vested rights permit authorized by division
(B) above that is submitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this
chapter. The Commission may waive this requirement for good cause shown, but,
in no case, may it extend the application deadline beyond one year from the
effective date of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.083) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.084 SPECIAL USE PERMIT AUTHORIZING ALTERATION OF THE NON-CONFORMITY.
   (A)   Whenever a special use permit is required by this subchapter to alter
a non-conformity, such permit may be issued by the Commission subject to the
provisions of this section.
   (B)   Such special use permit shall be subject to the same procedures and
standards for the granting of a special use permit pursuant to §§
157.095 through
157.102, including the imposition of appropriate conditions for approval, and
with the additional required findings that:
      (1)   The intended change in use, alteration or repair of structure or
property or continuation of non-conformity will not result in a violation of
the purposes of the applicable provisions;
      (2)   All of the applicable requirements of this chapter are met to the
extent reasonably possible; and
      (3)   The proposed use would be otherwise lawful.
   (C)   Compliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably
possible if compliance cannot be achieved without purchase of additional land
to the lot where the non-conforming situation exists or without moving a
substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. Mere financial
hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does
not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible.
Further, in no case may an applicant be given permission, pursuant to this
division (C), to construct a building or add to an existing building if in
doing so additional non-conformities would be created. Nothing in this division
(C) shall be interpreted to require the granting of a special use permit for a
non-conformity authorized under this section where all requirements or
standards are not determined to exist. Multiple contiguous lots in common
ownership shall not be considered independent lots in determining a hardship.
The permit shall specify which non-conformities need not be corrected.
(Prior Code, § 158.084) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
SPECIAL USES
§ 157.095 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   The division of the city into zoning districts is based on the principle
that similar conditions prevail throughout a particular district. Some uses of
land are not appropriate as a “permitted use” in certain districts and are
designated as special uses. Because they have a unique, special or unusual
impact upon the use of enjoyment or neighboring property, these uses are only
appropriate at a certain locations and upon receipt of a special use permit.
Special uses shall be permitted only as provided herein and consistent with 65
ILCS 5/11-13-1.1. Unless otherwise provided by this chapter, a special use
shall be subject to all of the regulations applicable within the zoning
district in which the special use is authorized in addition to such other
regulations as established by the terms or conditions of the special use permit
that supplement, but may not reduce, such otherwise applicable minimum
regulations.
(Prior Code, § 158.095) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)
§ 157.096 WHEN SPECIAL USE PERMIT REQUIRED.
   A landowner shall obtain a special use permit prior to the issuance of a
building permit:
   (A)   For any use listed as a “special use” in the applicable zoning
district; and
   (B)   For any use otherwise requiring a special use permit by this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.096) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)
§ 157.097 SPECIAL USE PERMIT; APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Any person owning or having a cognizable interest in a given property
may file an application.
   (B)   Except as may be omitted upon written consent of the Director, the
following items shall be submitted in support of an application for a special
use permit:
      (1)   All general application requirements, including, but not limited
to, §§
157.270 through
157.282;
      (2)   All preliminary and final site plan requirements contained in §§
157.050 through
157.060 or as otherwise required by this code;
      (3)   A comprehensive narrative description of the use sought;
      (4)   Development schedule providing reasonable guarantees for the
completion of the proposed development or other construction according to the
development schedule;
      (5)   Any land areas within the environmental corridor (see Environmental
Corridor Map Appendix in the Environmental/Landscape Framework Plan);
      (6)   A statement regarding the requested length of term of the use after
the date of issuance of the permit, if applicable;
      (7)   A statement regarding any special conditions governing the
operation of the proposed use(s), site development and other pertinent
descriptive factors;
      (8)   Color photographs of surrounding structures within 250 feet and
elevation drawings of the proposed special use in sufficient detail to
determine compliance with the zoning district regulations in which the special
use is to be located;
      (9)   A landscaping plan and any screening elements; and
      (10)   Such other information as may be required by the Director relevant
to the specific application to ensure compliance with the purposes and
provisions of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.097) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)

         (c)   Refer the application back to the applicant for modification or
to the Director for additional review or study if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
      (3)   Any completed application submitted in conformance with this
subchapter shall be deemed denied by the Planning Commission, for purposes of
appeal to the Council, if no final written action has been rendered within 120
days from the date the complete application is filed. In such case, the
applicant shall file its written appeal with the City Council within ten days
thereafter to seek Council review.
   (C)   Standards for considering applications.
      (1)   A special use may be permitted only upon the applicant presenting
evidence and bearing the burden of proof that such use meets the standards and
requirements established for such classification in this chapter, and the
granting of the permit may be subject to such conditions necessary to meet such
standards.
      (2)   No special use permit may be granted unless the Planning Commission
finds:
         (a)   The special use is necessary for the public convenience at that
location;
         (b)   The special use is not injurious to the use and enjoyment of
neighboring properties, nor detrimental to the public health, safety, morals or
general welfare;
         (c)   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary
supporting facilities have been provided for;
         (d)   Adequate measures have been provided to accommodate ingress and
egress so as to avoid congestion, not unduly impede surrounding traffic flows
or create hazardous or unsafe conditions;
         (e)   The special uses will not adversely impact property values in
the neighborhood; and/or
         (f)   The special use will conforms to all other requirements of the
district.
      (3)   In considering any special use application, the Commission and the
City Council may give consideration to the criteria stated below to the extent
they are pertinent to the particular application. The Commission and City
Council also may consider other factors that may be relevant to a particular
application.
         (a)   Satisfaction of any and all conditions and requirements
applicable to the requested special use, as set forth in supplementary use
regulations;
         (b)   The existing uses and zoning of nearby property;
         (c)   The extent to which property values are diminished by the

         (d)   The extent to which the destruction of property values, if any,
of the property to be rezoned or nearby property promotes the health, safety,
morals or general welfare of the public;
         (e)   The relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship
imposed on the individual property owner;
         (f)   The suitability of the property for the zoned purpose;
         (g)   The length of time the property has remained vacant as zoned
considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of
the subject property;
         (h)   The public need for the proposed use;
         (i)   The extent to which the proposed use will adversely affect the
capacity or safety of that portion of the street network impacted by the use,
or present parking problems in the vicinity of the property;
         (j)   The extent to which the proposed use will create excessive
stormwater runoff, air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution or other
environmental harm;
         (k)   The extent to which public facilities and services are available
and adequate to meet the demand for facilities and services generated by the
proposed use;

         (m)   The recommendation of prof- essional staff.
   (D)   Denial. If the application is denied, the applicant shall not again
apply within 12 months for a special use permit for substantially the same
proposal unless there has occurred a substantial change of circumstances and
the Commission consents to resubmission of substantially the same proposal.
Otherwise, substantially the same proposal shall be submitted no earlier than
one year after the date of denial. If the application is referred back to the

decision, the City Council, upon majority vote, may exercise the power of
review of any Planning Commission decision on an application for a special use
permit.
      (2)   Upon adoption of the motion to exercise the power of review, the
City Council may refer the matter to the Committee. Following this adoption,
and before acting on the special use permit, the City Council may set the
matter for hearing before the Committee or the City Council. The City Council
will give written notice of any such hearing to the applicant and all other
persons who appeared and spoke at the public hearing before the Planning
Commission. In addition, the City Council may, in its discretion, notify and
allow to be heard at the hearing any other person who the Council believes may
be aggrieved by any decision or action concerning the special use permit.
      (3)   Following its review, the City Council may affirm, reverse or
modify, in whole or in part, any determination of the Planning Commission. An
affirmative majority vote of the City Council shall be required to overturn or
modify a decision by the Planning Commission concerning a special use permit.
The decision of the City Council shall be made within 45 days of the Planning
Commission vote, unless extended for specified cause by a majority vote of the
Council, or the Planning Commission decision shall become final.
      (4)   Unless the City Council exercises its power of review of a special
use permit, the decision of the Planning Commission shall become effective
after 21 days following its decision.

§ 157.099 VESTING OF RIGHTS.
   (A)   The mere issuance of a special use permit gives no vested rights to
the permit holder.
   (B)   A right to continue a specially permitted use shall vest only if the
project is constructed and the use actually begun, and only for as long as may
be specified in the permit.
   (C)   The right to continue the special use that was permitted prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall last only as long as specified by the
special use permit.
   (D)   As of the effective date of this chapter, existing permits shall be
subject to the provisions for transferability as expressed in this chapter.
   (E)   Uses that are allowed without a special use permit prior to the
effective date of this chapter, but are designated as special uses in this
chapter, shall be allowed to continue as non-conforming uses if the
requirements of §§
157.240 through
157.243,
157.255 through
157.257 and
157.270 through
157.282 are satisfied.
(Prior Code, § 158.099) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)
§ 157.100 PUBLIC BUILDINGS, PUBLIC UTILITY BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   Except where the use is otherwise designated as a permitted or planned use
pursuant to another section of this chapter, the Planning Commission may, by
special use permit, authorize any other building or use of the city, the
county, the township, public school district, university, any state or federal
agency or public utility in either a governmental or proprietary capacity, in
any zoning district as the Commission deems necessary for the convenience and
welfare. Such building, structure or use shall be subject to such of the
requirements of the district wherein the building, structure or use is situated
and to such of the other regulations applying to uses permitted in the
development as the Commission deems necessary to comply with the general
provisions of this chapter and to assure compatibility of the development with
the character of its locality.
(Prior Code, § 158.100) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)
§ 157.101 FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN; TRANSFERABILITY, LAPSE, EXPIRATION AND
REVOCATION.
   (A)   Final development plan; effective date of permit. Unless otherwise
specified in the terms of the special use permit, such permit shall be
effective to authorize the use granted therein only upon approval of a final
development plan and recording thereof as provided for final development plans,
elsewhere in this chapter. (See §
157.054(E).)
   (B)   Transferability.
      (1)   A special use permit may be conveyed with the land only if a right
to continue the use has vested under the terms of this subchapter. The transfer
of a permit in which no right has vested shall be invalid. Nothing in this
subchapter shall be construed to alter the expiration date of permits or the
authority of the City Council to revoke a permit.
      (2)   A permit cannot be assigned or transferred to a different parcel of
land.
      (3)   Every entity attempting to convey a special use permit shall give
notice in writing to the Director within 72 hours after having sold,
transferred, given away or otherwise disposed of an interest in or control of a
parcel of land for which a special use permit has been issued. Such notice
shall include the name and address of the successor in interest or control of
the parcel. Receipt of such notice shall not constitute acceptance of an
invalid transfer.
   (C)   Lapse. A special use permit in which no vested right has been
established shall lapse and become void unless the applicant applies for any
building permit incident to the proposed use within one year of the date of
approval by the City Council. Upon the written request of the property owner
and for good cause shown, the City Council may grant one extension of not more
than one year. An application for extension will be considered only if it is
submitted, in writing, prior to the expiration of the initial period.
   (D)   Expiration of permit. The approved special use permit may specify the
duration of its validity and shall expire, unless renewed by approval of a new
special use permit as provided herein. A special use permit shall also expire
if no final site plan has been submitted and approved within 12 months from the
date of the special use permit approval. The City Council may grant one site
plan extension not exceeding 12 months upon written request. The approval of a
revised preliminary site plan shall not automatically extend the time period
during which the preliminary site plan and/or special use permit is valid. An
expired special use permit shall grant no authority of any kind upon such
expiration and no use shall be permitted to continue thereafter in reliance on
such permit authority.
   (E)   Revocation. Any special use permit granted under the authority of this
section is subject to revocation for any or all of the following reasons:
      (1)   Non-compliance with any applicable requirement as set forth in this
subchapter;
      (2)   Non-compliance with any special conditions imposed at the time of
approval or renewal of the special use permit;
      (3)   Violation of any provisions of the code of ordinances pertaining to
the use of the land, construction or uses of buildings or structures or
activities conducted on the premises by the permit holder, agents of the permit
holder or tenants;
      (4)   Violation of any other applicable provisions of the code of
ordinances or any state or federal law or regulation by the permit holder,
agents of the permit holder or tenants; provided that such violations relate to
the conduct or activity authorized by the special use permit or the
qualifications of such persons to engage in the permitted use;
      (5)   Attempted transfer of a permit in violation of this subchapter; and
      (6)   Revocation is necessary to preserve the public health, safety and
welfare.
   (F)   Procedure for revocation.
      (1)   Revocation proceedings may be initiated by the City Council.
      (2)   Unless the permit holder and the landowner agree, in writing, that
the permit may be revoked, the City Council shall hold a public hearing to
consider the revocation of the special use permit.
      (3)   The city shall give the permit holder and landowner notice of the
scheduled revocation hearing at least 15 days prior to the date scheduled for
such hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested. If such notice cannot
be delivered or is not accepted, notice may be given by publishing a notice of
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or by posting a
notice of hearing on the property at least 15 days prior to the date scheduled
for the hearing.
      (4)   The public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with rules of
procedure established by the City Council. At the conclusion of the public
hearing, the City Council may render its decision or take the matter under
advisement.
      (5)   No special use permit shall be revoked unless a majority of the
City Council is satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that grounds for
revocation exist. Any motion for the revocation of a special use permit shall
clearly state the grounds for revocation.
(Prior Code, § 158.101) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)
§ 157.102 VIOLATIONS.
   No property for which a special use permit has been granted shall be used or
developed contrary to the requirements of such permit and final site plan,
unless such permit is amended by approval granted in the manner as provided for
the initial approval of a special use permit; provided that nothing herein
shall preclude additional particulars or requirements in a final site plan or
an amended final site plan as may be necessary to satisfy the conditions of the
special use permit. In addition to the other remedies for violation provided
herein, such violations are subject to all other penalties and enforcement
provisions as established for other violations of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.102) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)
PLANNED USES
§ 157.115 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   The division of the city into zoning districts is based on the principle
that similar conditions should prevail throughout a particular district. Some
uses of land are appropriate neither as a “permitted use”, nor a “special use”,
in certain districts and are, therefore, designated as planned uses or are
otherwise subject to the “planned use” site plan approval process of this
subchapter where such specified circumstances exist. It is the intent of this
subchapter to authorize these “planned uses” only where the location and
circumstances are appropriate to the use and a site plan is approved by the
City Council. It is also the intent of this subchapter to increase the
flexibility of development design through evaluation and approval of a site
plan applying site-specific regulations. Approval of a planned use and
corresponding site plan shall be considered a legislative act of rezoning. Any
ordinance approving a site plan for a planned use shall be deemed to
incorporate the provisions of this chapter. The term PLANNED USE shall mean the
specified use, associated site plans and corresponding “overlay district”
regulations authorized pursuant to this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.115) (Ord. 3471, passed 8-21-2006)

the intent of this code, including, but not limited to, the intent of this
section that no resumed use cause a greater impact or intensity than the prior
use in light of the current circumstances.
   (D)   Unlisted uses. The table of uses contained in this chapter and the
specific uses or circumstances set forth in this subchapter for planned uses do
not necessarily reflect all of the regulations that may apply to particular
uses or districts. However, any use not listed herein nor shown in the table of
uses as a special use, planned use or a use permitted by right in the
applicable zoning district or authorized as an accessory use shall be
prohibited unless the City Council, after review by the Planning Commission,
determines that the proposed use is sufficiently similar to a use expressly
authorized in the applicable district and is not otherwise prohibited or
intended to be prohibited by this chapter or other applicable regulations and
such determination is approved by the City Council. Except as provided in this
division (D), uses not listed and expressly authorized have been determined
either not to be appropriate in any district, incompatible with certain
existing uses or sufficiently rare or unexpected as to be incapable of being
listed at the time of adoption of this chapter. Any use not delineated in this
chapter as a use permitted by right, a special use or a planned use in any
zoning district, but which nevertheless constitutes a use that is required by
law to be permitted within the city shall be authorized only in the Industrial
District subject to the following conditions.
      (1)   The use shall be permitted only to the extent required by law to be
permitted.
      (2)   The use shall be approved only as a planned use, except if, by law,
it is required to be permitted by right.

residence, residential property, park, school or church, except as may be
modified by the City Council through a planned use procedure.
      (4)   The use shall maintain a distance of at least 1,000 feet from any
other such use.
      (5)   No use shall occupy a structure in excess of 5,000 square feet
without an approved alternate parking plan designed for that use and supported
by a traffic study submitted to and approved by the City Council.
   (E)   Planned use exemption: Regency Park and Central Park Commercial area.
For property zoned B-1 or B-1(P) having frontage along the Regency Park Drive,
Central Park Drive, Central Park Circle or Park Plaza Drive, the following use
(s) shall not be subject to planned use requirement, and may be approved
administratively by site plan, unless a planned use is required by other
aspects of the use:
      (1)   Restaurants, including liquor sales and consumption on premises,
not having a drive-through;
   Any exempt use shall conform with the “Commercial Design Handbook” and all
other code requirements to qualify for the exemption. Where the Director
reasonably believes a use exempted under this provision is not fully compliant
with all applicable requirements and standards or creates a risk to safety or
property, the Director may require the use to be submitted as a planned use
notwithstanding this exemption. Otherwise, where the Director determines that
the site plan is also fully compliant, the site plan shall be submitted to the
City Council for administrative approval, denial or condition by resolution or
motion. Additional information as may be required by the Director, including,
but not limited to, traffic impact study, access management plan, geologic
hazard study, environmental impact report, historic inventory study and data
which estimates and document how the project will affect population,
employment, schools, parks streets, utilities, public safety and other city
services.

plan.
(Prior Code, § 158.118) (Ord. 3471, passed 8-21-2006)
§ 157.119 CONSIDERATION OF A PLANNED USE.
   (A)   Procedure. Except as established by this section, the procedures and
requirements for filing, review and approval of a planned use and a preliminary
site plan shall be as specified in §§
157.240 through
157.243,
157.255 through
157.257 and
157.270 through
157.282 for approval or review of amendments to a zoning district
classification or boundary, and additionally all such other requirements as
provided in §§
157.050 through
157.060 for application and review of preliminary site plans.
   (B)   Criteria for approval.
      (1)   The Planning Director and City Council shall use the applicable
zoning district regulations and this subchapter as criteria for review of the
proposed planned use and preliminary site plan. The City Council may permit
modification from the underlying district regulations, but except as so
expressly modified, the underlying district regulations shall continue to apply
to any approved planned use. Use regulations, however, shall not be modified so
as to allow uses not otherwise permitted by this chapter in the underlying
zoning district governing the property, or underlying regulations of the
applicant’s proposed rezoning. If the City Council imposes conditions or
restrictions on a preliminary site plan, it may designate specific requirements
that must be met before an applicant may submit a final site plan application.
      (2)   In considering any planned development and preliminary site plan
application, the Planning Commission and the City Council shall give
consideration to the additional criteria stated below, to the extent they are
pertinent to the particular application:
         (a)   The criteria governing the rezoning of the property and approval
of site plans, as set forth in the standards and requirements found elsewhere
in the Zoning Code or in other applicable law;
         (b)   The physical design of the proposed plan and the manner in which
said design makes adequate provisions for public services, provides adequate
control over vehicular traffic, provides for and protects designated common
open space and park dedication and furthers the amenities of light, air,
recreation and visual enjoyment;
         (c)   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to
adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood;
         (d)   The conformity with the standards and principles of the
comprehensive plan and all other adopted regulations, including the 2040 Master
Plan on file with the City Clerk;
         (e)   The use(s) are designed, located and proposed to be operated so
that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected;
         (f)   An identified community need exists for the proposed use;
         (g)   The proposed use(s) will not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of the surrounding property, nor impair the use,
enjoyment or value of neighboring properties;
         (h)   The degree of harmony between the architectural quality of the
proposed building and the surrounding neighborhood; and
         (i)   The appropriateness of the minimum dimensions and areas of lots
and yards set forth in the applicable zoning district regulations.
   (C)   Planned use approval; conditions. A planned use shall be approved only
by ordinance pursuant to the procedures for rezoning set forth in §§
157.240 through
157.243,
157.255 through
157.257 and
157.270 through
157.282, setting for the specific the requirements of the approval. The
approving ordinance shall approve a preliminary site plan, subject to any
changes or conditions required by the City Council and may specifically set
forth the specific uses, authorized density and/or building coverages, design
requirements, public improvements and other conditions or requirements of the
approved preliminary development plan. Consistent with the purposes of this
subchapter, the city may approve a preliminary development plan subject to
conditions as may be necessary to address any impacts of the development on the
public, achieve the purposes of this subchapter or as necessary to warrant a
requested modification of the underlying zoning district regulations. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   The type and extent of improvements and landscaping;
      (2)   The methods or types of development practices, improvements and
common ground required;
      (3)   Maximum bulk of dwelling unit in relationship to lot size or
dimension;
      (4)   Dedication of land, improvements or payment of fees for public open
space, civic space, road improvements, schools or for other infrastructure or
public facilities impacted by the development;
      (5)   Required provisions for funding of maintenance agreements or trust
indentures, including requiring the establishment of an agency for the
ownership and maintenance of any common open space, financial guaranty and/or
limitation on the sale or use of any common open space;
      (6)   Architectural materials or design guidelines as described in the
“Commercial Design Handbook”, dated July 6, 2009 and on file with the City
Clerk;
      (7)   Regulation of permissible uses, mix of uses, hours of operation or
other use restrictions; and
      (8)   Regulation of the duration of approvals, uses, site characteristics
or non-conformities.
   (D)   Change of underlying zoning. A planned use application may be
submitted with an application to change the zoning district category. Any site
plan approved for a planned use, concurrent with such application, shall become
part of the ordinance that amends the zoning district category of the property.
   (E)   Modification of zoning map. Any approved planned use and preliminary
site plan shall be reflected on the zoning map as an amendment of the District
by designation of “(P)” after the district abbreviation of the district in
which the plan was approved.
   (F)   Duration of validity. The approval may specify the duration of a
planned use’s validity, but in no event shall an approved preliminary site plan
be valid for a period longer than two years from the date of such approval. The
City Council may grant no more than three extensions not exceeding 12 months
each upon written request. The approval of a revised preliminary site plan
shall not automatically extend the time period during which the planned use is
valid. In instances where there is another binding agreement between the city
and the development with a longer duration of validity, the provisions of this
section will not apply.

final site plan shall be made by the Director, in writing, to the applicant
upon submission and acceptance of all required materials and information from
the applicant.
   (B)   Sections 157.050 through 157.060 applicable. All requirements for
final site plans set forth in §§
157.050 through
157.060, including changes and modifications, shall apply to a final site plan
for a planned use.
   (C)   Final site plan expiration. Final site plan approval shall, unless a
shorter time is specified, be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of
such approval, unless within such period a building permit is obtained and

§ 157.121 PLANNED USE; AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE STATION OR CONVENIENCE STORE.
   An automotive service station or convenience store shall require a final
site plan and shall be subject to the following conditions and restrictions.
   (A)   Fuel tanks. All tanks shall be below the surface of the ground, except
propane tanks, which shall be subject to approval by the Fire Department.
   (B)   Fuel pumps. Fuel pumps shall be set back 20 feet from the right-of-way
line and 200 feet from a residential dwelling. The design, location, covering,
colors and screening of the gas pumps shall be compatible with the design of
the structures.
   (C)   Vehicle rentals and leasing. Leasing or renting of vehicles or
trailers shall not occur unless specifically approved as part of the
development plan.
   (D)   Traffic. The development shall be located with at least one direct
access to an arterial street, or on a collector street with at least one access
drive within 500 feet of an arterial street. A traffic study shall be required
for all automotive service stations or convenience stores. The person preparing
the report must be a certified engineer qualified to do traffic analyses in the
state. The cost of the study shall be borne by the applicant. The traffic study
shall address potential external and internal traffic circulation concerns, and
the development plan shall not be approved unless all traffic concerns are
adequately addressed to promote safety and reasonable traffic flow.
   (E)   Residential screening. If the applicant intends to remain open for
business past 10:00 p.m., the city may require a buffer if vehicle headlights
from any vehicles entering, parking, standing or exiting would shine onto
residentially zoned property. If the site cannot be screened from residentially
zoned property such that vehicle headlights will not shine onto residentially
zoned property, or if the development would otherwise create a nuisance for
neighboring properties, the hours of operation may be restricted to preclude
operation between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., or any portion thereof
as determined by the Commission and/or governing body.
   (F)   Use authorization. Applicant shall indicate whether the business will
sell alcoholic beverages, maintain video games for use by customers, sell
prepared food for consumption on the premises or off the premises, provide car
washing services, perform mechanical repairs on motor vehicles, provide an
automatic teller machine or sell grocery type items. The development plan shall
specify whether or not the business shall be authorized to perform any or all
of these functions. In evaluating the development plan application, the impact
of any of the foregoing uses on the surrounding area may be considered.
   (G)   Screening. All rooftop or ground-level mechanical equipment, trash and
refuse collection areas, loading areas and outdoor public restrooms shall be
screened from public view with materials and with such design as shall be
approved by the city.
   (H)   Outside sales. The outside sale of merchandise shall be prohibited.
   (I)   Additional standards. The development shall also be subject to such
other applicable standards and requirements as may be found elsewhere in the
Zoning Code or other applicable law.

PARKING AND LOADING
§ 157.135 VEHICLE PARKING; WHEN REQUIRED.
   (A)   At the time of the establishment of any new use, changed use
increasing parking requirements, erection of any building, site plan approval
or at the time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by
adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats or floor area, there shall be
provided permanent vehicle parking spaces improved with an asphalt or concrete
surface in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.
   (B)   The parking spaces may be provided both in an off-street parking lot
and as parallel or other approved parking along streets that are internal to a
development. Parking in the public right-of-way, if available, shall not count
toward satisfying the requirements of this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.135) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970)
§ 157.136 REQUIREMENTS; HOW CALCULATED.
   (A)   Required parking spaces.
      (1)   Parking requirement calculations shall be based on gross square
footage of each land use type, unless otherwise specified. Except as may be
established by an approved alternate parking plan, approved pursuant to §
157.138, parking spaces shall be provided in not less than the number of spaces
(rounded up to the next whole number) necessary to address the applicable use
as set forth on the table entitled, “Minimum Parking Guidelines, By Use”.
Developments containing two or more of the uses listed on the table shall
provide the combined number of spaces required for each use, except as may be
reduced under §
157.138(C).
      (2)   Required additional off-street parking spaces for enlarged or
expanded uses or buildings shall be calculated based only the increased use or
building; provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking spaces
provided for the entire use (preexisting, plus expansion) must equal at least
75% of the minimum ratio established in the table entitled, “Minimum Parking
Guidelines, By Use”. In cases of expansion to parking areas, gravel lots
anywhere on the site shall be upgraded to an asphalt or concrete surface.
   (B)   Calculation of required spaces. For purposes of calculations set forth
in the table, the following terms and methods shall govern.
      (1)   Gross leasable area (“GLA”) shall be determined by the total area
in square feet (“SF”) of all floors intended for occupancy and the exclusive
use of tenants, specifically excluding public or common areas such as utility
rooms, stairwells, enclosed malls and interior hallways; gross floor area
(“GFA”) is determined by the total area in square feet of all floors, measured
between the exterior walls of a building.
      (2)   Parking requirements based on employees or capacity calculations
shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift or
the maximum fire-rated ICC occupant load, whichever is applicable and results
in the greater number of spaces.
      (3)   Parking requirements for churches, theaters or other similar
assembly uses shall be based on a ratio of one parking space required for each
two and one-half seats permanently and/or temporarily placed for the largest
aggregate assembly or assemblies on-site. If seating is horizontal, as with a
pew, one seat is measured as 30 horizontal inches.
      (4)   The required number of stacking spaces for drive-through
establishments shall include the automobile already located at the window,
teller, bay or other applicable drive-through structure.

(Prior Code, § 158.136) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970)
§ 157.137 UNLISTED USES.
   Upon receiving a development application for a use not specifically listed
in the off-street parking table organized by use, the Director shall apply the
off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most
similar to the proposed use unless an alternate parking plan is approved.
(Prior Code, § 158.137) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970)
§ 157.138 ALTERNATE PARKING PLAN.
   (A)   General. The parking requirements established in this subchapter may
be modified by the City Council pursuant to an alternate parking plan, which
shall include a detailed site plan satisfying the minimum requirements of §§
157.050 through
157.060, and reflecting the parking areas, parking space dimensions, driving
aisles, access ways and associated landscaping. An alternate parking plan may
be approved only upon evidence supported by a parking study that the
circumstances justify modification, satisfy the objectives of this subchapter
and are in the public interest. A parking study must include estimates of
parking demand based on recommendations of an IC registered P.E. experienced in
parking studies provided by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (“ITE”),
or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Director and should include
other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the
same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined
by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity and location. The study must
document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. An alternate
parking plan may be subject to any appropriate conditions determined by the
City Council to be necessary to fully mitigate the impact of any modification.
   (B)   Off-street parking reductions for large developments. In order to
prevent the establishment of a greater number of parking spaces than actually
needed to meet the particular needs of large developments of over 150,000
square feet of gross floor area, a reduction in the number of required off-
street parking spaces may be permitted by the Director. Reduction shall be
permitted subject to the following conditions.
      (1)   Maximum reduction. A maximum reduction of one parking space per
every 1,000 square feet of gross floor area or 20% of the total spaces required
(whichever is the lesser reduction) may be permitted. The site plan shall
indicate the location and dimensions of the parking area provided.
      (2)   Reservation. Sufficient area shall be reserved to accommodate the
total number of off-street parking spaces otherwise required by this section.
The purpose of this reservation is to ensure adequate area is available to meet
any future need for additional parking spaces. The reserved area shall be
located on the same site and noted on the site plan. The reserved parking area
shall not include areas for required landscaping, setbacks or areas that would
otherwise be unusable for parking due to the physical characteristics of the
land or the requirements of this subchapter. Any uses being requesting and
approved for a parking reserve shall have an annual occupancy inspection
performed to determine continued compliance with this section.
      (3)   Installation of additional spaces. The Director shall be authorized
to require that the developer install additional parking spaces, up to the
total number otherwise required by this section, if the Director determines
that, at their sole cost, additional parking spaces set aside in the reserve
area are necessary to satisfy the off-street parking needs of the use at any
time in the future.
   (C)   Guidelines; shared parking. Required parking spaces shall be provided
for and assigned to each use, except for “shared parking”, which may be
approved subject to each of the following requirements.
      (1)   Parking spaces that are proposed for shared parking among two or
more uses must be clearly available to each use and not appear in any way to be
serving a particular use, either through signage dedicating the spaces or
through design techniques that would tend to orient use of the spaces to a
particular business or building.
      (2)   Sites used for shared parking shall be in common ownership with the
uses or consist of not more than two contiguous parcel within or adjacent to
such uses and subject to a shared access and a written joint-maintenance
agreement binding and benefitting each proposed use, as approved by the
Director. The approved agreement shall be recorded and a copy supplied to the
Director. Any uses requesting and approved for a parking reserve shall have an
annual occupancy inspection performed to determine continued compliance with
this section.
      (3)   All shared parking spaces on the site(s) shall comply with the
minimum requirements for dimensions required in this subchapter.
      (4)   The application of shared parking shall not reduce the total
parking spaces provided to the combined uses to less than 50% of what would
have been required for the combined uses without application of shared parking.
(Prior Code, § 158.138) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970)
§ 157.139 GUIDELINES; DOWNTOWN DISTRICT PARKING.
   (A)   “Downtown District” defined. For purposes of this section, DOWNTOWN
DISTRICT shall mean the “Downtown District” zoning classification as
established in this code, or such other districts as established for use or
authorized in the Downtown Planning Sub-Area of the city comprehensive plan.
   (B)   Residential uses. No on-site vehicle parking shall be required for
existing or re-developed second story dwelling units located within existing
buildings in the Downtown District. For construction of a new building with
more than two dwelling units, parking shall be provided on-site for the
property at the rate of one and one-quarter spaces per dwelling unit (rounded
up to the nearest whole number of spaces).
   (C)   Non-residential uses.
      (1)   Vehicle parking.
         (a)   In the Downtown District, the vehicle parking space number
requirements of this subchapter for non-residential uses shall apply only to
the net increase in floor area or use intensity created by new construction or
building expansion. For any increase in parking required through new
construction or expansion of existing non-residential buildings, the applicant
must submit a parking study per this code to determine the number of parking
spaces to be required on-site.
         (b)   Any existing vehicle parking spaces that are eliminated by new
construction or expansion must be replaced by that business or use, unless such
spaces are in excess of the total requirements for that business or use being
served, and are in the same ownership.
      (2)   Loading. In the Downtown District, uses that prefer to provide
loading from the street may have the option of applying for a permit for a curb
loading zone as provided for by the city.
(Prior Code, § 158.139) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970)
§ 157.140 DEDICATION TO PARKING USE.
   (A)   Parking spaces provided to meet the minimum requirements of this
subchapter, along with the aisles and driveways necessary to provide access to
those spaces, shall not be used for any other purpose than the temporary
vehicle parking unless a special event permit is obtained pursuant to this code
which specifically provides that parking spaces may be used or occupied by the
temporary event.
   (B)   Specifically, no such parking area may be used for the sale of
vehicles or for the sale, display or storage of equipment, goods, materials or
supplies without a special event permit.
   (C)   No repair, dismantling or servicing of any vehicles is permitted
unless authorized as part of the permitted use of the property.
   (D)   Unless otherwise approved by zoning or permit, parking areas shall not
be used for overnight parking of trucks, recreational vehicles or occupied
vehicles.
(Prior Code, § 158.140) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970)
§ 157.141 PROXIMITY OF VEHICLE PARKING SPACES TO USE.
   (A)   Parking spaces shall be located on the same property containing the
use for which they are required unless specifically authorized by variance of
the City Council.
   (B)   In the event a parking variance is received, the following shall in
all cases apply.
      (1)   The parking must be provided on a property with the same zoning
classification as the property that the spaces serve, or a less restrictive
zoning classification.
      (2)   No required parking spaces may be located across any state or
United States highway from the use they are intended to serve.
      (3)   Off-property variances may be granted up to 200 feet away in RR,
SR, MR, MH or B-1 or B-2 Districts or within 500 feet in Agricultural or
Industrial Districts.
   (C)   Existing buildings in the Downtown Business District may satisfy the
parking space number requirement if the front door is within 500 feet of a
municipal parking lot.
(Prior Code, § 158.141) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970; Ord. 3817, passed 2-18-
2014)
§ 157.142 REQUIREMENTS FOR DESIGN OF PARKING LOTS.
   The provisions of this section apply to all vehicle parking spaces and
parking areas, whether the parking meets or exceeds the number of spaces
established in this subchapter to serve a particular use or the parking lot is
operated as a principal use on a property and not dedicated to serving a
particular use.
   (A)   Orientation to street. Except for parcels of land devoted to one-
family, two-family or townhouse residential uses, all areas devoted to vehicle
parking shall be so designed and be of such size that no vehicle is required to
back into a public street to obtain access.
   (B)   Vehicle parking spaces.
      (1)   No parking spaces shall be accessible from an access driveway
within the first 20 feet of the driveway back from the street right-of-way
line.
      (2)   (a)   Every parking space shall provide a useable rectangular area
at least ten feet wide by 19 feet long.
         (b)   Access aisles shall not encroach into this minimum rectangular
area.
         (c)   Every parking space shall be clearly demarcated by lines painted
on or otherwise applied to the parking lot surface.
         (d)   Full parking modules shall be 62 feet in width
(19’+24’+19’=62’).
   (C)   Access and circulation.
      (1)   Access aisles in parking lots and other parking space dimensions
shall conform to the table in this division (C).
      (2)   Ingress and egress to parking areas shall be by means of paved
driveways from the adjoining street. The minimum width of driveways for ingress
and egress shall be the same as those specified above for aisles. Driveway
width, for the purpose of this section, shall include only the pavement and not
the curbs and gutters.
      (3)   The distance of a parking area entrance drive from the intersection
of two streets, and the distance between curb cuts, shall be based on the
street design standards set forth in a policy memorandum on file with the
Director. All measurements shall be taken along the right-of-way lines.

   (D)   Lighting of parking areas. Any lights used to illuminate the parking
area shall be arranged, located or screened to direct light away from any
adjoining residential use so as to not cause glare or excessive light
spillover. Lighting in parking areas shall meet the minimum requirements of §
157.143.
   (E)   Improvement of parking areas.
      (1)   Surfacing and curbing.
         (a)   All vehicle parking areas and all access drives shall be
improved with a permanent dust-free surface consisting of a minimum of a six-
inch rolled stone base overlaid with a two or more inch asphalt surface, or a
four-inch asphalt base overlaid with a two-inch asphalt surface. Concrete
parking areas and driving aisles shall be a minimum of six inches in thickness.
         (b)   In the Industrial Zoning Districts, the following alternative
surface will be allowed in areas limited to vehicle, material and equipment
storage areas, except areas specifically used for loading and unloading: a six-
inch rolled stone base, sealed with a bituminous seal. The sealer is to be
covered with a dust-free chipped rock surface of sufficient depth to prevent
pick-up of the sealer coat by vehicle tires, at least three-eighths inches
thick.
         (c)   All vehicle parking areas and all access drives in office,
commercial and industrial zoning districts shall have a boundary constructed of
vertical concrete curbing (Type CG-1) or an integral concrete sidewalk and curb
with a vertical face.
      (2)   Maintenance. Vehicle parking areas shall be maintained in proper
repair with a dust-free surface.
      (3)   Drainage facilities. For any use that will require a parking area
to be newly constructed, added to or altered so as to affect drainage either on
or off the site, as determined by the Director, stormwater drainage plans,
including grading plans, shall be submitted to and approved by the Director,
prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy.
Appropriate detention/retention may be required in accordance with the land
development and stormwater drainage requirements of the city.
      (4)   Permit required. No person shall initiate construction of a new
parking lot or expansion of an existing parking lot, without first obtaining a
permit from the Director. Application for a permit shall be made upon the form
provided and shall be accompanied by such information, plans and specifications
as may be required. A permit shall not be required for resurfacing an existing
parking area unless major reconstruction of the surface and base are required
which may indicate subsurface deficiencies needing to be addressed by upgraded
design standards; and a permit shall not be required for construction or
alteration of customary driveways for single-family and two-family residential
dwellings unless construction shall occur in the public right-of-way and cause
the sidewalk and/or curb to be modified.
      (5)   Time limit. All required vehicle parking areas shall be ready for
use, including the above surfacing requirement, before the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy (in the case of a new building or addition). Relief
from the time limitations of this division (E)(5) may be granted by the
Director due only to adverse weather conditions. In the event such relief is
granted, a letter of credit or performance bond shall be required to be posted
in accordance with the requirements of the city.
(Prior Code, § 158.142) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970)
§ 157.143 LIGHTING.
   (A)   Illumination levels shall be measured with a photoelectric photometer
having a spectral response similar to that of the human eye, following the
standard spectral luminous efficiency curve adopted by the International
Commission on Illumination.
   (B)   All outdoor lighting shall comply with the following standards.
      (1)   All illumination structures, except for approved street lights,
shall be shaded, shielded or directed to prevent direct light from being cast
upon any adjacent property or public right-of-way and to prevent glare or other
objectionable problems to surrounding areas.
      (2)   No light fixture shall have any blinking, flashing or fluttering
lights or other illuminating device which has a changing light intensity,
brightness or color, nor shall any beacon or spot lights be permitted.
      (3)   Neither the direct, nor reflected light from any light fixture
shall create a disabling glare causing traffic hazards to motor vehicle
operators on public roadways.
      (4)   Any non-residential off-street parking or loading area in use at
night shall contain a system of lighting to provide an adequate standard of at
least one foot-candle of illumination over the area of the parking area to be
used.
      (5)   Lighting shall be designed so as not to create more than one foot-
candle of illumination at any residentially zoned property boundary, or more
than five foot-candles at any commercially zoned property boundary.
      (6)   Light fixtures used to illuminate objects mounted on a pole,
platform or pedestal shall not use a spotlight that will extend beyond the
illuminated object. Uplighting of these structures shall cease after 11:00
p.m., except for uplighting of the American flag, or unless otherwise
regulated.
      (7)   All parking area lighting shall be located within a landscaped area
or island.
      (8)   (a)   All exposed portion of pedestals or platforms on which
parking lighting may be mounted shall be designed with an approved decorative
material or finish so as to eliminate exposed concrete finish appearance. All
other outdoor light fixtures lawfully installed prior to and operable on the
effective date of this chapter are exempt from all requirements unless:
            1.   Existing outdoor lighting fixtures are replaced, removed or
reinstalled; or
            2.   Existing outdoor lighting systems are judged to be a nuisance
due to excessive, objectionable light emission as assessed by the Director; or
if the emissions cause unsafe or hazardous conditions. Upon notice by the
Director, the owner of such lighting system will have 30 days to comply with
the provisions as set forth in this section. A 30-day extension may be granted
by the Director.
         (b)   The Director may require a special inspection to ascertain
compliance with this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.143) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970)
§ 157.144 PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.
   Parking lot landscaping shall be provided within any parking lot designed or
intended to accommodate five cars or more, in accordance with the following.
   (A)   Type of tree and method of installation shall be consistent with the
requirements of §§
155.070 through
155.076.
   (B)   All planting areas within a parking lot or vehicular use area shall be
curbed with a minimum six-inch high rolled or vertical concrete curbs.
   (C)   Landscaping islands and tree planting areas shall be well drained and
contain suitable soil and irrigation characteristics for the planting materials
they contain; in-ground irrigation systems may be required as determined by the
City Council.
   (D)   Landscape islands include the following.
      (1)   Single island. There shall be an island with a minimum landscape
width of seven feet and a minimum area of 120 square feet, placed at the ends
of a single row of parking, each containing at least one deciduous tree. The
island shall contain a minimum of one deciduous tree and one shrub and include
grass, or ground cover, except for those areas that are mulched.
      (2)   Double island. There shall be a double island of 240 square feet
placed at the ends of double row of parking. Two deciduous trees and two shrubs
are required per double landscape island.
      (3)   Parking rows. Parking rows shall be interrupted by an intermediary
landscaped island every 20 contiguous, side by side spaces, with the island
meeting the minimum landscape width, area and tree count as identified in
divisions (D)(1) and (D)(2) above.
      (4)   Median. For every five parking modules (62-foot minimum per module)
included in a site, a seven-foot wide landscaped median shall be required, for
the length of a centrally located row to visually break up and segment
expansive parking lots. A deciduous tree shall be planted at intervals of 50
feet.
   (E)   All parking lots containing more than five parking spaces shall be
screened from public streets and sidewalks, public open spaces and adjacent
properties by complying with one of the following perimeter landscaping options
or an alternative compliance plan which has been approved pursuant to §
157.188:
      (1)   The outside perimeter of all parking areas and drive aisles shall
include a landscaped area seven feet in width. One tree selected from the
city’s list of acceptable street trees or as otherwise approved by the city
shall be planted every 50 feet on center within the landscape perimeter. When a
parking lot tree planting strip abuts a public right-of-way containing an
existing or proposed street tree planting area, the city may grant an exception
on a case-by-case basis if it is determined that a duplication may occur; or
      (2)   A minimum five-foot wide perimeter-landscaped area with ornamental
fencing, masonry wall or opaque hedge and an approved street tree planted every
50 feet. A two-foot car overhang area shall be provided in any planting area
adjacent to parking stalls.
   (F)   All landscape areas required by this chapter are to be maintained in
good condition in a manner consistent with the plan approved for the site.

SIGNS
§ 157.160 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. This subchapter establishes comprehensive regulations for the
control of signs in order to preserve, protect and promote the public health,
safety and general welfare. More specifically, this subchapter is intended to
assist in achieving the following objectives:
      (1)   To authorize the use of signs that are:
         (a)   Compatible with their surroundings and the zoning district in
which they are located;
         (b)   Expressive of the image the city desires to project;
         (c)   Appropriate to the type of establishment or activity to which
they pertain;
         (d)   Legible in the circumstances in which they are seen; and
         (e)   Not distracting or cluttered in a manner that disturbs the safe
and free flow of traffic or in a manner that may be fully or partially
attributable to an increased risk of traffic accidents.
      (2)   To foster high quality commercial and industrial development, and
to enhance the economic vitality of existing businesses/industries by promoting
the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs;
      (3)   To encourage sound sign display practices, and to mitigate the
objectionable effects of competition in respect to the size and placement of
signs;
      (4)   To enhance the physical appearance of the city by protecting the
human-made and natural beauty of the area;
      (5)   To preserve the value of private property by assuring the
compatibility of signs with nearby land uses; and
      (6)   To enable fair and consistent enforcement of these sign
regulations.
   (B)   Scope.
      (1)   This subchapter contains regulations applicable to all signs in all
zoning districts within the city, subject to any exceptions as may be
authorized for preexisting signs governed by the regulations set forth in §§
157.075 through
157.084.
      (2)   These regulations are supplemented and qualified by the regulations
of the particular zoning district in which a sign may be located and by
additional general regulations appearing elsewhere in this chapter.
      (3)   Regulations for any signs may be made more or less restrictive in
the conditions of the ordinance governing a particular Planned Use District.
      (4)   The requirements of this subchapter may be modified as part of any
Planned Development District Ordinance where alternative materials, design or
types of signage are proposed that meet or exceed the quality and other
purposes of this chapter.
      (5)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to prohibit lawful non-
commercial speech on a signage otherwise specifically authorized or designated
for commercial purposes.
   (C)   Interpretation. Every provision of this subchapter shall be construed
liberally in favor of the authority of the city to the extent permissible by
applicable law. Nothing herein shall be construed to be applied or enforced
contrary to any superseding applicable law.
(Prior Code, § 158.160) (Ord. 623, passed 9-8-1970; Ord. 3786, passed 12-17-

§ 157.161 SIGN PERMIT REQUIRED; ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Enforcement officer duties. The Director and his or her designee are
authorized to administer and enforce the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Sign permits. Unless subject to an exception set forth in this
subchapter, no sign shall be erected, constructed, posted, altered, enlarged or
relocated until a sign permit has been issued by the Director.
      (1)   Before any zoning authorization is issued, an application shall be
filed, together with drawings and specifications as may be necessary to fully
advise and acquaint the Director with the location, construction, materials,
manner of illuminating and securing or fastening of, and the wording or
delineation to be carried on, any sign. All signs that are to be illuminated by
one or more sources of artificial light shall require a separate electrical
permit and/or inspection unless work is performed as part of a current,

         (b)   Seasonal displays failing to meet these qualifications shall not
be exempt.
   (C)   Materials; location.
      (1)   (a)   All signs, including its sign face, cabinet, structure, trim,

resistant materials appropriate for permanent sign construction. Permanent
signs shall not be of a fabric material or banner, except in the case of
awnings.
         (b)   Signs not kept in good repair and appearance are hereby declared
prohibited and a nuisance. The Director shall be authorized to establish
prohibited materials and other regulations relating to acceptable sign
components and construction consistent with this subchapter.
      (2)   All signs shall be located so as not to impair the visibility of
any official highway sign or marker and no non-governmental sign shall be
placed so as to unnecessarily obstruct the visibility of any other sign.
      (3)   Signs may not be placed on any private or public property without
the consent of the owner or person having authority to grant consent to use the

allowed.
   (E)   Calculation of sign area. The area of every sign shall be calculated

establishment has frontage on two or more streets, each side of the property
having frontage shall be considered separately for determining the permitted
total sign face area and number of allowable signs, unless otherwise governed
by this subchapter. However, the sign area allowances shall not be aggregated
so as to allow any establishment to display on any frontage a greater sign face
area than that single frontage would otherwise permit.
      (6)   Exceptions. The total sign area for any freestanding signs shall be
exclusive of any decorative trim, frame and/or structure. Said trim, frame and/
or structure shall not exceed 30% of the sign area as determined in accordance

of-way or on to adjoining properties in any residential or agricultural
district.

      (1)   Every sign shall be designed and constructed in conformity with the
applicable provisions of the current adopted Building Code of the city. Where
sections in the Building Code conflict herewith, this subchapter shall apply.
      (2)   The electrical component of any illuminated sign shall conform to
the applicable requirements of the current N.E.C. Electrical Code of the city.
   (K)   Setback calculation. Calculation of the setbacks for signs as

the sole or joint supports for such freestanding sign shall be a minimum of
one-third the width of the widest part of the sign. In lieu of a required base,
the Department may approve a landscaped or otherwise appropriately designed
ornamental or architectural feature concealing the base of the supports.

building that was designed for and originally used as a residential dwelling
unit, and which exterior structure has not been substantially altered to
conform it to a commercial building, shall be limited by the additional

§ 157.188 MODIFICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   Upon request by the applicant, the City Council may consider and
approve alternatives to full compliance with the landscaping, screening and
buffering standards contained in this subchapter if the associated visual
impact is mitigated to the maximum extent feasible by the alternative
landscaping and screening plans. Mitigation measures may include, but are not
limited to, increased setbacks, increased landscaping, additional fencing and
architectural treatments or otherwise camouflaging equipment or, with prior
City Council approval, the planting and maintenance, or payment therefor, of
adjacent public way landscaping.
   (B)   The Director may waive a buffer requirement or reduce its extent to a
temporarily appropriate level of screening if the future land use map
designates adjoining property in a land use category such that a buffer would
not be required by this chapter once the adjoining property is rezoned or
developed.
(Prior Code, § 158.188) (Ord. 3474, passed 9-5-2006)
§ 157.189 INSTALLATION.
   All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the “American Standard
for Nursery Stock”, published by the American Association for Nurserymen and is
hereby incorporated by reference. All landscaping shall be installed prior to
issuance of any temporary or final occupancy permit, unless a hardship is
determined to exist by the Director. In such event, the landscaping
improvements shall be secured with a letter of credit or other acceptable
surety pursuant to §
157.058.
(Prior Code, § 158.189) (Ord. 3474, passed 9-5-2006)
§ 157.190 MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   The applicant, developer, landowner and successors in interest shall
be jointly and severally responsible for the regular maintenance of all
landscaping elements, whether located on private common ground or private
property, in accordance with the approved landscaping plan. Trees and
vegetation, irrigation systems, fences, walls and other landscape elements
shall be considered required elements of a development in the same manner as
parking, building materials and other site requirements imposed by the final
development plan or otherwise. When a buffer is required, the owner shall
maintain the landscaping and screening to provide an opaque visual screen to a
height of six feet on a continuous, year-round basis. All landscaping shall be
maintained free of disease, pests, weeds and litter. All landscape structures,
such as fences, walls and planters, shall be repaired and replaced periodically
to maintain them in a structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing condition.
   (B)   (1)   All property owners shall be responsible to maintain and keep
safe and free from debris and yard waste the landscaped parkway adjacent to
such property. Any landscape element located on the owner’s property that dies,
or is otherwise removed or seriously damaged, shall, within 30 days of the
beginning of the growing season, be replaced based on the requirement of this
subchapter.
      (2)   If the owner fails to fulfill his or her obligation in this regard
during an 18-month period after installation of the landscaping, the city may
complete the performance and seek reimbursement from the owner’s surety.
(Prior Code, § 158.190) (Ord. 3474, passed 9-5-2006)
§ 157.191 LANDSCAPE CREDIT.
   Any existing trees on a site that are in appropriate locations and of
acceptable quality may be credited towards fulfillment of any landscaping
provisions of this chapter on a caliper inch-per-inch basis, at the discretion
of the city.
(Prior Code, § 158.191) (Ord. 3474, passed 9-5-2006)
§ 157.192 CONSTRUCTION PROTECTION.
   The following standards shall be followed prior to and during construction
to protect significant trees.
   (A)   Within the drip line of any protected tree, there shall be no cut or
fill unless the disturbance has been evaluated and approved by an independent
arborist, urban forester, landscape architect or other certified professional
as approved by the Director.
   (B)   Prior to and during construction, temporary barriers shall be erected
around all protected existing trees, or tree stands, with a four-foot fence
outside the drip line or five times the DBH, whichever is greater. There shall
be no storage or movement of equipment, material, debris or fill within the
fenced tree-protection zone. The temporary barriers shall be inspected by a
qualified professional identified in division (A) above prior to disturbance.
(Prior Code, § 158.192) (Ord. 3474, passed 9-5-2006)
§ 157.193 RIPARIAN CORRIDORS.
   (A)   Definition. Riparian corridors are those linear natural landscape
systems, which have economic, biological, ecological or visual values for the
community. Within the city, riparian corridors located along naturally
occurring drainage channels have been identified as critical environmental
resources within the community. These corridors form important visual and
recreational opportunities for the community, which in-turn create economic
value when correctly preserved as amenities within developed parcels.
   (B)   Intent. This section is provided to govern the preservation of all
existing landform/topographic conditions and vegetative cover within identified
environmental corridors. RIPARIAN CORRIDORS, identified in the environmental/
landscape framework plan, are defined as those natural drainage channels having
tree canopy or other vegetative cover, and/or soils generally associated with
continuous or intermittent drainage or flooding. For purposes of the plan,
riparian corridors have been identified by visual means, using current aerial
photographs that indicate tree canopy cover over or within natural drainage
channels.
   (C)   Applicability. This section shall apply to any land disturbance or
construction of any structure within any area designated as a riparian corridor
as set forth in the environmental/landscape framework plan, the boundaries of
which are more specifically set forth in the plan’s map appendix. To the extent
that a parcel is only partially subject to the riparian corridor designation,
only structures or land disturbance on that portion of the site shall be
subject to this section.
   (D)   Procedures. Land disturbance and construction of any structure
governed by this section is prohibited, except as may be specifically permitted
by special use permit issued pursuant to §§
157.240 through
157.243,
157.255 through
157.257,
157.270 through
157.282 and this subchapter, and subject to the additional standards
established in this section. If construction is proposed as part of a planned
use, no separate special use permit is needed.
   (E)   Standards. No special use permit shall be granted pursuant to this
section, except in conformance with the standards established in the
environmental/landscape framework plan, and the standards established in §§
157.095 through
157.102, as applied to the riparian corridor. The issuance of a special use
permit shall require maximum preservation of vegetation and tree canopy, and
shall include mitigation conditions to ensure that any disturbance within the
riparian corridor is minimized and adequately restored and mitigated where
disturbance cannot be reasonably avoided.
   (F)   Requirements. If it is determined that a portion of a riparian
corridor is located on the site of a proposed subdivision or development
proposal, the petitioner shall comply with the following.
      (1)   Site plan. Each applicant must show any riparian areas on the
required site plan. The city may determine the applicability of specific
criteria where existing riparian corridor tree canopy and other vegetative
cover is less than 300 feet in width.
      (2)   Clearing restrictions. In no case may existing trees or other
vegetation be removed within riparian corridors identified as part of a
submitted site plan without prior written approval by the city. Such review and
approval by the city is required in order to maintain a citywide functional
stormwater management system and important environmental functions of these
areas.
   (G)   Riparian corridor “x” zone. The “x” zone of the riparian corridor is a
critical zone of vegetative cover and soil conditions that provides for
drainage channel bank stability and erosion control. Current tree canopy along
most of the identified riparian corridors occurs within the width of the “x”
zone, and in addition to the erosion control created by the vegetation within
the zone, the zone creates primary wildlife habitat and movement corridors. The
zone’s tree canopy, a remnant of the forests which covered much of the city’s
landscape prior to agricultural use and development, creates important visual
qualities for the city. Development and preservation criteria for the “x” zone
include:
      (1)   A minimum width of 300 feet, measured 150 feet (horizontal or plan
dimension) perpendicular from centerline of drainage channel on both slopes;
      (2)   Development of parcels shall not directly or indirectly impact the
“x” zone area of the riparian corridors;
      (3)   All vegetative cover and landform/ topographic conditions must be
retained in a natural condition during development and post-development
activities;
      (4)   Stormwater management basins, devices or strategies shall not be
deployed within the “x” zone of the riparian corridor unless other stormwater
mitigation strategies are deemed impractical by the city; and
      (5)   Use of the “x” zone shall be primarily resource preservation.
Limited use of the zone for hike and bike trails may be approved by the city.
   (H)   Riparian corridor “y” zone. The “y” zone of the riparian corridor is
another critical zone of vegetative cover and soil conditions that shall be
preserved or re-established outside of the “x” zone described above. The
primary purpose of the “y” zone is to provide additional biological filtration
of sediment and contaminants carried by stormwater runoff into natural drainage
channels, and to further buffer or slow stormwater time of concentration as
storm flows enter natural drainage channels. Development and preservation
criteria for the “y” zone include:
      (1)   Minimum width of 50 feet, measured 50 feet (horizontal or plan
dimension) perpendicular from outside boundary of “x” zone as described above;
      (2)   Development of parcels shall not directly or indirectly impact the
“y” zone area of the riparian corridors, except for uses noted below.
Otherwise, all vegetative cover and landform/ topographic conditions must be
retained in a natural condition during development and post-development;
      (3)   Use of the “y” zone shall be limited to non-structural or natural
stormwater management strategies, non-vehicular circulation systems or
dedicated parkland/open space developed with native plant species; and
      (4)   Stormwater management basins, devices or strategies deployed within
the “y” zone shall be reviewed and approved by the city.

   (I)   Alternative compliance. Upon request by the applicant, the Director
may consider and approve alternatives to full compliance with the development
guidelines contained in this subchapter if the associated environmental and
functional impact of the environmental corridor is mitigated to the maximum
extent feasible by the alternative methods. Any proposed alternatives must be
shown on the site plan and certified by a qualified professional knowledgeable
in the area of natural drainage systems.

build or modify antennas or support structures. Additional measures may be
required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit or administrative
permit as deemed necessary by the Director or by the Planning Commission in the
case of a special use permit.
   (E)   Lighting. Antennas and support structures shall not be lighted unless
required by the FAA or other state or federal agency with authority to
regulate, in which case a description of the required lighting scheme will be
made a part of the application to install, build or modify the antennas or
support structure. Equipment cabinets and shelters may have lighting only as
approved by the Director on the approved site development plan.
   (F)   Advertising. Except for a disguised antenna support structure in the
form of an otherwise lawfully permitted pylon sign, the placement of
advertising on structures regulated by this section is prohibited.
   (G)   Design.
      (1)   Subject to the requirements of the FAA or any applicable state or
federal agency, towers shall be painted a neutral color consistent with the
natural or built environment of the site.
      (2)   Equipment shelters or cabinets shall have an exterior finish
compatible with the natural or built environment of the site and shall also
comply with any design guidelines as may be applicable to the particular zoning
district in which the facility is located.
      (3)   Towers shall not exceed the height limitation of any airport
overlay zone as may be adopted by the city.
      (4)   Antennas attached to a building or disguised antenna support
structure shall be of a color identical to or closely compatible with the
surface to which they are mounted. All other antennas shall be designed
disguised, or if otherwise permitted, maximally concealed on or within the
support structure. Unless demonstrated to be technologically unfeasible,
exposed or separated antennas on “crows nest” platforms are prohibited.
      (5)   All towers shall be surrounded by a minimum six-foot high
decorative wall constructed of brick, stone or comparable masonry materials and
a landscape strip of not less than ten feet in width and planted with
materials, which will provide a visual barrier to a minimum height of six feet.
The landscape strip shall be exterior to any security wall. In lieu of the
required wall and landscape strip, an alternative means of screening may be
approved by the Director in the case of use permitted by administrative permit,
or by the Planning Commission in the case of a special use permit, upon
demonstration by the applicant that an equivalent degree of visual screening
will be achieved.
      (6)   All towers, disguised support structures and related structures,
fences and walls shall be separated from the property line of any adjacent
property zoned for a residential use at least a distance equal to the height of
the tower, and shall be separated from all other adjacent property lines at
least a distance equal to one-half of the height of the tower or structure.
      (7)   Vehicle or outdoor storage on any tower site is prohibited, unless
otherwise permitted by the zoning.
      (8)   On-site parking for periodic maintenance and service shall be
provided at all antenna or tower locations consistent with the underlying
zoning district.
   (H)   Shared use.
      (1)   Existing towers. Prior to the issuance of any permit to alter or
modify any tower existing on the effective date of this subchapter, the owner
shall provide to the city a written and notarized agreement committing to make
said tower available for use by others subject to reasonable technical
limitations and reasonable financial terms. The willful and knowing failure of
a tower owner to agree to shared use or to negotiate in good faith with
potential users shall be unlawful and shall, among other remedies of the city,
be cause for the withholding of future permits to the same owner to install,
build or modify antennas or towers within the city.
      (2)   Tower inventories. Prior to the issuance of any permit to install,
build or modify any tower, the tower owner shall furnish the Director an
inventory of all of that owner’s towers in or within one and one-half miles of
the city limits. The inventory shall include the tower’s reference name or
number, the street location, latitude and longitude, structure type, height,
type and mounting height of existing antennas and an assessment of available
ground space for the placement of additional equipment shelters. Upon being
modified, any such tower shall be placed on the multi-use interest area map for
required collocation.
      (3)   Shared use required; new towers. Any new tower approved at a height
of 60 feet AGL (above ground level) or higher shall be designed and constructed
to accommodate at least one additional user unless a larger number is indicated
by the response to the notification provisions herein. A written agreement
committing to shared use as required by division (H)(1) above shall be
submitted by the tower applicant. The willful and knowing failure of the owner
of a tower built for shared use to negotiate in good faith with potential users
shall be unlawful and shall be a violation of this subchapter and, among other
remedies of the city, shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to
the same owner to install, build or modify antennas or towers within the city.
      (4)   Communications tower multi-use area map. Any new tower approved
within a communication tower multi-use interest area as designated by the map
of the same title shall be designed and constructed to accommodate the number
of users indicated by the plan to the extent feasible. The willful and knowing
failure of the owner of a tower build for shared use to negotiate in good faith
with potential users shall be a violation of this subchapter and, among other
remedies of the city, shall be cause for the withholding of future permits to
the same owner to install, build or modify antennas or towers within the city.
      (5)   Notice of tower applications to potential tower users. Prior to any
application for the construction of a new tower or disguised support structure,
a copy of the application or a summary containing the height, design, location
and type and frequency of antennas shall be delivered by certified mail to all
known potential tower users as identified by a schedule maintained by the
Community Development Department. Proof of such delivery shall be submitted
with the application to the city. The Director may establish a form required to
be used for such notifications. Upon request, the Director shall place on a
list the name and address of any user of towers or prospective user to receive
notification of applications. The Director shall, before deciding on the
application or forwarding it to the Planning Commission for consideration,
allow all persons receiving notice at least ten business days to respond to the
city and the applicant that the party receiving notice be permitted to share
the proposed tower or locate within one mile of such area. Where two or more
parties seek to locate within one mile of each other, or such other distance as
is demonstrated to the Director to be reasonable pursuant to the objectives of
this subchapter, the Director shall designate such area as a multi-use interest
area on the map. The failure of the receiving party to use this process or
respond to any such notice shall be considered cause for denying requests by
such party for new towers or structures.
      (6)   Appeal of shared use violations. Any party seeking shared use of a
tower subject to this provision shall after responding to notice of an
application, negotiate with the applicant for such use. The applicant may, on a
legitimate and reasonable business basis, choose between multiple requests for
shared use on the same tower or structure, and may reject any request where
legitimate technical obstacles cannot be reasonably overcome or where the party
requesting shared use will not agree to reasonable financial terms. Any party
believing that the applicant has breached its duty to negotiate in good faith
for shared use shall immediately notify the applicant and the Director in
writing. The Director may reject the application upon a finding that shared use
has been improperly denied. A notice of breach of duty shall explain the
precise basis for the claim and shall be accompanied by payment of an
administrative review fee of $500 to the city to offset the cost of review.
After the applicant’s receipt of the notice, the applicant shall have ten
calendar days to provide a written submission to the Director responding to the
alleged violation of the shared use requirement. If deemed necessary by the
Director, he or she may engage, at the cost of the party alleging the
violation, a neutral, qualified technical consultant to provide an opinion on
feasibility or costs of the shared use request. If the Director receives a
notice alleging a violation of the shared use requirement, the time for a
decision on an administrative permit is automatically extended for up to 30
days until the Director has determined that the applicant has complied. An
application for special use permit shall not be deemed complete for acceptance
until a decision on compliance is reached.
   (I)   Construction of telecommunication facilities within one and one-half
miles of the city. Except to the extent contrary to applicable law, a telecom-
munications carrier or other entity shall, prior to constructing a
telecommunications facility within one and one-half miles of the city, comply
with the following requirements.
      (1)   Notice.
         (a)   Pursuant to 65 ILCS 5/11-13-1, at least 30 days prior to
commencing construction of a new telecommunications facility, the telecomm-
unications carrier shall provide written notice of its intent to construct the
facility. The notice shall include, but not be limited to, the following
information:
            1.   The name, address and telephone number of the company
responsible for the construction of the facility; and
            2.   The address and telephone number of the governmental entity
that issued the building permit for the telecommunications facility.
         (b)   The notice shall be provided in person, by overnight private
courier or by certified mail to the city and all owners of property within 250
feet of the parcel in which the telecommunications carrier has a leasehold or
ownership interest.
         (c)   For the purposes of this notice requirement, OWNERS means those
persons or entities identified from the authentic tax records of the county in
which the telecommunications facility is to be located. If, after a bona fide
effort by the telecommunications carrier to determine the owner and his or her
address, the owner of the property on whom the notice must be served cannot be
found at the owner’s last known address, or if the mailed notice is returned
because the owner cannot be found at the last known address, the notice
requirement of this division (I)(1) is deemed satisfied.
      (2)   Subdivision and development regulations. No such construction shall
commence contrary to any provision of the subdivision and development control
ordinance and any required approval therein, including, but not limited to, any
grading or infrastructure permit approval.

(Prior Code, § 158.209) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.210 AUTHORIZATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE PERMIT.
   (A)   The placement of antenna and towers are permitted in all zoning
districts by administrative permit approved by the Director only as follows:
      (1)   The attachment of additional or replacement antennas or shelters to
any tower existing on the effective date of this subchapter or subsequently
approved in accordance with these regulations and requiring the enlargement of
the existing tower compound area as long as all other requirements of this
section and the underlying zoning district are met;
      (2)   The one-time replacement of any tower existing on the effective
date of this subchapter or subsequently approved in accordance with these
regulations so long as the purpose of the replacement is to accommodate shared
use of the site or to eliminate a safety hazard. The new tower shall be of the
same type as the original except that a guyed or self-supporting (lattice)
tower may be replaced by a monopole. If the guyed or lattice tower to be
replaced is 180 feet or less in height, it shall only be replaced with a
monopole. The height of the new tower may exceed that of the original by not
more than 20 feet. Subsequent replacements shall require the approval of a
special use permit;
      (3)   The construction of a disguised support structure; provided that
all related equipment shall be placed underground or concealed within the
structure when the structure is located in any district other than a district
authorizing industrial uses. Equipment may be placed in a cabinet if the
disguised support structure is incidental to an industrial, commercial,
institutional or other non-residential use;
      (4)   The placement of dual polar panel antennas on wooden or steel
functioning utility poles not to exceed 40 feet in height in any residentially
zoned district and on any such poles (or functional replacement poles of no
greater height) existing in any other district on the date of adoption of this
subchapter. All related equipment for antennas permitted by this division (A)
(4) shall be wholly contained in a cabinet; and
      (5)   Towers erected and maintained for a period not to exceed 45 days
for the purpose of replacing an existing tower, testing an existing or proposed
network or special events requiring mobile towers.
   (B)   Applications for administrative permits shall be made on the
appropriate forms to the Director and accompanied by payment of $500, or such
other fee as may be established by the Council.
   (C)   A detailed site plan, based on a closed boundary survey of the host
parcel, shall be submitted indicating all existing and proposed improvements
including buildings, drives, walkway, parking areas and other structures,
public right-of-way, the zoning categories of the subject and adjoining
properties, the location of and distance to off-site residential structures,
required setbacks, required buffer and landscape areas, hydrologic features and
the coordinates and height AGL of the existing or proposed tower.

compliance with the above standards and transmit the application for review and
comment by other departments and public agencies as may be affected by the
proposed facility.
   (E)   The Director shall issue a decision on the permit within 45 days of
the date of application or the application shall be deemed approved unless the
time period for review and action was extended. The Director may deny the
application or approve the application as submitted or with such modifications
as are, in his or her judgment, reasonably necessary to protect the safety or
general welfare of the citizens consistent with the purposes of this section.
The Director may consider the purposes of this section and the factors
established herein for granting a special use permit as well as any other
considerations consistent with this subchapter. A decision to deny an
application shall be made in writing and state the specific reasons for the
denial.
   (F)   Appeals from the decision of the Director shall be made in the same
manner as otherwise provided for the appeal of administrative decisions.
(Prior Code, § 158.210) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.211 SPECIAL USE PERMIT REQUIRED.
   All proposals to install, build or modify an antenna or support structure
not permitted by §§
157.209 and
157.210 shall require the approval of special use permit following a duly
advertised public hearing by the Planning Commission, subject to the
forthcoming limitations.
   (A)   Applications. Applications of special use permits shall be filed and
processed subject to the requirements of and in the manner and time frame as
established in §§
157.240 through
157.242,
157.255 through
157.257 and
157.270 through
157.282. A decision by the Planning Commission shall be accompanied by
substantial evidence supporting the decision, which shall be made a part of the
written record of the meeting at which a final decision on the application is
rendered. Evidence shall be under oath and may be submitted with the
application or thereafter or presented during the public hearing by the
applicant or others.
   (B)   Additional minimum requirements. No special use permit shall be issued
unless the applicant has clearly demonstrated by substantial evidence that
placement of an antenna or support structure pursuant to §§
157.209 and
157.210 is not technologically or economically feasible. The Planning
Commission may consider current or emerging industry standards and practices,
among other information, in determining feasibility.
   (C)   Findings required. In addition to the determinations or limitations
specified herein and by §§
157.095 through
157.102 for the consideration of special use permits, the Planning Commission
shall also base its decision upon, and shall make findings as to, the existence
of the following conditions:
      (1)   The proposed tower is not and cannot be located within a
communications tower multi-use interest area as designated by such map, or if
so located, meets the co-location requirements of this section;
      (2)   No existing towers, structures or buildings within the necessary
geographic area for the applicant’s tower meet the applicant’s necessary
engineering requirements considering:
         (a)   Height;
         (b)   Structural strength;
         (c)   Resulting signal interference;
         (d)   Feasibility of retrofitting;
         (e)   Feasibility of redesigning the applicant’s tower network; or
         (f)   Other limiting conditions that render towers, structures or
buildings within the applicant’s required geographic area unsuitable.
      (3)   Applications for a new tower structure shall be considered only
after a letter, certified by a radio frequency engineer, clearly demonstrates
that the planned telecommunications equipment cannot be accommodated on an
existing or approved transmission tower and clearly demonstrates one or more of
the following conditions:
         (a)   Planned telecommunications equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of an existing or approved transmission tower, and the transmission
tower cannot be reinforced to accommodate planned telecommunication equipment
at a reasonable cost;
         (b)   Planned telecommunications equipment will cause radio frequency
interference with other existing or planned telecommunications equipment for
that transmission tower and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost;
         (c)   Existing or approved towers do not have space on which the
planned telecommunications equipment can be placed so it can function
effectively and at least in parity with other similar telecommunications
equipment in place or approved by the city and or the county.
         (d)   Addition of planned equipment to an existing or approved
transmission tower would result in NIER levels in excess or those permitted
under division (C)(5) below; or
         (e)   Other reasons that make it impractical to place the
telecommunications equipment planned by the applicant on an existing and
approved transmission tower.
      (4)   No application for a new tower structure shall be considered unless
the applicant is unable to lease or otherwise secure space on an existing or
planned telecommunication tower.
         (a)   Shared use of an existing or approved tower shall be conditioned
upon the applicant’s agreement to pay reasonable fees and costs associated with
adapting existing facilities to the proposed use, including, but not limited
to, reasonable costs for reinforcing or modifying a tower or structure, for
preventing radio frequency interferences and other changes reasonably required
to accommodate shared use.
         (b)   The city may consider expert testimony to determine whether the
fees and costs are reasonable.
         (c)   Once the city finds that the telecommunications equipment
proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved
tower, each tower so found is presumed unable to accommodate similar equipment
that may be proposed in the future, unless evidence is introduced to
demonstrate otherwise.
      (5)   The design of the tower or structure, including the antennas,
shelter and ground layout maximally reduces visual degradation and otherwise
complies with provisions and intent of this section. New towers shall be of a
monopole design, unless it is shown that an alternative design would equally or
better satisfy this division (C)(5);
      (6)   The proposal minimizes the number and/or size of towers or
structures that will be required in the area. Where alternate technology or
design exists or is reasonably available that would satisfy the general need
for the proposal, this factor is ordinarily not satisfied;
      (7)   The applicant has not previously failed to take advantage of
reasonably available shared use opportunities or procedures provided by this
subchapter or otherwise;
      (8)   No land owned by any agency of the federal or state government, or
by any political subdivision of the state, is available for locating the
structure or tower;
      (9)   The city may require, at the expense of the petitioner, any
additional studies or the hiring of an external consultant to review exhibits
and/or other requirements in accordance with this section; and
      (10)   If any one, but not more than one, of the first six determinations
is not satisfied, approval may be granted only on a finding of unique
circumstances otherwise necessitating approval to satisfy the purposes of this
section.
   (D)   Additional height limitations. No tower shall be approved at a height
exceeding 150 feet AGL unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that such
height is required for the proper function of the applicant’s system or that of
a public safety communications system of a governmental entity sharing the
tower. Such showing must also be supported by the opinion of a
telecommunications consultant hired by the city at the expense of the
applicant. The opinion of the consultant shall include a statement that no
available alternatives exist to exceeding the height limit or the reason why
such alternatives are not viable.
   (E)   Non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation standards. All transmission
facilities shall conform to the relevant sections of the “American National
Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic
Fields, 300 kHz to 100 kHz”. This standard as identified by as ANSI-C95.1-1982
and is published by the American National Standards Institute, a copy of which
is incorporated herein by reference and is maintained on file in the office of
the Director of Community Development.
(Prior Code, § 158.211) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.212 OBSOLETE NON-COMPLYING TOWER STRUCTURES.
   Any upper portion of a tower which is not occupied by active antennas for a
period of 12 months, and any entire tower which is not so occupied for a period
of six months, shall be removed at the owner’s expense. Removal of upper
portions of a tower manufactured as a single unit shall not be required.
Failure to comply with this provision shall constitute a nuisance that may be
remedied by the city at the tower or property owner’s expense. Any applicant
for a new tower or disguised structure not built as disguised part of another
existing or permitted structure shall place a bond or other security with the
city prior to any final approval for the purpose of removing any tower or
disguised structure as required herein and to compensate the city for
performing proper maintenance of such towers or disguised structures to ensure
such structures do not become unsafe or otherwise fail to be maintained in
compliance with this subchapter. The bond or security shall be in the form
approved by the Director, and in the amount of $15,000, or such other amount as
is determined by the Director to satisfy the requirements hereof with regard to
the specific tower or structure to which it would apply.
(Prior Code, § 158.212) (Ord. 3399, passed 12-5-2005)
§ 157.213 COMMERCIAL OPERATION OF UNLAWFUL TOWER OR ANTENNAS.
   Notwithstanding any right that may exist for a governmental entity to
operate or construct a tower or structure, it shall be unlawful for any person
to erect or operate for any private commercial purpose of any antenna, tower or
disguised support structure in violation of any provision of this subchapter,
regardless of whether such antenna or structure is located on land owned by a
governmental entity.

ZONING AMENDMENTS
§ 157.240 WHO MAY APPLY.

be filed by the governing body, the City Administrator or the Director. A
“zoning text amendment” is any amendment to the city’s Zoning Code herein, but
does not include the property rezoning.
   (B)   Property rezoning. An application for property rezoning may be filed
by either the City Administrator, at the direction of the governing body, the
landowner or the landowner’s agent. A “property rezoning” is a zoning district
change or a planned use amendment applicable to one or more specific properties

Consideration of zoning text amendments shall require a public hearing before
the Commission following publication notice in accordance with requirements set
forth in §§
157.255 through
157.257. The recommendation of the Commission is advisory.
   (B)   A vote either for or against a zoning text amendment by a majority of
all of the Commissioners present shall constitute a recommendation of the
Commission. If a motion for or against the zoning text amendment fails to
receive a majority vote, the Commission may entertain a new motion. A tie vote,
or the failure to obtain a majority vote on any motion, shall constitute a
“failure to recommend”. The Commission’s recommendation, or failure to
recommend, shall be submitted to the governing body, accompanied by a written
summary of the hearing.
   (C)   When the Commission submits a recommendation to the governing body,
the governing body may take such action as it deems appropriate, including
approval, approval with conditions, disapproval, amendment of the application
and adoption as amended or rehearing of the petition by the governing body.
(Prior Code, § 158.241) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)

property rezoning shall require a public hearing before the Commission and
governing body, with publication notice, notice to surrounding property owners
as required by §§
157.255 through
157.257.
   (B)   Procedures. The procedures for Commission and governing body
consideration of property rezoning applications shall conform to the procedures
set forth for zoning text amendments. The governing body shall not take action
on the Commission’s original recommendation or a failure to recommend unless
seven days have elapsed after the date of the conclusion of the Commission’s
public hearing held pursuant to publication notice to allow the filing of a
protest petition as provided in this section. However, where the right to file
a protest petition has been waived in a verified statement signed by all
property owners holding the right, the governing body may consider the
Commission’s recommendation at any time.
   (C)   Protest petitions.
      (1)   A protest against any property rezoning application shall be filed
not later than the end of the business day (5:00 p.m.) on the seventh day
following the date of the conclusion of the Commission’s public hearing held
pursuant to the publication notice. To be considered a valid protest, a protest
petition must be timely filed and duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of
20% of the frontage proposed to be altered, or by the owners of 20% of the
frontage immediately adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners
of 20% of the frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered.
      (2)   If a protest is filed, a copy of the written protest shall be
served by the protestor or protestors on the applicant for the proposed
amendments and a copy upon the applicant’s attorney, if any, by certified mail
at the address of the applicant and attorney shown in the application for the
proposed amendment. Verification of the genuineness and correctness of the
signatures on the protest petition, either individually or collectively, shall
be made by a person who has signed the protest petition.
      (3)   Once a valid protest petition has been filed with the city, it may
not be withdrawn unless every person who originally signed the protest signs a
verified affidavit that states and fully explains the rights being waived by
the withdrawal of the protest petition. The affidavits of withdrawal must be
filed with the City Clerk on or before the last regular business day preceding
the governing body meeting for which the protest applies. For purposes of
withdrawal, signatures shall not be required of the city, where city-owned
property lies within the protest area, or of entities controlling rights-of-way
or utility easements.
   (D)   Adoption where protest filed. Where a valid protest petition has been
filed, an ordinance approving the property rezoning shall not become effective,
except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all members of the governing
body.
   (E)   Criteria for considering applications. In considering any application
for rezoning, the Commission and the governing body may give consideration to
the criteria stated below to the extent they are pertinent to the particular
application. The Commission and governing body also may consider other factors
that may be relevant to a particular application:
      (1)   The existing uses and zoning of nearby property;
      (2)   The extent to which property values are diminished by the
particular zoning restrictions;
      (3)   The extent to which the destruction of property values of plaintiff
promote the health, safety, morals or welfare of the public;
      (4)   The relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed
upon the individual property owner;
      (5)   The suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes;
      (6)   The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered
in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the subject
property;
      (7)   The care that the community has taken to plan its land use
development; and
      (8)   The community need for the proposed use.
(Prior Code, § 158.242) (Ord. 3382, passed 11-7-2005)
§ 157.243 LIMITATION ON SUCCESSIVE PROPERTY REZONING APPLICATIONS BY LANDOWNER.

filed and advertised for public hearing within the preceding 12 months.
   (B)   For purposes of division (A) above, the preceding 12-month period
shall be determined as follows.

recommendation thereon to the City Council, consistent with 65 ILCS 5/11-13-

adopt any proposed use variance, or the Council may refer it back to the
hearing officer for further consideration or deny the use variance request as a
final action. For purposes of this section, USE VARIANCES shall be any
variation that authorizes any use or classification of use to continue or
commence in a zoning district in which that use is not a permitted use by

hearing officer shall not be approved, except by the favorable vote of two-
thirds of all Council members. No variance shall be granted that shall
authorize a use that may be granted by special use or planned use procedures.
      (2)   Use variances are not favored and shall be granted only when
failure to authorize the use denies all economically viable use of the property
or similar extreme hardship is demonstrated by the evidence presented.

pursuant to this chapter, or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the
city relating to such decision. The appeal shall be taken within 45 days of the
action complained of by filing, with the officer from whom the appeal is taken
and with the hearing officer a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds
thereof. The official appealed from shall thereupon transmit to the hearing
officer all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
   (B)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the official appealed from certifies to the hearing
officer after the notice of appeal has been filed with him or her that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, the stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause eminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted
by the hearing officer or by a court of record on application, or notice to the
official appealed from and on due cause shown.
   (C)   The hearing officer may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may
modify or amend the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from
to the extent and in the manner that the hearing officer may decide to be
fitting and proper to the premises. No challenge to any decision subject to
this section shall filed in any court until or unless a timely appeal has been
filed and prosecuted to completion by the applicant as provided for in this
subchapter so as to establish a final appealable decision.

where there are practical difficulties or particular hardship in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of any regulation of this chapter relating to
the use, construction, alteration of buildings or structures or the use of
land, but in no other case.
   (B)   No variance may be granted to any condition or term of a special use
permit or planned zoning procedure. The hearing officer may impose such
conditions, safeguards and restrictions upon the premises, benefitted by the

AIRPORT OVERLAY BOUNDARIES AND MAPS
§ 157.335 AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   Certain airport environs are identified and established by this chapter for
property within and around Scott Air Force Base (“AFB”) and MidAmerica St.
Louis Airport (MidAmerica) within the county. These environs have been
identified through “Federal Aviation Regulations” 14 C.F.R. pt. 77 and data
provided to St. Clair County by the United States Air Force as part of the
“2008 Joint Land Use Study” and the “2009 Air Installation Compatible Use Zone
(AICUZ) Report”. Areas within the airport environs are subject to regulation
beyond the other requirements of this chapter. These additional restrictions,
designated as the Airport Overlay (“AO”) District, provide an enhanced level of
protection in support of the continued operations of Scott AFB and MidAmerica
St. Louis Airport.
(Prior Code, § 158.335) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.336 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Establishment and interpretation of district boundaries. The
boundaries of the Airport Overlay (“AO”) District and sub-area districts are
hereby enacted and established as set forth on the series of four maps
incorporated in §
157.338 (district maps), with precise boundaries being determined by scaling
distances and features shown on these maps. Where interpretation is needed as
to the exact location of the boundaries of the airport districts, as shown on
the Airport Overlay (“AO”) District maps, the Director shall make the necessary
determination of the boundary based on the purposes of this chapter and
underlying mapping data. Any property owner contesting the location of a
district boundary affecting his or her property shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present their case in accordance with the appeal procedures
established in this chapter. The adopted district maps may include areas
outside the territorial boundaries of the city in order to promote coordination
with other participating local governments. The regulations of this Airport
Overlay District shall not be deemed to extend to any property outside such
territorial boundaries to which the city lacks jurisdiction to impose such
regulation.
   (B)   Split parcels. For purposes of regulation of parcels that appear split
by the district boundary lines, only that portion of a parcel that falls within
the district shall be subject to the provisions and standards of this chapter.
   (C)   Boundary changes. The boundaries of the Airport Overlay (“AO”)
District may be subject to change reflecting new military mission activity and/
or aviation operations at Scott AFB and MidAmerica Airport. Scott AFB and
MidAmerica Airport shall communicate the results of updated analyses of noise
and air safety zones, including AICUZ reports and FAA studies, to affected
local governments. The Director shall notify the Air Force, MidAmerica Airport
and other local governments that have adopted airport zoning regulations in the
environs of Scott Air Force Base and MidAmerica Airport of changes to the
district boundary lines as shown in the maps in §
157.338 to promote the coordinated and consistent application of airport
overlay regulations. Other coordinating local governments may adopt more
stringent regulations than the minimum requirements in this chapter. Boundary
changes to the AO District or sub-area districts shall be adopted pursuant to
the procedures applicable to amendments to this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 158.336) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.337 SUB-AREAS; OVERLAP.
   (A)   To carry out the purpose of this district, the Airport Overlay (“AO”)
District is composed of four overlapping sub-area districts that establish
different levels of restrictions based on airport boundary areas of influence,
safety areas based on hazard zones and structure height regulations and noise
contours as follows. Properties or portions of properties located within
multiple sub-areas shall comply with the standards established for each of
those sub-areas in which the property is located.
   (B)   The areas are as follows.
      (1)   AO-1 Primary Planning Influence Area. The Primary Planning
Influence Area designates the sub-area that primarily includes standards for
avigation easements and lighting as described in §§
157.350 through
157.353.
      (2)   AO-2 Safety Zones Area. The Safety Zones Area designates the sub-
area that primarily includes standards for land use, density and design as
designated in §§
157.365 through
157.367. The boundary of this area is determined by FAA and DoD imaginary
surfaces definitions for military and civilian airfields (Clear Zone, Runway
Protection Zone, Accident Potential Zone 1 and Accident Potential Zone 2) in
effect on the effective date of this chapter in conjunction with any other
relevant safety area data obtained by the Director.
      (3)   AO-3 Height Restriction Area. The Height Restriction Area
designates the sub-area that primarily includes standards for controlling
height as described in §§
157.380 through
157.383. The boundary of this area is determined by a combination of
measurements including a 1,500-foot buffer around Scott Air Force Base and
imaginary surfaces definitions for military and civilian airfields in effect on
the effective date of this chapter, in conjunction with any other relevant
height restriction data obtained by the Director.
      (4)   AO-4 Noise Zones Area. The Noise Zones Area designates the sub-area
that primarily includes standards for the attenuation of noise and residential
land use controls as specified in §§
157.395 through
157.398. This boundary is determined by applying the noise contours published
by the DoD for Scott AFB in conjunction with any other relevant noise data
obtained by the Director.
(Prior Code, § 158.337) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.338 MAPS.
   (A)   The following four maps are incorporated as an integral part of this
chapter.
   (B)   These maps are hereby adopted and incorporated as an amendment to the
official zoning map whether maintained separately or integrated within a single
document:
      (1)   AO-1 Primary Planning Influence Area;
      (2)   AO-2 Safety Zones Area;
      (3)   AO-3 Height Restriction Area; and
      (4)   AO-4 Noise Zones Area.

District, be constructed to prevent interference with safe aircraft operation
and to maintain a visually permeable and physically secure buffer that lowers
the vulnerability of personnel on the base to outside attacks.
   (B)   The AO-3 District designates the areas that primarily include
standards for controlling height. Except as otherwise provided herein for this
District, no structure shall be erected, altered or maintained in the AO-
3 District to a height in excess of the applicable height limitations
established in this subchapter or those established and enforced by the FAA,
DoD or IDOT Division of Aeronautics.
   (C)   Establishment of height restriction areas: buildings, structures or
land shall be occupied or used only in conformity with all of the regulations
set forth herein for the district in which they are located. The boundaries of
the AO-3 installation buffer and height hazard restriction areas are shown on

(Prior Code, § 158.397) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.398 ATTENUATION.
   (A)   Minimum noise attenuation requirements and standards. Where a
particular structure contains different occupancy uses, the more stringent
requirements shall apply, except where it is architecturally possible to
achieve the appropriate noise level reduction for each different use and the
uses are acoustically separated by a wall or partition with a minimum STC of
25.
   (B)   Compliance use above minimum. In any instance where noise level
reduction is required by this chapter, all plans and specifications are to be
certified by a recognized acoustical specialist for compliance.
   (C)   Noise reduction.
      (1)   Buildings, structures and active outdoor recreation space shall be
located at the greatest distance from the noise source, taking maximum
advantage of existing topographical features to minimize noise impacts and
within zoning district requirements such as required setbacks.
      (2)   Buildings and structures shall be oriented to minimize exposure to
the noise source and building openings, such as windows, shall be located away
from the noise source. The amount of passive outdoor recreational space where
individuals would be subject to noticeable or severe levels of noise should be
minimized. Landscaping materials should be used to deflect noise. Noise
attenuation shall be accomplished as follows.
         (a)   All mechanical ventilation systems shall provide the minimum air
circulation and fresh air supply requirements as provided in the Building Code
for the proposed occupancy without the need to open any exterior doors or
windows.
         (b)   The perimeter of all exterior windows and door frames shall be
sealed air-tight to the exterior wall construction.
         (c)   Fireplaces shall be equipped with well-fitted chimney cap
devices.
         (d)   All ventilation ducts, except range hoods, connecting interior
space to outdoors shall be provided with a bend such that no direct line of
sight exists from exterior to interior through the vent duct.
         (e)   Doors and windows shall be constructed so they are close-
fitting. Weather- stripping seals shall be incorporated to eliminate all edge
gaps.
         (f)   All penetration through exterior walls by pipes, ducts, conduits
and the like shall be caulked air-tight to the exterior construction.
   (D)   Existing residences. Any existing residence may be added to,
structurally altered or repaired without conforming to the referenced
specifications provided the property owner signs a waiver indicating
notification of said specifications and provided that all generally applicable
requirements of the Building Code are complied with.
(Prior Code, § 158.398) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
AIRPORT OVERLAY SUPPLEMENTAL PROCEDURES
§ 157.410 GENERALLY.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide mechanisms for obtaining
relief from the provisions of this chapter. There are several ways that
potential relief from hardship is addressed, including through non-conforming
development, the grant of a variance, the grant of a special use permit or
through appeal.
   (B)   All cases shall be administered in accordance with the appeal,
variance, non-conforming use and special use permit procedures established in
this chapter; provided that all such procedures shall comply with applicable
procedures set forth in the Airport Zoning Act, 620 ILCS 25/24, 25/27, 25/28
and 25/29.
   (C)   This chapter provides supplemental requirements beyond those required
by applicable state or federal law. The failure of the city to specifically or
precisely conform to any notice, review or other procedural requirement herein
shall not invalidate any action or approval of the city unless such
invalidation is required by law.
   (D)   Avigation easement: as a condition of approval of a development
application in an Airport Overlay (“AO”) District sub-area, including the
application for a variance, rezoning or special use permit prior to receiving
final approval of the application, the applicant may be required to convey to
the appropriate authority an avigation easement consistent with the avigation
easement described in § 
157.352.
(Prior Code, § 158.410) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.411 HEARING OFFICER.
   (A)   The hearing officer established and existing under this chapter is
hereby established as and shall serve as the hearing officer under this
chapter. The hearing officer shall exercise the following powers:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Director in the enforcement of the airport zoning
regulations of this chapter; and
      (2)   To hear and decide specific variances under this chapter.
   (B)   All appeals and variances shall be administered in accordance with the
appeal and variance procedures established in §§
157.295 through
157.301.
(Prior Code, § 158.411) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.412 APPEALS.
   (A)   Except as provided below, appeals shall be made in a manner consistent
with procedures for appeals established within §§
157.295 through
157.301.
   (B)   All appeals must be taken within a reasonable time, as provided in
this chapter, by filing with the Director and with the hearing officer, a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Director shall forthwith
transmit to the hearing officer all the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken.
   (C)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Director certifies to the hearing officer, after the
notice of appeal has been filed with it, that, by reason of the facts stated in
the certificate, a stay would, in the Director’s opinion, cause imminent peril
to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise
than by order of the hearing officer on notice to the Director and on due cause
shown.
   (D)   The hearing officer shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of
appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest and
decide the same within a reasonable time, consistent with the times and
procedures for notice, hearing and decision of appeals provided in this
chapter. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by
attorney.
   (E)   The hearing officer may, in conformity with the provisions of this
chapter and the Airport Zoning Act, 620 ILCS 25/1 et seq., reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or modify, the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination
as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the Director
from which the appeal is taken.
(Prior Code, § 158.412) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.413 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Except as provided herein, variance applications shall be made in a
manner consistent with the procedures for variances established within §§ 
157.295 through
157.301.
   (B)   Any person seeking a variance from the height limitations of this
chapter shall include, as part of their variance application, a determination
from the FAA as to whether the proposed construction or alteration for which
the variance is being sought would be a hazard to air navigation, pursuant to
the standards and procedures set forth in 14 C.F.R. pt. 77.
(Prior Code, § 158.413) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.414 NON-CONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Structures and uses existing on the effective date of this chapter
shall not be required to change in order to comply with these regulations,
except where otherwise required by law or where a threat to public safety
warrants a determination that the ongoing use is a public nuisance. The non-
conforming use requirements of this section shall otherwise apply to the future
applicability of the standards and requirements contained herein; provided that
the requirements of this section shall be supplemented by provisions of this
chapter governing non-conformities which do not conflict with the provisions of
this section.
   (B)   Before any non-conforming structure or object of natural growth may be
replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher or
replanted, a permit must be secured from the Director, authorizing such
replacement, change or repair. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming
structure or tree or non-conforming use to be made or become higher or become a
greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this
chapter or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
   (C)   Whenever the Director determines that a non-conforming use or non-
conforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80% torn down,
destroyed, deteriorated or decayed:
      (1)   No permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree
to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning
regulations; and
      (2)   Whether application is made for a permit under this section or not,
the Director may, by appropriate action, compel the owner of the non-conforming
structure or tree, at his or her own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct or
equip such object as may be necessary to conform to the regulations.
   (D)   If the owner of the non-conforming structure or tree shall neglect or
refuse to comply with such order for ten days after notice thereof, the
Director may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed or
equipped and shall have a lien, upon behalf of the city, upon the land whereon
it is or was located, in the amount of the cost and expense thereof. Such lien
may be enforced by the city by an action for the enforcement thereof, as in the
case of other liens.
(Prior Code, § 158.414) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.415 AIRPORT HAZARD MARKING.
   In granting any development application, the Director or hearing officer
may, if it deems such action advisable to effectuate the purposes of this
chapter and the Airport Zoning Act, 620 ILCS 25/1 et seq., and reasonable in
the circumstances, so condition such grant, consistent with 620 ILCS 25/25, as
to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the state
or the city, as the case may be, at its own expense, to install, operate and
maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to
flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

(Prior Code, § 158.417) (Ord. 3718, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 157.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   (1)   Notice of violation or correction order. If the Zoning Official
determines that a violation of this chapter or regulations made under its
authority has occurred, he or she may issue the violator a civil citation which
shall be proceeded upon in accordance with the provisions herein. The notice or
order shall be issued to the violator by the Zoning Official, which shall
include a notice or summons to answer the charges against him or her within the
time specified on the form for hearing before the Circuit Court. Upon issuance
of a notice or order, the Zoning Official shall provide a copy of the notice or
summons to the Clerk of the Circuit Court bearing jurisdiction.
      (2)   Fines for violations.
         (a)   If the notice of violation or correction order is not complied
with promptly, in addition to other remedies available, the Zoning Official may
request the legal counsel of the city to institute the appropriate proceedings
at law or in equity:
            1.   To prevent the unlawful construction, reconstruction,
alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use;
            2.   To prevent the occupancy of the building, structure or land;
            3.   To prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or
about the premises; or
            4.   To restrain, correct or abate the violation.
         (b)   The owner or general agent of a building or premises where a
violation of any provision of the regulations has been committed or exists, or
the lessee or tenant of an entire building or entire premises where a violation
has been committed or exists, or the owner, general agent, lessee or tenant of
any part of the building or premises in which a violation has been committed or
exists, or the general agent, architect, builder, contractor or any other
person who commits, takes part or assists in any violation or who maintains any
building or premises in which any violation exists shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by a fine in an amount as set by separate ordinance of
the city or other such penalty as determined by the City Attorney or discretion
of the court.
      (3)   Civil lawsuits. The city shall have the authority to maintain civil
suits or actions in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of
enforcing the provisions of this chapter and to abate nuisances maintained in
violation thereof. In the event that any building or structure is or is
proposed to be erected, constructed, altered, converted or maintained in
violation of this chapter, or any building, structure or land is proposed to be
used in violation of this chapter, the City Attorney or other appropriate
authority of the city may, in addition to any other remedies, institute
injunction, mandamus or any other appropriate actions or proceeding to prevent
the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion,
maintenance or use, or to correct or abate the violation, or to prevent the
occupancy of the building, structure or land, or to prevent any illegal act,
conduct, business or use in or about the premises. Attorneys’ fees for the
prosecution of any civil lawsuit pursuant to this section shall be assessed
against the person committing the violation where not prohibited by law.
      (4)   Stop-work order.
         (a)   Issuance.
            1.   In addition to other measures available to cause corrective
action or to restrain the furtherance of work upon or occupancy of any premises
contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or in a manner contrary to the
terms and conditions under which a zoning permit was issued under this chapter,
without need of issuance of a notice of violation or correction order, the
Zoning Official shall have the power and authority to order all work stopped
upon the subject building or structure, or in or about the premises whereon the
violation or other objectionable condition shall occur. Upon the issuance of an
order to stop-work, the work shall be immediately stopped by all persons
involved therewith.
            2.   This stop-work order shall be issued in writing and shall be
presented:
               a.   To the owner of the property involved; or
               b.   To the person doing the work or performing the occupancy.
In the event the stop-work order is rejected or if no responsible person is
present, the order shall be posted on the premises in a conspicuous place.
            3.   The stop-work order shall state:
               a.   The nature of the violation or objectionable condition;
               b.   No work shall precede unless authorized by the Zoning
Official; and
               c.   Shall identify the premises.
         (b)   Observance of stop-work order. Each person who shall continue,
or who shall cause to be continued, any work in or about the building,
structure or premises having been subject to a stop-work order, except to
perform as he or she is directed to perform to correct or abate a violation or
objectionable condition, shall be liable a fine in an amount as set by separate
ordinance of the city.
   (B)   Any person violating §§
157.205 through
157.213 shall be subject to a fine of not more than $500 or 90 days in jail or
both. Each day the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
