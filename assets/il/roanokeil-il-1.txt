employee is specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the
duty. (1974 Code)
1-4-5: ACTION BEFORE PROPER OFFICER:
All actions brought to recover any fine or to enforce any penalty for a
violation of any provision of this code, shall be begun before the proper
officer and shall be brought in the corporate name of the village as plaintiff.
No prosecution, recovery or acquittal for the violation of any code provision
shall constitute a defense to any other prosecution of the same party for any
other violation of such code provision, although the different causes of action
existed at the same time, and, if united, would not have exceeded the
jurisdiction of the court. In addition to the ability to initiate court action,
the village may bring such action to recover any fine or to enforce any penalty
for a violation of any provision of this code through the administrative
process set forth in section
1-4-13 of this chapter. If action taken under section
1-4-13 of this chapter is concluded by the full payment of a fine by the
offender within the specified time period, the village shall not bring any
other action for the specified violation through court proceedings. (Ord. 2002-
15, 8-19-2002)
1-4-6: SUMMONS; WARRANT; COMPLAINT:
In all actions for violation of any code provisions, the first process shall be
summons; and it shall not be necessary to file a complaint in writing prior to
issuing the same; provided however, that a warrant for the arrest of the
offender may issue in the first instance upon the affidavit of any person that
such code provision has been violated, and that the person making the complaint
has reasonable grounds to believe that the person charged is guilty thereof.
Every person arrested upon such warrant shall, without unnecessary delay, be
tried for the alleged offense. However, this section shall not apply if action
is first taken by the village under the administrative process set forth in
section
1-4-13 of this chapter for a violation of this code and properly concluded
under that section. (Ord. 2002-15, 8-19-2002)
1-4-7: CONTENTS OF WARRANT:
All warrants issued by virtue of the foregoing section shall state, or recite
briefly, the allegations of the complaint, and shall be directed to any
constable of Woodford County. The officer receiving such warrant shall
immediately arrest the person against whom the warrant is issued and bring such
person before the proper court issuing the same for trial, unless such arrest
shall be made in the nighttime or upon Sunday, in which case such officer may
detain the person in custody until he can be brought before such court. (R.O.
1908, Ord. 15; amd. 1974 Code; Ord. 79-3, 5-7-1979, eff. 5-8-1979)
1-4-8: PROCEED WITH TRIAL:
In case the officer issuing the warrant is, on account of sickness or other
cause, unable to attend the trial of said offender, it shall be the duty of the
officer having the custody of the person arrested to convey him to the nearest
proper county officer for trial, and without unnecessary delay, proceed with
the trial of such person in the same manner as if warrant had been issued by
said officer. (R.O. 1908, Ord. 15; amd. 1974 Code; Ord. 79-3, 5-7-1979, eff. 5-
8-1979)
1-4-9: ENTER JUDGMENT:
Upon the person so arrested being produced before him, the proper officer shall
proceed with the examination or trial without unnecessary delay, and shall
immediately upon conviction enter judgment against the defendant in favor of
the village for the amount of fine or penalty and costs of prosecution and
order such person to be committed until such fine or penalty and costs are
paid. (R.O. 1908, Ord. 15; amd. 1974 Code)
1-4-10: ARREST WITHOUT A WARRANT:
In all cases where any person is arrested on view, without a warrant, the
officer making the arrest, without unnecessary delay, shall take such person
before the proper officer who shall proceed to hear and determine the matter,
as in other cases. (R.O. 1908, Ord. 15; amd. 1974 Code)
1-4-11: EXECUTION OF DUTY:
All village officers shall, unless otherwise directed by this or some other
village code provision, proceed in the execution of their duty in the same
manner as such officers are required to proceed under the laws of the state in
similar cases, and all general laws in force and relating to proceedings in
action before the proper officer, and the duties of marshals are hereby
declared to be in force in the village for the government of such officers in
the discharge of their duties. (R.O. 1908, Ord. 15; amd. 1974 Code)
1-4-12: SUIT BY SUMMONS:
When suit to recover any fine or penalty is begun by summons, it shall be in
the ordinary form of summons in civil actions, except that it shall state the
code provision violated and the particular breach thereof, which summons shall
be served and trial and subsequent proceedings had as in other civil
proceedings had before the proper officer. (R.O. 1908, Ord. 15; amd. 1974 Code)
1-4-13: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS FOR ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS:
   (A)   Any village officer authorized to enforce the provisions of this code,
including any law enforcement officer acting on behalf of the village and the
code official as set forth in section
7-4-13 of this code, may issue and serve administrative enforcement citations
to an offender for a violation of this code. Furthermore, the village clerk may
issue administrative enforcement citations by certified mail to the offender.
   (B)   Every administrative enforcement citation issued under this provision
shall impose a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) to be paid to the village
of Roanoke, unless the code provision specifically provides a lesser fine, in
which case the maximum fine specifically set forth in such code provision shall
be paid to the village of Roanoke. A fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00)
shall be imposed for a second violation of the same code provision by the same
person or responsible party within a twelve (12) month period beginning on the
date of the first violation of the particular code provision. A fine of three
hundred dollars ($300.00) shall be imposed for a third or subsequent violation
of the same code provision by the same person or responsible party within a
twelve (12) month period beginning on the date of the first violation of the
particular code provision. If a provision of this code provides for a penalty
of less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a first offense charged as an
administrative enforcement action under this section, then the specific fine
amount set forth for a first offense shall be doubled for a second offense and
tripled for a third or subsequent offense during the twelve (12) month period
as described above in this section. Payment of any fine under this section
shall be made to the village clerk at the village hall. Any check tendered to
pay a fine under this section which is returned to village unpaid for any
reason shall not be considered to be "full payment" under this section.
   (C)   The offender shall pay any fine imposed under this section within
thirty (30) calendar days, unless a shorter period of time is specifically
provided by the applicable code provision. If the fine imposed under this
provision is not paid within the required thirty (30) day period, the fine
shall increase as provided herein. If the fine is imposed for a first violation
within a twelve (12) month period and is not paid within the required thirty
(30) day period, the fine shall be increased to two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) to be paid to the village, regardless of the amount of the fine for
this initial offense in a twelve (12) month period if the fine was paid during
the required thirty (30) day period. If the fine is imposed for a second
violation within a twelve (12) month period and is not paid within the required
thirty (30) day period, the fine shall be increased to three hundred fifty
dollars ($350.00) to be paid to the village, regardless of the amount of the
fine for this second offense in a twelve (12) month period. If the fine is
imposed for a third or subsequent violation within a twelve (12) month period
and is not paid within the required thirty (30) day period, the fine shall be
increased to four hundred fifty dollars ($450.00) to be paid to the village,
regardless of the amount of the fine for this third or subsequent offense in a
twelve (12) month period.
   (D)   This administrative enforcement process shall not initiate any court
proceedings related to a particular violation of this code and shall be
independent of any court proceeding related to the enforcement of this code.
Furthermore, action taken under this section shall not prevent the village from
pursuing other types of enforcement action against the offender or another
person for the same violation. However, any violation of this code which is
concluded by the full payment of the fine amount set forth above by the
offender in the specified time period shall not be brought by the village as an
action against that offender to recover a fine for such violation in a court
proceeding. (Ord. 2003-12, 10-20-2003; amd. Ord. 2019-02, 3-4-2019)

following conditions:
         (a)   The Board member must notify the Village Clerk (or designee) as
soon as practicable before the meeting of the Board member's request to
electronically attend the meeting so that necessary communications equipment
can be made available.

            (1)   A Board member has requested permission to electronically
attend the meeting, and
            (2)    The Board member will be authorized to electronically attend
the meeting unless a motion objecting to the member's electronic attendance is
made, seconded, and adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the
Village Board physically present at the meeting.
         (b)   If a motion objecting to the Board member's participation is
made and approved by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Village Board
physically present at the meeting, the member making the request may not
electronically attend the meeting. If no such motion is made and seconded or if
any such motion is made and seconded but not approved by a two-thirds majority
of the members of the Village Board physically present at the meeting, then the
request by the member to electronically attend the meeting shall be deemed
approved by the Village Board, and the Village President or other presiding
officer shall declare that the requesting member is present at the Board
meeting. After such declaration by the Village President or presiding officer,
the ability of the Board member to electronically participate in that Board
meeting may not be withdrawn for the remainder of that meeting.

electronically attends shall identify any such member as attending by
electronic means.

same conditions as members who are physically present, provided the member
attending electronically shall announce when leaving and returning to the
meeting.
      7.   The Village Board may electronically hold any open or closed meeting
via telephone, video, internet connection, or other electronic technology which
allows for effective audio or video conferencing between the Board members from

notice from the Village of these fees and costs. The written notice shall

collected by the Village under this Section, the deposit shall be applied to
the Village's legal fees and costs when the requested project or action is
completed. The requesting party shall be responsible for reimbursing the

   VILLAGE PERSONNEL:
Part Time/Temporary Employees: A part time employee is one who works less than
thirty two (32) hours per week; a temporary employee is one who works less than
one thousand (1,000) hours per year.
Part time or temporary employees may be hired by the Superintendent of Public

to provide employees with time off necessitated by sickness and ill health and
to address personal business. Therefore, all employees shall be granted paid
time off (“PTO”) in lieu of specified vacation, personal, or sick leave as

the employee works on a regular workday during a regular five (5) day workweek.
      For example, if a regular full time employee works thirty (30) hours
during a regular workweek, then the employee’s PTO day is six (6) hours.

PTO time until ninety (90) days after the part-time employee’s hire date. If

salary up to one workweek of PTO time for any unused PTO time exceeding three
(3) PTO days. The employee can only convert unused PTO time in excess of three
(3) PTO days and may not convert the baseline three (3) unused PTO days. In the
event that approval is granted, the full-time employee shall be compensated at
the employee’s applicable regular hourly rate times the number of hours of
unused PTO up to the one workweek (5 PTO days) maximum, or in the case of a
salaried employee, the full-time employee shall be compensated at the

full-time employee may rollover up to a maximum of one workweek of unused PTO
time exceeding three (3) PTO days for that Employment Year to the next

days (a maximum of 5 PTO days) no later than ten (10) calendar days after the
conclusion of the employee’s Employment Year. Under no circumstance shall an
employee rollover more than five (5) unused PTO days from one Employment Year
to the next Employment Year.
      4.   For part-time employees who do not use all their PTO time prior to
the end of their Employment Year, the employee shall have an additional sixty
(60) days after the beginning of the next Employment Year to use any remaining,
unused PTO time. If the PTO time is not used within the Employment Year or this
60-day period after the beginning of the employee’s next Employment Year, the
part-time employee will lose any remaining unused PTO time. Part-time employees
shall not have the option to convert unused PTO to wages or salary.
   (E)   Requesting And Scheduling PTO Time: Except when used for an unplanned
absence due to illness, medical condition or a personal or family emergency
situation, use of PTO must be scheduled and cleared with the employee’s
supervisor, and if the employee does not have a supervisor, with the village

of the PTO time. However, all vacation PTO time of four (4) consecutive days or
more must be cleared with the employee’s supervisor and the village president
at least thirty (30) days in advance of the time when the employee wishes to

in harassment, or threaten to use political or personal influence or bias to
secure or deny changes in pay, grade, or character of work.

         (c)   That, in all solicitations or advertisements for employees
placed by him or her or on his or her behalf, he or she will state that all

Notes

1-7-23: HARASSMENT (INCLUDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT) AND DISCRIMINATION POLICY:
   (A)   Statement Of Policy:
The Village strives to maintain an environment free from discrimination and
harassment, where employees, elected officials, and appointed officials treat
each other with respect, dignity, and courtesy. This policy applies to all
phases of employment, including but not limited to, recruiting, testing,
hiring, promoting, demoting, transferring, laying off, terminating, paying,
granting benefits, and training. Further, this policy shall apply to all
elected or appointed Village officials, all Village employees and agents, and
all members of any Village Boards, Committees, or Commissions.
The Village does not and will not tolerate any type of harassment of employees,
applicants for employment, or customers. Therefore, it is the Village's policy
that it will not tolerate or condone discrimination or harassment on the basis
of race, color, religion, creed, sex, gender-identity, gender-expression,
sexual orientation, pregnancy, childbirth, medical or common conditions
relating to pregnancy and childbirth, genetic information, national origin,
age, physical or mental disability, ancestry, marital status, military status,
arrest record, unfavorable discharge from military service, order of protection
status, citizenship status or any other classification protected under federal
or state law. Sexual misconduct is also prohibited. The Village will neither
tolerate nor condone discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct by
employees, managers, supervisors, elected officials, co-workers, or non-
employees with whom Village has a business, service, or professional
relationship. Further, retaliation and the filing of false reports as provided
in this policy is a violation of this policy and is prohibited.
"Employee," for purposes of this policy only, includes any individual
performing work for Village, an apprentice, an applicant for apprenticeship, or
an unpaid intern.
The Village has appointed Jennifer Crumrine as the Village's Ethics Officer,
and her duties shall include receiving and overseeing investigations of
complaints made pursuant to this policy. She can be contacted by email at
roanoke@mchsi.com or by phone at 309-923-3661. The Village reserves the right
to change the Ethics Officer from time to time.
   (B)   Prohibition On Sexual Harassment And Sexual Misconduct:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the Village to prohibit harassment of any
person by any Village official, Village agent, Village employee or Village
agency or office, including the harassment on the basis of sex or gender. All
Village officials, Village agents, Village employees and Village agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
Further, sexual misconduct is strictly prohibited by the Village and can
include any inappropriate and/or illegal conduct of a sexual nature including,
but not limited to, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, sexual intimidation,
rape, sexual assault, or ANY sexual contact or sexual communications with a
minor (including, but not limited to, conduct or communications which are
written, electronic, verbal, visual, virtual or physical).
   (C)   Definition Of Sexual Harassment:
      1.   As provided herein, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct are
prohibited. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors, or any other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive working environment.
      2.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal: Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature;
         (b)   Non-verbal: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls," "smacking"
or "kissing" noises;
         (c)   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites;
         (d)   Physical: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault; and
         (e)   Text/Electronic: "Sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
      3.   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. However, on the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is
more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person." Further, sexual harassment can occur in a
variety of circumstances, including but not limited to the following:
         (a)   The employee as well as the harasser may be a woman or a man;
the employee does not have to be of the opposite sex.
         (b)   The harasser can be the employee's supervisor, an agent of the
employer, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or a non-employee.
         (c)   The employee does not have to be the person harassed, but could
be anyone affected by the offensive conduct.
         (d)   Unlawful sexual harassment may occur without economic injury to
or discharge of the employee.
         (e)   The harasser's conduct must be unwelcome.
   (D)   Responsibilities - Supervisors: Each supervisor shall be responsible
for ensuring compliance with this policy, including the following:
      1.   Monitoring the workplace environment for signs of discrimination,
harassment, or sexual misconduct;
      2.   Immediately notifying law enforcement where there is reasonable
belief that the observed or complained of conduct violates the criminal laws of
the State of Illinois.
      3.   Immediately notifying the Department of Children and Family Services
(DCFS) Hotline (1-800-25-ABUSE or 1-800-252-2873) if the observed or complained
of conduct involves the abuse of a minor.
      4.   Immediately stopping any observed acts of discrimination,
harassment, or sexual misconduct and taking appropriate steps to intervene,
whether or not the involved employees are within his/her line of supervision;
      5.   Immediately reporting any complaint of harassment, discrimination,
or sexual misconduct to the Ethics Officer or to the Village President, and:
      6.   Taking immediate action to limit the work contact between the
individuals when there has been a complaint of discrimination, harassment, or
sexual misconduct, pending investigation.
   (E)   Responsibilities - Employees: Each employee must exercise good
judgment to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by others as sexual
harassment or harassment based on any status protected by law. Further, each
employee is responsible for assisting in the prevention of discrimination,
harassment, and sexual misconduct through the following acts:
      1.   Refraining from participation in, or encouragement of, actions that
could be perceived as discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct;
   2.   Immediately reporting any violations of this policy to a supervisor,
the Ethics Officer, or the Village President and law enforcement (if
appropriate under the circumstances) and/or DCFS (if appropriate under the
circum   stances). Employees are obligated to report violations of this policy
as soon as they occur. An employee should not wait until the conduct becomes
unbearable before reporting the prohibited conduct. All employees are obligated
to report instances of prohibited conduct even if the conduct is merely
observed and directed toward another individual and even if the other person
does not appear to be bothered or offended by the conduct. All employees are
obligated to report instances of prohibited conduct regardless of the identity
of the alleged offender (e.g. man, woman, supervisor, elected official, co-
worker, volunteer, vendor, member of public).
      3.   Encouraging any employee who confides that he/she is the victim of
conduct in violation of this policy to report these acts to a supervisor or the
Ethics Officer.
An employee's failure to take action to stop known discrimination, harassment,
or sexual misconduct may be grounds for discipline.
There is a clear line in most cases between a mutual attraction and a
consensual exchange and unwelcome behavior or pressure for an intimate
relationship. A friendly interaction between two persons who are receptive to
one another is not considered unwelcome or harassment. Employees are free to
form social relationships of their own choosing. However, when one employee is
pursuing or forcing a relationship upon another who does not like or want it,
regardless of friendly intentions, the behavior is unwelcome sexual behavior.
An employee confronted with these actions is encouraged to inform the harasser
that such behavior is offensive and must stop. You should assume that sexual
comments are unwelcome unless you have clear unequivocal indications to the
contrary. In other words, another person does not have to tell you to stop for
your conduct to be harassment and unwelcome. Moreover, sexual communications
and sexual contact with a minor are ALWAYS prohibited.
If you are advised by another person that your behavior is offensive, you must
immediately stop the behavior, regardless of whether you agree with the
person's perceptions of your intentions. The following are illustrations of
actions that the Village deems inappropriate and in violation of this policy:
         (a)   Unwanted sexual advances;
         (b)   Offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors;
         (c)   Retaliating or threatening retaliation after a negative response
to a sexual advance or after an employee has made or threatened to make a
harassment complaint;
         (d)   Visual conduct such as leering, making sexual gestures,
displaying sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons, calendars or
posters;
         (e)   Verbal conduct such as making derogatory comments, using
epithets or slurs, making sexually explicit jokes or suggestive comments about
a person's body or dress;
         (f)   Written or electronic communications of a sexual nature or
containing statements or images which may be offensive to individuals in a
particular protected group, such as racial or ethnic stereotypes or stereotypes
about disabled individuals; and
         (g)   Physical conduct such as unwanted touching, assaulting, impeding
or blocking movements.
The Village does not consider conduct in violation of this policy to be within
the course and scope of employment and does not sanction such conduct on the
part of any employee, including supervisory and management employees.
   (F)   Procedures For Reporting An Allegation Of Harassment: The Village
takes allegations of discrimination, harassment, and sexual misconduct very
seriously and will actively investigate all complaints
      1.   Direct Communication. If there is sexual harassing behavior in the
workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express her/his
objection to the other employee that the conduct is unwelcome and request that
the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      2.   Bringing a Complaint. Any employee of Village who believes that
there has been a violation of this policy may bring the matter to the attention
of Village in one of the following ways by advising his or her supervisor or
the Ethics Officer, or in the event that the alleged harasser is the Ethics
Officer, advising the Village President.
If the complaint involves someone in the employee's direct line of command,
then the employee should go directly to the Ethics Officer or the Village
President. The complaint should be presented as promptly as possible after the
alleged violation of this policy occurs.
The Village will take steps to ensure that complaints made are kept
confidential to the extent permissible under the law. Individuals who are
involved in an investigation under this policy are required to keep the matter
confidential to the fullest extent permitted under the law.
      3.   Resolution Outside of the Village. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
Village. However, all Village employees have the right to contact the Inspector
General, the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) at 312-814-6200, or the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) at 800-669-4000, for information
regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must
be filed within three hundred (300) days of the alleged incident(s) unless it
is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within three
hundred (300) days.
   (G)   Resolution of a Complaint: Promptly after a complaint is submitted,
the Village will undertake such investigation, corrective and preventive
actions as are appropriate. In general, the procedure in resolving any
complaints can (but will not necessarily) include any of the following items:
      1.   A meeting between the employee making the complaint and an
individual designated by the Village to investigate such complaints. Important
data to be provided by the complaining employee includes the following:
         (a)   A description of the specific offensive conduct;
         (b)   Identification of all person(s) who engaged in the conduct;
         (c)   The location where the conduct occurred;
         (d)   The time when the conduct occurred;
         (e)   Whether there were any witnesses to the conduct;
         (f)   Whether conduct of a similar nature has occurred on prior
occasions;
         (g)   Whether there are any documents which would support the
complaining employee's allegations; and
         (h)   What impact the conduct had on the complaining employee.
      2.   While not required, the Village encourages anyone who makes a
complaint under this policy to provide a written statement setting forth the
above details and attaching any pertinent records.
      3.   After a complaint is submitted by the employee, the alleged
offending individual should be contacted by a designated representative of the
Village. The alleged offending individual should be advised of the charges
brought against him or her, and may be provided with a copy of the written
statement of complaint made by the complaining employee (if applicable). The
alleged offending individual should have an opportunity to fully explain his or
her side of the circumstances, and may also submit a written statement, if
desired.
      4.   After the alleged offending individual is interviewed, any witnesses
identified by either the complaining employee or the alleged offending
individual may be interviewed separately.
      5.   Once this investigation is completed, the Village will take such
action as is appropriate based upon the information obtained in the
investigation.
      6.   Upon completion of the investigation, the Village will advise the
complaining employee of the results of the investigation, including action
taken, if any, against the offending individual.
When investigating alleged violations of this policy, the Village looks at the
whole record including, but not limited to, the nature of the allegations, the
context in which the alleged incidents occurred, and the statements of the
parties and witnesses. A determination on the allegations is made from the
facts on a case-by-case basis.
   (H)   Reporting and Independent Review of an Allegation of Sexual Harassment
Made Against an Elected Village Official by Another Elected Village Official
In addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official who
either observes another elected official engage in sexual harassment or
believes himself or herself to be the object of sexual harassment by another
elected official may report such conduct for independent review to the Village
Attorney. If the Village Attorney believes a conflict exists which prevents the
Village Attorney from conducting an independent review, the Village Attorney
must notify the Village President or Village Board of such conflict. Upon
receiving notification of the conflict, the Village President or Village Board
shall authorize the engagement of outside legal counsel to conduct the review.
The Village Attorney or outside legal counsel shall conduct an independent
review of the allegations and provide any findings to the Village Board. Any
documents, communications or other records created pursuant to the review shall
remain confidential, subject to attorney-client privilege, and will not be
disclosed unless such disclosure is authorized by resolution with the
concurrence of a majority of all members then holding office on the Village
Board or as otherwise required by applicable State or federal law.
Such records shall also be presumed as exempt from disclosure under the Freedom
of Information Act, to the extent it is applicable.
   (I)   Consequences For A Violation Of This Policy: In the event that the
Village finds merit in the charges made by the complaining employee,
disciplinary action will be taken against the offending employee. This
disciplinary action may, but need not necessarily, include:
      1.   Verbal or written reprimand;
      2.   Placing the offending employee on a corrective action plan for a
period of time to be identified;
      3.   Delay in pay increases or promotions;
      4.   Suspending the offending employee from work without pay;
      5.   Demotion; or
      6.   Immediate termination.
Further, each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline
imposed by the Village shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed
by a State ethics commission or from any fines or penalties imposed by a court
of law or a State or Federal agency.
   (J)   Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment
Allegations:    
      1.   No Village official or employee shall take any retaliatory action
against any Village employee due to a Village employee's:
         (a)   Disclosing or threatening to disclose any violation of this
policy;
         (b)   Providing information related to or testifying before any public
body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of
this policy; or
         (c)   Assisting or participating in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      2.   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any Village employee that is
taken in retaliation for a Village employee's involvement in protected activity
pursuant to this policy.
      3.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. Further, any witness will be
protected from retaliation.
      4.   Additionally, in relation to sexual harassment, Illinois law
provides protections to persons making a report under this policy or to any
person who assists or participates in the investigation of an alleged violation
of this policy. As set forth in the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15) and the
Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), such persons are provided
protections as whistleblowers from retaliatory action such as reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs
in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any municipal officer or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of this policy
or other law, rule, or regulation;
         (c)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of this
policy or other law, rule, or regulation by any municipal officer or other
employee; or
         (c)   Assists or participates in any proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy or the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      5.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
      6.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is
a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire,
to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
      7.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR (312-814-6200)
or EEOC (800-669-4000), may file a retaliation charge - due within one hundred
and eighty (180) days (IDHR) or three hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged
retaliation.
   (K)   Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report: A false report is a
report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment
report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith. Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused,
a false or frivolous report of sexual harassment is a severe offense that can
itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a
false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall be
subject to discipline or discharge as provided in this policy. Further, this
provision covers any false report of harassment, not just sexual harassment.
   (L)   Education/Training:
      1.   Education and training for Village employees are critical to the
success of the Village's policy against harassment and discrimination. The
policy set forth in this Section
1-7-23 of the Village Code will be distributed to current employees, recently
hired employee, and all elected and appointed officials of the Village. All
employees and all elected and appointed Village officials are required to read
and sign a receipt of the Village's policy set forth in this Section
1-7-23 of the Village Code. In addition, employees will receive annual training
regarding this policy.
      2.   The training shall include, at a minimum, the following: (i) the
definition and a description of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination, and
harassment, including examples of each; (ii) details on how an individual can
report an allegation of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination, or
harassment, including options for making a confidential report to a supervisor
or the Department of Human Rights; (iii) the definition and description of
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination, or
harassment allegations utilizing examples, including availability of
whistleblower protections under the Workplace Transparency Act, the
Whistleblower Act, and the Illinois Human Rights Act; and (iv) the consequences
of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment, unlawful
discrimination, and harassment and the consequences for knowingly making a
false report. All newly hired employees and all elected and appointed Village
officials will complete an initial harassment and discrimination prevention
training program within 30 days after commencement of employment with the
Village or becoming an elected or appointed Village employee.
      3.   Additionally, all supervisory employees will participate in training
sessions so that they understand their responsibilities under this policy and
complaint procedure. Such training will explain the types of conduct that
violate the Village's policy, the seriousness of the policy, the
responsibilities of supervisors when they learn of alleged harassment or
discrimination, and the prohibition against retaliation. (Ord. 2017-13, 12-18-
2017; amd. Ord. 2020-08, 6-22-2020)
1-7-24: DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY:
   (A)   Generally: The Village is committed to programs that promote safety in
the workplace, employee health and well- being, and citizens' confidence.
Employee involvement with drugs and alcohol can adversely affect job
performance and employee morale, jeopardize employee safety, and undermine
citizens' confidence. The Village's goal, therefore, and the purpose of this
section, is to establish and maintain a healthy and efficient work force free
from the effects of drug and alcohol abuse. Consistent with this goal and
commitment, and in response to the requirements of the Drug- Free Workplace Act
1 , as amended, the Village has developed this section regarding the use, sale,
possession, and distribution of controlled substances, including cannabis, and
alcohol by its employees.
   (B)   Testing Process:
      1.   Testing Circumstances:
         (a)   Pre-Employment: Applicants for Village positions will be tested
for drugs before they are employed. Employment is contingent upon a negative
test result.
         (b)   Reasonable Suspicion:
            (1)   A covered employee may be tested for alcohol and/or drugs
whenever there is reason to believe that the employee has violated the
prohibitions of this section, or is impaired by any drug or alcohol. A Village
representative's determination that a reason to believe exists will be based on
specific observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body
odors of the employee. A registered qualifying user of medical cannabis under
the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act must first be given
a reasonable opportunity to contest the basis of the suspected impairment
before being subject to discipline based on a reasonable suspicion of
impairment.
            (2)   The Village representative's basis for ordering a drug/
alcohol test shall be documented. The document must be completed and signed by
the Village representative within two (2) hours of the observed behavior, or
before the results of the test are released, whichever is later, unless
circumstances preclude it. The supervisor, Village official, or his designee,
shall arrange transportation of the employee to the testing facility.
            (3)   An employee directed to complete a test will immediately
report for testing upon receipt of this direction by the Village. Covered
employees may not be returned to the performance of safety sensitive functions
until cleared by a negative reasonable suspicion test.
         (c)   Post-Accident:
            (1)   As soon as practicable following an accident involving any
motor vehicle or in which there is an injury or damage to any property from the
accident while on duty, the covered employee will be tested both for alcohol
and drugs. As soon as practicable following the accident, the covered employee
must contact his/her supervisor to explain that he/she was involved in an
accident while on duty. The employee must inform his/her supervisor if any type
of alcohol or drug tests was/were administered after the accident. The
supervisor shall arrange with a testing facility an appointment for the
employee to be tested for whichever tests have not been administered
immediately upon the employee's return. A covered employee subject to post-
accident testing must not use alcohol for eight (8) hours following the
accident or until he/she undergoes an alcohol test, whichever occurs first, and
shall not take any drug until a test is performed, unless medically essential.
            (2)   A covered employee subject to post-accident testing shall
remain readily available for testing or will be deemed by the Village to have
refused to submit to testing.
            (3)   Any refusal to complete a test when directed will be deemed
insubordination and disciplined in accordance with the terms of this section
accordingly.
         (d)   Functional Impairment: Employees must notify their supervisors
if they are using a substance, either administered by a physician or over the
counter, which may impair their ability to function on duty.
         (e)   Random Testing: Any employees required to be tested on a random
basis pursuant to law or regulations shall be tested, as required.
         (f)   Testing Facility: All specimen samples for required tests will
be collected at an approved testing facility.
      2.   Test Protocols:
         (a)   Alcohol: The alcohol test will be conducted using an evidential
breath testing device (EBTD) or any other DHHS approved testing method. The
alcohol test is generally a two- part process; a screening test and a
confirmation test. If the screening test results in a negative reading, no
further tests are required. However, a positive result on a screening test will
require a confirmation test 15 - 20 minutes later. No adverse action will be
taken against an employee without a positive confirmation test. The testing
methods or devices set forth herein shall not apply where the employee is
tested by any police agency incident to any traffic stop or at a hospital or
medical facility where the employee is taken after the accident. A reading of a
blood alcohol content (BAC) of less than .041 shall be considered a negative
reading for alcohol use, except that the CDL provisions and BAC levels shall
apply to any employee required to hold a CDL for their position with the
Village.
         (b)   Drugs: The drug test will be urine test or any other DHHS
approved testing method and will include, without limitations the following
drugs: amphetamines, cannabinoids (marijuana), phencyclidine (PCP), cocaine,
and opiates. Split-sample, hair-sample, or blood-sample collection techniques
will be used. When the test of the primary specimen is negative, the laboratory
disposes of the sample. When the test of the primary specimen is confirmed
positive, the laboratory continues to hold the remaining sample to ensure that
it remains available for a second test. The Medical Review Officer at the
testing laboratory (MRO) or the Village will notify each employee who has a
confirmed positive test that the employee has seventy two (72) hours in which
to request a test of the remaining sample. The employee will pay the cost of
testing the remaining sample.
         (c)   Prescription Drugs: At the time of the testing, the employee
shall notify the testing facility of any prescription drugs that the employee
is taking and shall provide a copy of said prescriptions to the testing
facility within twenty four (24) hours of testing.
      3.   Test Results:
         (a)   Alcohol tests are read at the testing facility and are normally
immediately available to the employee. Supervisors will be notified by phone of
the test results. The testing facility will forward the follow-up test result
written confirmation to the Village representative or designee. The results of
drug tests will not be available until the completion of the testing and
evaluation process.
         (b)   The Village will make transportation arrangements to and from
the testing facility for all employees directed for testing.
         (c)   The MRO or Village representative should work directly with the
employee to ascertain if there was a legitimate reason for the positive test
prior to the test results being considered and reported to the supervisor as
positive.
      4.   Record Keeping: The Village President or Village Clerk will prepare
and maintain records of the alcohol and drug testing program; access to these
records will be controlled and held in a confidential manner with the
employee's records.
         (a)   A covered employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain
copies of or have distributed any records pertaining to him/her related to the
Alcohol and Drug Testing Program.
         (b)   Records will be made available to a subsequent employer upon
receipt of a written request from a covered or previously covered employee.
      5.   Cost Of Testing: Except as indicated above, the Village shall pay
all costs of testing for drugs and/or alcohol required by this section. If any
employee requests a re-test of a sample in order to challenge the results, the
employee shall pay all costs of the re-test.
   (C)   Rehabilitation: An employee, who, for the first time, is subject to
discipline for being under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, or
abusing prescription drugs, after employer mandated testing, may elect to
participate in a residential or out-patient rehabilitation program. In such
cases, the severity of the disciplinary action taken under this section will
take into account the employee's effort at rehabilitation, as well as his/her
offense. An employee who elects to participate in a rehabilitation program must
provide the Village with written evidence of successful completion of the
program and evidence from an aftercare treatment facility or continued
participation in any recommended treatment.
   (D)   Employee Assistance Program: The Village encourages any employee who
feels he or she has a drug or alcohol problem to contact his or her immediate
supervisor for assistance. The Village will, at the employee's request, refer
him or her to the employee's designated healthcare provider for information or
professional assistance, which will be at the employee's expense over and above
any covered benefit amount. All communications will be strictly confidential.
Employees will not be subject to discipline for seeking such assistance prior
to detection. However, this will not thereafter excuse violation of this drug
and alcohol policy for which the employee is subject to discipline.
   (E)   Discipline And Discharge: Employees found to be under the influence of
illegal drugs in accordance with the testing procedure set forth in this
section for the first time may have their discharge suspended, subject to a
last chance agreement providing for a 30-day suspension without pay, if the
employee seeks treatment as provided in this section. Employees found to be
under the influence of illegal drugs in accordance with the testing procedures
set forth in this section a second time and those employees refusing to
participate in treatment programs as provided in this section, as well as those
employees who refuse to submit to testing, shall be immediately discharged.
Additionally, employees found to be intentionally tampering with, causing
another person to tamper with, substituting for, or causing another person to
substitute for an employee's urine, spit, blood, or hair specimen shall be
immediately discharged. Discipline for violations of the drug and alcohol
policy shall be governed solely by this section and any prior actions by this
board for discipline of such violations shall not be given any consideration by
the Village Board.
   (F)   Use, Possession, Transportation, Sale, Distribution: The use,
possession, sale, transportation, or distribution of controlled substances,
including cannabis, or alcohol by anyone while on Village property or on
Village business shall be cause for discharge. Controlled substances or alcohol
shall be taken into custody, and the appropriate law enforcement agencies will
be notified. For purposes of this section, the term "Village property" shall
include all land, buildings, structures, parking lots, and means of
transportation owned by or leased to the Village.
   (G)   Over-The-Counter Or Prescribed Medications: Employees who take over-
the-counter or prescribed medication are responsible for being aware of any
effect the medication may have on the performance of their duties and must
promptly report to their supervisors the use of medication likely to impair
their ability to do their jobs. An employee who fails to do so shall be subject
to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Moreover, employees who
take over-the- counter or prescribed medication contrary to doctor's
instructions shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
discharge. (Ord. 2017-14, 12-18-2017)

1-12-14: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 2002-02, 3-4-
2002)
1-12-15: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 2002-02, 3-4-2002)
1-12-16: LIEN REVIEW PROCEDURE:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
2002-02, 3-4-2002)
1-12-17: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the village's tax ordinances. Except when specifically set forth in this
chapter that the other tax ordinance is controlling, to the extent that any tax
ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter
shall be controlling. (Ord. 2002-02, 3-4-2002)
1-12-18: SEVERABILITY:

member, representative, agent or employee of such licensee to sell, give, or
deliver alcoholic liquor to any person under the age of twenty one (21) years
or to any intoxicated person. No person, after purchasing or otherwise
obtaining alcoholic liquor, shall sell, give or deliver such alcoholic liquor
to another person under the age of twenty one (21) years, except in the
performance of a religious ceremony or service. If a licensee or officer,
associate, agent, or employee of the licensee is prosecuted under this
subsection (A) for selling, giving, or delivering alcoholic liquor to a person
under the age of twenty one (21) years, the person under twenty one (21) years
of age who attempted to buy or receive the alcoholic liquor may be prosecuted
pursuant to section
3-4-24 of this chapter, unless the person under twenty one (21) years of age
was acting under the authority of a law enforcement agency, the Illinois liquor
control commission, or the local liquor control commissioner pursuant to a plan
or action to investigate, patrol, or conduct any similar enforcement action.
      2.   For the purpose of preventing the violation of this section, any
licensee, or his agent or employee shall refuse to sell, deliver, or serve
alcoholic beverages to any person who is unable to produce adequate written
evidence of identity and of the fact that he or she is over the age of twenty
one (21) years, if requested by the licensee, agent, employee, or
representative.
However, no agent or employee of the licensee shall be disciplined or
discharged for selling or furnishing liquor to a person under twenty one (21)
years of age if the agent or employee demanded and was shown, before furnishing
liquor to a person under twenty one (21) years of age, adequate written
evidence of age and identity of the person issued by a federal, state, county
or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not
limited to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate
issued under the federal selective service act, or an identification card
issued to a member of the armed forces. This paragraph, however, shall not
apply if the agent or employee accepted the written evidence knowing it to be
false or fraudulent.
Adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person is a document
issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal government, or subdivision or
agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's
license, a registration certificate issued under the federal selective service
act, or an identification card issued to a member of the armed forces. Proof
that the defendant-licensee, or his employee or agent demanded, was shown and
reasonably relied upon such written evidence in any transaction forbidden by
this section is an affirmative defense in any criminal prosecution therefor or
to any proceedings for the suspension or revocation of any license based
thereon. It shall not, however, be an affirmative defense if the agent or
employee accepted the written evidence knowing it to be false or fraudulent. If
a false or fraudulent Illinois driver's license or Illinois identification card

rights and privileges associated therewith in the event that:
      1.   Grantee has not substantially complied with a material provision of
this chapter, the franchise agreement, or of any supplemental written agreement

sixty (60) days' written notice of its intention to terminate and stipulate the
cause. A public hearing shall be scheduled for the end of said sixty (60) day

sale, lease, assignment, foreclosure, attachment, merger, or any other form of
disposition, without prior notice to and approval by the village council, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The notice shall include full
identifying particulars of the proposed transaction. For the purpose of
determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition
of control, the village may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective
controlling party and the grantee shall assist the village in any such inquiry.
The village shall have ninety (90) days within which to approve or disapprove,

3-13-7: AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE FRANCHISE:

repair, replace, reconstruct and maintain such poles, wires, cables,
conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
attachments, and other property as may be necessary and appurtenant to the
cable television system; provided, however, that before any pole, wire, or
other thing mentioned above which is necessary and appurtenant to the cable
television system is placed on or within any street, the required permits to do
so must be obtained by the grantee from the village. It shall be unlawful for
any telephone, telegraph, or power company, or any other public utility company
or person, to lease or otherwise make available to any person, any poles,
lines, facilities, equipment, or other property for use in connection with the
operation of a cable television system or the provision of cable television
service, unless such other person holds a valid franchise granted pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter or is a state franchise holder.
   (B)   The authority granted to a grantee pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter is not and shall not be deemed to be an exclusive right or permission.

responsibility and expense, a grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to
the village, within ninety (90) days after the end of its fiscal year, an
annual sum equal to five percent (5.0%) of its gross revenues. This fee shall
be in addition to any and all taxes which are now or may be required hereafter
to be paid pursuant to any federal, state, or local law. This fee shall be
deemed to reimburse the village for all costs of regulating the cable
television system of the grantee and shall cover the expense of all regulatory
requirements including, but not limited to, any performance testing required by
the village under the terms of this chapter and any renewal or transfer
procedures arising hereunder.
   (B)   Acceptance of payments hereunder shall not be construed as a release
or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the village may have for further
or additional sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any
other obligations hereunder. (Ord. 2015-14, 9-21-2015)
3-13-9: LIMITATIONS OF FRANCHISE:

federal bodies and shall comply with any and all ordinances which the village
has adopted or shall adopt applying to the public generally and shall be
subject to all laws of the state of Illinois and the United States.
   (B)   Time shall be of the essence in any franchise granted hereunder. The
grantee shall not be relieved of its obligations to comply promptly with a
provision of this chapter by the failure of the village to enforce compliance.
Failure of the village to enforce any breach by the grantee shall not
constitute a waiver by the village.
   (C)   Any poles, cable, electronic equipment or other appurtenances of the
grantee to be installed in, under, over, along, across or upon a street shall
be so located so as to cause minimum interference with the public use of the
streets and to cause minimum interference with the rights of other users of the
streets or of property owners who adjoin any of the streets.
   (D)   In the event of disturbance of any street, other public property, or
private property by the grantee, it shall, at its own expense and using
reasonable efforts, replace and restore property to the condition existing
before the work was done.
   (E)   Grantee shall contract, maintain and operate the cable television
system so as to cause minimum inconvenience to the general public. All
excavations shall be properly guarded and protected. All excavations shall be
filled and the surface restored promptly after completion of the work at the
grantee's sole cost and expense. The grantee shall at all times comply with all
excavation ordinances of the village.
   (F)   The grantee shall, upon reasonable notice from any person holding a
building moving permit issued by the village, temporarily alter its facilities
to permit the moving of such building. The actual cost of such altering shall
be borne by the person requesting the altering and the grantee shall have the
right to request payment in advance. For the provisions of this subsection,
"reasonable notice" shall be construed to mean at least seventy two (72) hours
prior to the move.
   (G)   If, at any time, in case of fire or disaster in the village it shall
become necessary in the judgment of the village manager or the chief of the
fire department or their designee to cut or move any of the wires, cable
amplifiers, appliances, or appurtenances thereto of the grantee, such cutting
or moving may be done and any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made
by the grantee at no expense to the village. (Ord. 1995-2, 5-1-1995)
3-13-10: ADDITIONAL VILLAGE RIGHTS IN FRANCHISE:
   (A)   The village reserves the right upon reasonable notice to require the
grantee at his expense to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or
remove from the streets any property of the grantee by reason of traffic
conditions, public safety, street construction or excavation, change or
establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes,
power or communication lines, tracts, or other types of structure or
improvements by governmental agencies. "Reasonable notice" for this subsection
shall be construed to mean at least thirty (30) days, except in the case of
emergencies, where no specific notice period shall be required.
   (B)   In the event of the failure by the grantee to complete any work
required by subsection (A) of this section or any work required by village law

done and the grantee shall reimburse the village the reasonable costs thereof
within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized list of such cost.

disaster, to require the grantee to make available to the village, upon
request, grantee's audio override, if any, and community channel, if any, at no
cost, for emergency use during such emergency or disaster period.
   (D)   The village reserves the right during the life of any franchise
hereunder to inspect, upon reasonable notice, at all reasonable hours, the
grantee's contracts and engineering records dealing with gross revenue and
technical service provided by grantee, provided that information pertaining to
service to individual subscribers will be available pursuant to section 631 of
the cable act.
   (E)   The Village reserves the right during the life of any franchise

register with the Village within thirty (30) days after the effective date of
this Chapter or becoming a telecommunications provider, whichever is later, on
a form to be provided by the Village, provided, however, that any
telecommunications retailer that has filed a return pursuant to subsection
3-15-4(C) of this Chapter shall be deemed to have registered in accordance with
this Section.
   (B)   Every telecommunications provider who has registered with the Village
pursuant to subsection (A) of this Section has an affirmative duty to submit an
amended registration form or current return as required by subsection
3-15-4(C) of this Chapter, as the case may be, to the Village within thirty
(30) days from the date of the occurrence of any changes in the information
provided by the telecommunications provider in the registration form or most
recent return on file with the Village. (Ord. 1998-11, 12-7-1998)
3-15-3: FEE IMPOSED:
   (A)   A Village telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee is hereby
imposed upon all telecommunications retailers in the amount of one percent
(1.0%) of all gross charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to
service addresses within the Village for telecommunications originating or
received in the Village.
   (B)   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this Chapter, the Village infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights of way within the Village by telecommunications retailers.
Imposition of the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this Chapter
does not, however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or
imposition of any fees otherwise authorized by law.
   (C)   The Village telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized by this Chapter shall be collected, enforced, and administered as
set forth in Section
3-15-4 of this Chapter. (Ord. 1998-11, 12-7-1998)
3-15-4: COLLECTION, ENFORCEMENT, AND ADMINISTRATION:
   (A)   A telecommunications retailer shall charge to and collect from each
customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the Village infrastructure
maintenance fee attributable to that customer's service address.
   (B)   Unless otherwise approved by the Village Board of Trustees, the
infrastructure maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village not later than the last day of the month subsequent to
the month in which a bill is issued to the customer; provided, however, that
the telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed two percent
(2%) of the Village infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to reimburse
itself for expenses incurred in accounting for and remitting the fee.
   (C)   Remittance of the Municipal infrastructure fee to the Village shall be
accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the Village Board of
Trustees, which shall contain such information as the Village Board of Trustees
may reasonably require.
   (D)   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant
to this Chapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by such
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the Village. The charge imposed under subsection
(A) of this Section by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this Chapter
shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who
provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the
same manner as the original charge for such services.
   (E)   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee
has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this Chapter, whether as
a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be
credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this Chapter, from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the Village Board of Trustees may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three (3) years
after the date of the erroneous payment unless: 1) the credit is used only to
offset a claim of underpayment made by the Village within the applicable
statutory period of limitations, and 2) the credit derives from an overpayment
made by the same telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory
period of limitations.
   (F)   Amounts paid under this Chapter by telecommunications retailers shall
not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts as described
immediately below:
      1.   "Gross charges" for purposes of the Telecommunications Excise Tax
Act;
      2.   "Gross receipts" for purposes of the municipal utility tax as
prescribed in section 8-11-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code;
      3.   "Gross charges" for the purposes of the municipal telecommunications
tax as prescribed in section 8-11-17 of the Illinois Municipal Code;
      4.   "Gross revenue" for purposes of the tax on annual gross revenue of
public utilities prescribed in section 2-202 of the Public Utilities Act.
   (G)   The Village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the
books and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this Chapter
to determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to
the Village for the Village infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of
the amount of the Village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the Village by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the Village plus five percent
(5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any
costs incurred by the Village in conducting the audit, in an amount not to
exceed five percent (5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in
an audit. Said sum shall be paid to the Village within twenty one (21) days
after the date of issuance of an invoice for same.
   (H)   The Village Board of Trustees or its designee, may promulgate such
further or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement
of this Chapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time
to time and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered
pursuant to Section
3-15-2 of this Chapter of such regulations. (Ord. 1998-11, 12-7-1998)
3-15-5: COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS:
Nothing in this Chapter shall excuse any person or entity from obligations
imposed under any law, including, but not limited to:
   (A)   Generally applicable taxes; and

repair of the public rights of way, including standards relating to
freestanding towers and other structures upon the public rights of way, as

applicable taxes or standards governing construction on, over, under, or
within, use of or repair of the public rights of way; and
   (D)   Compliance with any ordinance or provision of this Code concerning
uses or structures not located on, over, or within the rights of way. (Ord.

Any franchise, license, or similar agreements between telecommunications
retailers and the Village entered into before the effective date of this
Chapter regarding the use of public rights of way shall remain valid according
to and for their stated terms except for any fees, charges or other
compensation to the extent waived. (Ord. 1998-11, 12-7-1998)
3-15-7: PENALTIES:

refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be subject
to fine in accordance with the general penalty provisions of this Code. (Ord.
1998-11, 12-7-1998)
3-15-8: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this Chapter.
(Ord. 1998-11, 12-7-1998)
3-15-9: WAIVER AND FEE IMPLEMENTATION:
   (A)   The Village hereby waives all fees, charges, and other compensation
that may accrue, after the effective date of the waiver, to the Village by a
telecommunications retailer pursuant to any existing Village franchise,
license, or similar agreement with a telecommunications retailer during the
time the Village imposes the telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee.
This waiver shall only be effective during the time the infrastructure
maintenance fee provided for in this Chapter is subject to being lawfully
imposed on the telecommunications retailer and collected by the
telecommunications retailer from the customer.
   (B)   The Village Clerk shall send a notice of the waiver by certified mail,
return receipt requested, to each telecommunications retailer with whom the
Village has a franchise.
   (C)   The Village infrastructure maintenance fee provided for in this
Chapter shall become effective and imposed on the first day of the month not
less than ninety (90) days after the Village provides written notice by
certified mail to each telecommunications retailer with whom the Village has an
existing franchise, license, or similar agreement that the Village waives all
compensation under such existing franchise, license, or similar agreement
during such time as the fee is subject to being lawfully imposed and collected
by the retailer and remitted to the Village. The infrastructure maintenance fee
shall apply to gross charges billed on or after the effective date as
established in the preceding sentence. (Ord. 1998-11, 12-7-1998)

Before any permit required by this chapter is issued granting authority to
wreck a building or structure, the person engaged in the work or wrecking the
same shall:
   (A)   File with the director of inspections a bond with sureties to be
approved by the director of inspections, to extend to and cover all such
demolition or wrecking operations carried on through permits obtained
thereunder by such person during any year beginning May 1 and ending April 30,
to indemnify, keep and save harmless the village against any loss, cost,
damage, expense, judgment or liability of any kind whatsoever which the village
may suffer, or which may accrue against, be charged to or be recovered from the
village, or any of its officials, from or by reason or on account of accidents
to persons or property during any such wrecking or demolition operations; and
from or by reason or on account of anything done under or by virtue of any
permit engaged for any such wrecking or demolition operations; and no permit
shall be issued for any wrecking work, except as hereinbefore otherwise
provided during such year until such bond is filed. Such bond shall be in the
sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) and shall be conditioned upon
the performance of the work covered by the permit. There shall be an additional
bond filed in the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), conditioned upon
the restoring and leveling of the premises upon which such wrecking or
demolition operations have been completed.
   (B)   File with the director of inspections a certificate or other verified

demolition of said accessory building himself; provided, said owner files with
the director of inspections a certificate or other verified proof that he
carries homeowners' liability insurance on said home in amounts not less than
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) per person and one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000.00) per occurrence.

nature of a particular wrecking or demolition operation. When determining
whether additional bonds and insurance will be necessary, the director of
inspections shall consider the following relevant factors:

and other safeguards which are to be used in connection with the demolition or
wrecking operation. These specifications and drawings shall be approved by the

building or structure, and the safeguards provided within such drawings and
specifications shall be erected in strict compliance therewith. (Ord. 2003-11,
9-2-2003)
4-1-8: REQUIRED USE OF APRONS AND CANOPIES:
Whenever required by this chapter or the director of inspections, the

has one or more party walls in common with one or more buildings, the property
owner, demolition contractor, or wrecker shall deliver to the director of
inspections a certificate by a licensed architect or licensed structural
engineer to the effect that the adjoining premises do not require anchorage, or
if such certificate indicates that anchorage is necessary, the certificate
shall be accompanied by a drawing signed and sealed by such architect or
engineer and approved by the director of inspections indicating adequate
anchorage of floor and roof joists at not greater than ten foot (10') intervals
for each and every floor and roof resting on such party wall, and the adjoining
premises shall be anchored in strict compliance with such drawings. The written

installations or adjoining public or private properties. (Ord. 2003-11, 9-2-
2003)

provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2003-11, 9-2-2003)

hazards. The director of inspections shall also inspect, or cause to be
inspected, the premises upon the completion of work. (Ord. 2003-11, 9-2-2003)

to the village that upon completion of demolition or wrecking activities, the
premises will be left in a proper and safe condition, and that said applicant
or property owner shall stand liable under their bond for any work done
pursuant to subsection (C) of this section.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, "proper and safe condition" means
that all debris is cleared away, that any excavation remaining is either filled
in and tamped down level with the final grade for the premises or surrounded by
a chainlink or masonry fence at least six feet (6') in height, if such property
is not to be put to immediate use. If the property is to be used for any
purpose within two (2) months after such demolition or wrecking and the
property is not brought to final grade, then adequate barricades, lighted at
night, shall be installed around the perimeter of such excavation during this
time period.
   (B)   Nothing in subsection (A) of this section shall be construed to permit
the maintenance of a public nuisance in permitting the excavations to be fenced
rather than filled. Village officials and the director of inspections retain
the power to require filling of excavations which become a threat to the public
health or safety. Upon receipt of written notice from village officials or the
director of inspections that an excavation must be filled because it presents a
threat to public health or safety, the applicant or property owner shall
immediately fill the excavation. Both the applicant and the property owner
shall be in violation of this provision until the excavation is properly filled
and made safe.
   (C)   If the premises are not cleared or put into a safe condition or work
commenced to do so within ten (10) days of the completion of the demolition or
wrecking, or within three (3) days after receiving notice under subsection (B)
of this section, the director of inspections shall authorize the work to be
done and expenses involved shall be chargeable to the posted bond.

or property owner to occupy a roadway or sidewalk beyond the limits of the
premises undergoing demolition to include any adjacent roadway or sidewalk. The
demolition contractor or property owner shall obtain consent from the owner or
lessee of the adjacent property for closure of any sidewalks, unless the
director of inspections otherwise determines that closure of the sidewalk is
necessary for safety reasons. The director of inspections may approve the
closure of any roadway after consulting with village officials and the chief of
the Roanoke fire protection district. (Ord. 2003-11, 9-2-2003)
4-1-15: GENERAL REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO DEMOLITION OR WRECKING ACTIVITIES:

of this section
6-1-34 of the village code as the minimum fine for the violation. A separate

In addition to any fine imposed for a violation of this section of the Village
Code, a person convicted of a violation of this section shall be required to
reimburse the Village for the reasonable cost of removal and disposal of the

dog" is defined as:
      1.   Any individual dog that, without provocation, bites or attacks a
human being or domestic animal either on public or private property; or
      2.   Any individual dog that has a known propensity, tendency or
disposition to attack without provocation, to cause injury, or to otherwise
endanger the safety of human beings or domestic animals; or
      3.   Any individual dog that is owned or harbored primarily or in part
for the purpose of dogfighting or is trained for dogfighting; or
      4.   Any individual dog that has, upon two (2) separate occasions, when
either unmuzzled, unleashed, or unattended by its owner or a member of its
owner's family, in a vicious or terrorizing manner, approached any person in an
apparent attitude of attack upon streets, sidewalks, any public grounds or
places, or private property not owned or controlled by the owner.
      5.   No dog shall be deemed "vicious" if it bites, attacks, or menaces a
trespasser on the property of its owner, anyone assaulting its owner, anyone
who has tormented or abused the dog or its offspring, or is a professionally
trained dog used for law enforcement or guard duties.
   (B)   Definition Of Owner: For the purposes of this chapter, "owner" is
defined as any person having a right of property in an animal, or who keeps or
harbors an animal, or who has it in his care, or acts as its custodian.
   (C)   Possession Illegal: It shall be unlawful for any person to keep,
harbor, or in any way possess within the corporate limits of the village a
vicious dog, unless the dog is spayed or neutered, and unless the dog is
licensed and confined as provided by this chapter.
   (D)   Identification Of Vicious Dogs: Any law enforcement officer or animal
control officer employed by or under contract with the village or Woodford
County who suspects that a dog may be vicious within the meaning of this
section may conduct an investigation to determine whether or not the dog has
committed any act or displays any characteristics which qualify it as a vicious
dog. If upon the completion of such investigation the officer concludes that
the dog is a vicious dog, such officer shall issue a written notice of
determination which includes at least the following:
      1.   A description of the dog;
      2.   Information available concerning the ownership of the dog;
      3.   A statement or conclusion that the dog is a vicious dog within the
meaning of this section;
      4.   A description of the acts or characteristics which led the officer
to conclude that the dog is a vicious dog;
      5.   Notice to the owner that the vicious dog must be licensed and
confined in accordance with the requirements of this chapter;
      6.   Notice that the owner may appeal the determination of the officer to
the village president within seven (7) working days after the determination is

This notice of determination shall be served on the owner by certified mail
from the village clerk or the "code official" (as designated in section
7-4-13 of this code) to the last known address of the owner or by personal
service from the officer or any person authorized by law to make personal
service. If the owner cannot be served or refuses service after a reasonable
attempt to do so, service can be obtained by regular mail or by posting the
notice of determination on the front door of the owner's residence.
   (E)   Appeal Of A Determination That A Dog Is A Vicious Dog:
      1.   The owner may appeal the determination that the owner's dog is a
vicious dog. An appeal must be in writing and directed to the village
president, and it must be filed by the owner with the village clerk at the
village hall within seven (7) days after receipt of the notice of determination
which identifies the dog as a vicious dog. Should the owner fail to appeal the
determination within seven (7) days, the determination of the investigating
officer that the dog is a vicious dog shall become final. Upon receipt of an
appeal, the village president, or such person as the village president may
designate to act on the village president's behalf, shall convene a hearing for
the purpose of determining whether the dog in question is a vicious dog.
      2.   The hearing shall be held within no less than five (5) nor more than
ten (10) business days after the village president or his designee provides
written notice of the time, date and location of the hearing upon the owner at
the owner's last known address. The hearing shall be conducted informally and
shall remain open to the public. At the hearing, the owner shall have the
opportunity to present evidence to explain why the dog should not be declared a
vicious dog. The owner shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel
at the owner's expense. The officer who made the initial determination that the
dog is vicious, and any other persons having knowledge of the facts and
circumstances, may be heard by the village president or his designee. All
witnesses at the hearing shall be subject to cross examination by the owner,
village representatives, or either party's attorney. If an appeal has been
properly requested, the village president or his designee shall hold this
hearing and decide all issues related to the appeal regardless of whether the
owner appears at the hearing. Evidence regarding the determination of whether a
dog is a vicious dog may include any acts or incidents involving the dog after
the events that lead to the issuance of the notice of determination up to the
time of the hearing.
      3.   Within five (5) business days after the conclusion of the hearing,
the village president or his designee shall determine whether or not the dog is
a vicious dog within the meaning of this section. The village president or his
designee shall notify the owner in writing of its determination. The decision
of the village president or his designee shall be final.
      4.   If any officer of the village, including a law enforcement officer
or an animal control officer, determines that the public safety requires the

designee in accordance with the procedures established hereinabove for the

shall be automatically revoked upon the second violation by the licensee of any
provision of this section. In the event of a revocation of the license, the
license fee shall be retained by the village and the vicious dog must be
removed from the village within forty eight (48) hours.
   (I)   Confinement Of Vicious Dogs: No person shall possess any vicious dog
unless the vicious dog is confined in accordance with this section. No vicious
dog may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or structure that
would allow the vicious dog to exit the structure on its own volition. No
vicious dog shall be kept in a house or structure when the windows are open or
when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the
vicious dog from exiting the structure. The owner of a vicious dog shall keep
the dog securely confined at all times in a locked pen, locked fenced yard, or
other locked enclosure while on the premises of the owner. The owner shall
display in a conspicuous manner, a sign on his or her premises warning that
there is a vicious dog on the premises. This sign shall be visible and legible
from the road. When the vicious dog is off such premises, the owner shall keep
the dog:
      1.   On a leash or tether not more than five feet (5') long having a
minimum tensile strength of at least three hundred (300) pounds; or
      2.   In a locked pen, or other locked enclosure (i.e., car or truck).
   (J)   Impoundment Of Dogs: A dog shall be impounded for any grounds
enumerated in this subsection by any law enforcement officer or animal control
officer employed by or under contract with the village or Woodford County;
provided, however, that if any law enforcement officer or animal control
officer reasonably believes that such dog poses an immediate threat of severe
injury to any person or domestic animal, such officials are authorized to kill
such dog. Grounds for impoundment include:
      1.   The dog has previously been determined to be a "vicious dog"; and
         (a)   The vicious dog is not confined as provided by subsection (I) of
this section or is running at large; or
         (b)   The owner of a vicious dog has not obtained or applied for a
license within forty eight (48) hours of any determination under this section
that the dog is a vicious dog.
      2.   Whether or not the dog was previously determined to be a vicious
dog:
         (a)   Without provocation, the dog has attacked, bitten or killed a
domestic animal; or
         (b)   The dog was used or possessed for the purposes of dogfighting;
or
         (c)   Without provocation, the dog has attacked, bitten, or killed a
person.
Upon impoundment of a dog, the owner of the dog shall be served notice of
impoundment in the same manner as provided in subsection (D) of this section.
The notice will state whether the dog is subject to redemption or destruction.
The notice will state that all dogs subject to redemption and not redeemed
within fourteen (14) days are subject to destruction. If the dog is not subject
to redemption, the notice shall state that appeal or review of the proposed
destruction must be sought in the circuit court of Woodford County within
fourteen (14) days of receipt of the notice. If the dog is subject to
redemption, but the dog has not been previously determined to be a vicious dog,
notice shall also be given pursuant to subsection (D) of this section that the
dog has been determined to be a vicious dog. If the owner of a dog subject to
redemption appeals the determination that the dog is a vicious dog pursuant to
subsection (E) of this section, and the village president or his designee
determines that the dog is not a vicious dog, the dog shall be released to its
owner without cost, except that the cost of keeping the dog during impoundment
can be assessed to the owner of any dog, vicious or not, found running at
large. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to allow an owner to
appeal a determination that a dog is a vicious dog, if the dog was determined
to be vicious after a previous appeal, or if the owner previously failed to
file a timely appeal of a determination that the dog was a vicious dog.
   (K)   Redemption Of An Impounded Dog:
      1.   Unless a dog is ineligible for redemption under this subsection, an
owner of a vicious dog holding a license pursuant to this section may redeem an
impounded vicious dog subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   Proof of a valid license issued by the village under subsection
(F) of this section; and
         (b)   Payment of all costs of keeping the vicious dog during the
period of impoundment.
      2.   If the owner of a dog otherwise subject to redemption fails to
redeem the impounded dog within fourteen (14) days of receiving notice of
impoundment, the dog shall be subject to destruction, provided no dog otherwise
subject to redemption shall be destroyed pending appeal, pursuant to subsection
(E) of this section, of a determination that the dog is a vicious dog. Nothing
in this subsection shall be construed to allow an owner to appeal a
determination that a dog is a vicious dog, if the dog was determined to be
vicious after a previous appeal, or if the owner previously failed to file a
timely appeal of a determination that the dog was a vicious dog.
      3.   An impounded dog shall not be subject to redemption, but shall be
subject to humane destruction, if:
         (a)   Whether or not the dog had previously been determined to be a
vicious dog, the dog causes severe injury, disfigurement or death in an
unprovoked attack on a person; or
         (b)   Subsequent to having been determined, pursuant to this section,
to be a vicious dog, the vicious dog has, without provocation, attacked or
bitten a person on one or more occasions; or
         (c)   Subsequent to having been determined, pursuant to this section,
to be a vicious dog, the vicious dog has, without provocation, killed a
domestic animal on one or more occasions; or
         (d)   Whether or not the dog had previously been determined to be a
vicious dog, the dog was used, with the knowledge or consent of its owner, for
dogfighting.
   (L)   Destruction Of Dogs: A dog that has been impounded, and: 1) has not
been redeemed by its owner, or 2) is not subject to redemption, shall be
destroyed in a humane fashion, no sooner than fourteen (14) days after its
owner has received actual notice of impoundment, provided:
      1.   If the dog is otherwise subject to redemption, and the owner is
appealing, pursuant to subsection (E) of this section a determination that the

such a condition as to allow or permit the discharge of stormwater, surface
water or groundwater into a building drain, building sewer or public sanitary
sewer, either directly through a direct connection or indirectly by discharging
or permitting the discharge of such water in or near areas of gravel, crushed
rock or other porous soil or material located near or around openings, holes,
cracks, loose joints or other gaps in a building drain, building sewer or
public sanitary sewer;
         (b)   A private combined sewer;
         (c)   A stormwater, surface water or groundwater collection or
diversion device, including, without limitation, the following: area drains,
yard drains, footing tiles, downspout, leaders, stormwater, surface water or
groundwater sump pumps or other pumping device, which is constructed or in such
a condition so as to discharge or permit or allow the discharge of stormwater,
surface water or groundwater into a building drain, building sewer or public
sanitary sewer either directly through a direct connection or indirectly by
discharging or permitting the discharge of such water in or near areas of
gravel, crushed rock or other porous soil or material located near or around
openings, holes, cracks, loose joints or other gaps in a building drain,
building sewer or public sanitary sewer;
         (d)   A building drain or building sewer with broken, missing or
cracked tiles, loose or separated joints or other holes, cracks, gaps or
spaces;
         (e)   Any other fixture, structure or condition which permits or
allows or is in such a condition to permit or allow stormwater, surface water
or groundwater to enter directly or indirectly a building drain, building sewer
or public sanitary sewer.
      2.   The superintendent of public works may give notification of the
existence of such a condition described in subsection (B)1 of this section
either personally or by certified mail to the owner of record of the property
on which such a condition is located or to the person who last paid local real
estate taxes on such property and upon the giving or mailing of such
notification, the property owner shall be deemed to have received notice of the
existence of such a condition.
      3.   The notification provided in subsection (B)2 of this section shall
be given if one or more of the following occurs:
         (a)   An on-site visual or physical inspection of the property
indicates the existence of a condition described in subsection (B)1 of this
section;
         (b)   A "dye test" indicates that water or dye placed in stormwater,
surface water or groundwater collection or diversion devices or in the ground
near the foundation of a building or structure located on such property enters
the public sanitary sewer;
         (c)   A "smoke test" indicates that smoke placed into the public
sanitary sewer under pressure is escaping through the ground or through
downspouts, leaders, gutters, yard drains, area drains or other stormwater
collection or diversion devices located on the owner's property.
      4.   The superintendent of public works is authorized to develop material
describing the testing procedures set forth in this section and indicating the
manner in which such tests shall be conducted.
      5.   Any person to whom such notification is given may appeal the
determination of the superintendent of public works to the water and sewer
committee of the village by delivering to the village board, within ten (10)
days from the date such notification is given, a "notice of appeal" detailing
the circumstances, grounds or reasons why the property owner believes that the
determination of the superintendent of public works is incorrect or inaccurate.
      6.   The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice,

tiles, downspouts, leaders, stormwater or groundwater pumps, or other pumping
devices may be directed into a gutter in a village street through an existing
opening in the curb in existence on or before October 1, 2009. Any such
existing use of an existing opening in the curb will be allowed to continue
until such time as a new sidewalk or the replacement curb is installed at which
time no holes or openings will be permitted in either the new sidewalk or the
replacement curb. If such existing opening in the curb allows water to stand in
the immediately adjacent curb and gutter area in a village street for more than
four (4) days after a storm or rainfall, this standing water and use of the
existing opening in the curb will be declared a nuisance, and the use of the
existing opening in the curb must be discontinued by the property owner within
thirty (30) days after receiving written notice from a village official that
the use of the existing opening in the curb is creating a nuisance in this
section. After October 1, 2009, no property owner may direct stormwater,
surface water, or groundwater from area drains, footing tiles, downspouts,
leaders, stormwater or groundwater pumps, or other pumping devices into a
gutter in a village street by creating a hole or opening in the curb or placing
a drainage pipe such that it drains directly into a village street. After
October 1, 2009, property owners shall not be permitted to create any holes or
openings in a curb along a village street for any purpose, except when
authorized by the village for purposes of creating or expanding driveway access
for the property.
      2.   For residential properties, the proper way to discharge stormwater,
surface water, or groundwater would be to use one of the following methods:
         (a)   Into the grass or lawn on the homeowner's property;
         (b)   Direct connection from the homeowner's property to the village
stormwater sewer system;
         (c)   A natural waterway, drainage ditch, or creek adjacent to the
homeowner's property; or
         (d)   A dry well or sump on the homeowner's property.
      3.   It is unlawful for any person owning property located within the
village to permit the discharge of stormwater, surface water, or groundwater
from a downspout, a sump pump or other pumping device, or any other storm water
diversion device, equipment, or fixture onto adjacent property such that the
discharged water is directed at, into, or immediately next to a primary or
accessory building on the neighboring property in a manner that the discharged
water flows into, onto, or immediately next to the building on the neighboring
property or otherwise negatively impacts the building on the neighboring
property. As set forth herein, the term "building" shall be defined as set
forth in the village's zoning regulations as set forth in Title 11 of the
Village Code and shall additionally include any attached improvements to the
building, including, but not limited to, a patio, porch, deck, or carport.

existence of such a condition described in subsection (C)3 of this section
either personally or by certified mail to the owner of record of the property
that is discharging stormwater, surface water, or groundwater in a manner that
violates this subsection (C)3 or to the person who last paid local real estate
taxes on such property, and upon the giving or mailing of such notification,
the property owner shall be deemed to have received notice of the existence of
such a condition that violates this subsection (C)3.
         (b)   The notification provided in this subsection shall be given if
an on-site visual or physical inspection of the property indicates the
existence of a condition described in this subsection (C)3.
         (c)   Any person to whom such notification is given may appeal the
determination of the superintendent of public works to the water and sewer
committee of the village by delivering to the village board, within ten (10)
days from the date such notification is given, a "notice of appeal" detailing
the circumstances, grounds, or reasons why the property owner believes that the
determination of the superintendent of public works is incorrect or inaccurate.
         (d)   The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such
notice, permanently cease all violations.
         (e)   This provision shall not apply to stormwater, surface water, or
groundwater that flows from one property onto or into an adjacent property
along a naturally occurring path for such water drainage.
   (D)   Violation; Fine Specified: Any person violating the provisions of this
chapter or permitting such a violation to remain beyond the period of time
provided for voluntary correction or elimination thereof, shall, upon
conviction, be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than
seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each violation. A separate offense
shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which a violation occurs or
continues.

8-5-18: WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM PROTECTION:
   (A)   Backflow Prevention Devices Required: If in accordance with the
Illinois plumbing code or in the judgment of the chairman of the water and
sewer committee, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the
safety of the public water supply system, the chairman of the water and sewer
committee will give notice to the water customer to install such an approved
device immediately. The water customer shall, at his own expense, purchase the
backflow prevention device from the village or acquire a village designated
backflow prevention device. The superintendent of public works shall maintain a
list of approved and acceptable backflow prevention devices by manufacturer
name and model number. In order to comply with this section, the water customer
must install a backflow prevention device set forth on the list maintained by
the village. The water customer will be responsible for any costs associated
with removing and replacing a backflow prevention device not included on the
list of approved and accepted devices maintained by the village. The water
customer shall also, at his own expense, install such an approved device at a
location and in a manner in accordance with the Illinois plumbing code and all
applicable local regulations, and shall have inspections and tests made of such
approved devices as required by the Illinois plumbing code and local
regulations. After such device has been installed, inspected, and approved by
the village, the village shall maintain such device as part of the village's
water supply system.
   (B)   Approval Of Private Water Supply System: No person shall establish or
permit to be established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection
whereby a private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular
public water supply of the village enters the supply or distribution system of
the municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and
the method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
village and the Illinois environmental protection agency.
   (C)   Investigation Of Industrial Properties: It shall be the duty of the
chairman of the water and sewer committee to cause surveys and investigations
to be made of industrial and other properties served by the public water supply
to determine whether actual or potential hazards to the public water supply may
exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of public record
and shall be repeated at least every two (2) years unless a licensed plumber
has installed a backflow preventer device on the industrial property, or
annually if an irrigation system has been installed on the property. Records of
such surveys shall be maintained and available for review for a period of at
least five (5) years.
   (D)   Right Of Entry For Cross Connection Control Inspection: The approved
cross connection control device inspector shall have the right to enter at any
reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water supply
or distribution system of the village for the purpose of verifying the presence
or absence of cross connections, and the superintendent of public works or his
authorized agent shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any
property served by a connection to the public water supply or distribution
system of the village for the purpose of verifying information submitted by the
customer regarding the required cross connection control inspection. On demand
the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the
chairman of the water and sewer committee any information which he may request
regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such property. The
refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the
chairman of the water and sewer committee, be deemed evidence of the presence
of improper connections as provided in this chapter.
   (E)   Discontinue Water Service For Violation: The chairman of the water and
sewer committee of the village is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
chapter is known to exist, which includes the installation of a backflow
prevention device that is not included on the village list of approved and
accepted devices, and to take such other precautionary measures as he may deem
necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water supply
distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored until
such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the
provisions of this chapter, and until a reconnection fee of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) is paid to the village. Immediate disconnection with verbal
notice can be effected when the chairman of the water and sewer committee is
assured that imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water
supply system exists. Such action shall be followed by written notification of
the cause of disconnection.
   (F)   Responsibility For Cost Of Cleanup: The consumer responsible for back
siphoned material or contamination through backflow, if contamination of the
potable water supply system occurs through an illegal cross connection or an
improperly installed, maintained or repaired device, or a device which has been
bypassed, must bear the cost of cleanup of the potable water supply system.
   (G)   Maximum Tap Line: The maximum tap line for a residence into the
village water line is a one inch (1") tap line. No tap line to a residence of
any type, single-family or multiple-family, may exceed one inch (1") unless
specific written permission by variance is given by the board of trustees of
the village. (Ord. 2015-12, 8-3-2015)

interconnection of the water taken from the well with the public water system.
   (D)   Water Meter Required: All wells will be required to be metered and the
owner required to pay the appropriate monthly fee to the village if it is
determined by the village that the water from the well is being discharged into
the sanitary sewer system. This subsection is retroactive and will apply to all
existing wells.
   (E)   Existing Wells: All wells currently in operation on the date of the
adoption of these policies will be required to obtain a permit, but they will
be exempted from all requirements except subsection (D) of this section. (Ord.

repair work or any type of work at any time on any water or sewer line on his
property and as a result said work, maintenance, etc., causes any type of
damage or malfunction on water and sewer lines of the village which are not
located on his property, and such damage to the water and sewer lines can be
established by the village engineer of the village, then the cost of repair for
such damage to such water and sewer lines occasioned by the action of the
property owner shall be assessed to the property owner and a bill for such
costs shall be sent to him. If that charge is not paid within sixty (60) days
of the receipt of the bill, then the village will take whatever legal action is

8-6-17: JURY SWORN:
The jury shall appear and be sworn, or affirmed, by such proper officer,
faithfully and impartially to assess the damages of each of the owners
specified in such certificate, or those of them to be adjusted, according to
law to the best of their judgment and understanding, and all parties in
interest shall be entitled to subpoenas, and other writs and papers, and
changes of venue may be had, and the trial shall be conducted as in other civil
cases.
8-6-18: HEAR EVIDENCE:
The jury shall hear such lawful evidence touching the question of such damages
as may be presented to them, and shall also on request of the said Board; or
owners of land whose damages are to be determined, in a body visit and examine
the proposed location, alteration, widening or vacation of such street, alley
or avenue, and the lands to be taken and affected thereby, and make a written
verdict, specifying the amount of damages, if any, which each such owner shall
recover, and return the same to such proper officer, to be by him entered upon
his docket in the nature of a judgment, to be paid by the said Board, together

street, alley or avenue, of which meeting said Board shall give public notice,
by causing not less than three (3) notices thereof to be posted at public
places within the Village, at least five (5) days prior thereto.
8-6-21: REVOKE PROCEEDINGS:
In cases where the damages are not wholly released or agreed upon, and the
Board shall be of the opinion that the damages assessed by the jury are
manifestly too high, and the payment of the same would be an unreasonable
burden upon the Village, the Board may revoke all proceedings had upon the
petition by a written order to that effect, and such revocation shall have the
effect to annul all such proceedings, and the assessments, releases and
agreements, in respect to damages, growing out of the proceedings upon the

village and resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after
notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional
application fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application
within thirty (30) days after the applicant resubmits the application, or it is
deemed approved. Failure to resubmit a revised application within thirty (30)
days of the denial shall require the applicant to submit a new application with
applicable fees, and recommencement of the village's review period.
         (4)   The applicant must notify the village in writing of its
intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis,
which may be submitted with the resubmitted application.

village makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small
wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the
collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application
submitted two (2) or more years after the effective date of the Act, by

the village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its
option under this division.

facility through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
   2.   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village within
thirty (30) days of the sale or transfer of a small wireless facility within

documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.

coverage and limit requirement required by the village. A wireless provider
that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to
comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this
section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage limits required by the village.

having and maintaining net unrestricted assets of at least one hundred million
dollars ($100,000,000.00), as determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting methods consistently applied, while maintaining appropriate loss
reserves for the amount of self-insurance obligations established in this

removed by the owner, lessee, or other person or entity in control of the
premises on which the sign is located according to the following schedule: a)
the sign shall be removed and replaced with a blank face no later than sixty
(60) days after the sign was abandoned, the sign ceased to be used, or the

times in good and safe structural condition. Uncovered parking spaces shall not
be closer than three feet (3') to any street right of way. Any lawful parking
areas and accessways existing at the effective date of the adoption of the
amendment to the zoning code that adopted this provision of the zoning code,
which would not be permitted under the terms of this provision of the zoning
code, or subsequent amendment thereto, is declared to be a legal nonconforming
parking area and accessway. Although property owners are encouraged to comply
with the provisions of this section, any such nonconforming parking area and
accessway shall remain a legal nonconforming use subject to the conditions and
provisions set forth in chapter 11 of this title. Furthermore, in addition to
the conditions and provisions set forth in section
10-11-3 of this title, any changes or reconfiguration made to: 1) a legal
nonconforming use under this section, other than routine maintenance and
upkeep, or 2) the exterior footprint of the main structure on the property upon
which the legal nonconforming use exists, shall terminate the legal
nonconforming use and the requirements of this section must be met for the
changed or reconfigured portion of the parking area or accessway. Additionally,
if the main structure on the property upon which the legal nonconforming use
under this section exists is substantially destroyed by any means to an extent
of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at the time of
destruction, such legal nonconforming use shall terminate and the requirements
of this section must be met for the parking area or accessway on the affected
property.
   (F)   All accessways for residential districts shall comply with the
provisions of section
8-1-9 of this code. All parking areas and accessways in residential districts
shall be clearly marked or defined for use as a parking area or accessway.
   (G)   The parking area and accessways shall be installed and available for
use prior to the establishment of the use of any parcel or lot. Also, parking
areas and accessways shall be properly maintained at all times in good and safe
structural condition for vehicular and pedestrian traffic and shall not emit
dust in a manner that affects adjacent or neighboring properties.
   (H)   Any lighting for the parking area shall be arranged and maintained so
that the light does not shine directly upon any adjacent property or street and
does not produce excessive glare.
   (I)   An adequate paved accessway for pedestrian traffic from each structure
or use to the parking area, street, or alley shall be provided. (Ord. 2005-09,

zoning code or any subsequent amendment thereto that could not be built under
terms of this zoning code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or sign, or its
location on the lot, such structure or sign may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No such structure or sign may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity.
   (B)   Should such structure or sign be destroyed by any means to an extent
of more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of destruction
then it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of
this zoning code. A building designed for a nonconforming use, however, may be
constructed or altered beyond the limitations herein provided by action of the
zoning board after public hearing, as required by law in case of variances.

zoning code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this zoning
code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (B)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this zoning code, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   (C)   If a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of one year
or more, it shall not be reestablished, unless the nonconforming use was in a
building designed, arranged and intended for such use.
   (D)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, on which or in
which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located
and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
   (E)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in

be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it
is located.
   (F)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in

code. (Ord. 2005-04, 5-16-2005)
10-11-7: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE:

to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the current replacement value
of the building, provided that the cubical content of the building as it
existed at the time of passage or amendment of this zoning code shall not be
increased.
Nothing in this zoning code shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any village official charged with protecting the public safety, upon

10-12-1: DECLARATION OF POLICY:
In general, use of land and buildings in the village is substantially uniform
in relation to the adjacent use of land and buildings within the different
zoned areas of the village. It is hereby recognized that special uses may
exist, which by their unique characteristics, cannot be classified in a
particularly zoned area. Thus, the policy and purpose of this chapter is to
provide a flexible means of permitting certain exceptions to the zoning
districts established under this title when certain conditions exist to warrant
such special use. In the case of a permissible special use that would otherwise
be an exception to the zoning rules and regulations adopted herein, the public
benefit of such special use outweighs the potential harm to the public welfare
and to the adjacent property owners under such conditions imposed as are
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and individual
property rights of adjacent property owners. (Ord. 2004-16, 9-7-2004)
10-12-2: DEFINITION:
A "special use" is a use, which by its unique characteristics and nature, is
necessary or desirable for the public welfare, but which is potentially
incompatible with the uses normally permitted in the zoning districts
established under this title. (Ord. 2004-16, 9-7-2004)
10-12-3: APPLICATION/NOTICE OF HEARING:
An application for a special use permit may be filed by any person having a
freehold interest in a parcel of property, or a possessory interest entitled to
exclusive possession (with the concurrence of the person holding the freehold
interest), or a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, or
an exclusive possessory interest which is otherwise specifically enforceable.
An applicant must submit a special use permit application or petition with all
necessary supporting documentation, including a map or diagram with
measurements and specifications, to the zoning officer at least twenty one (21)
days prior to the zoning board meeting at which the application will be
considered by the zoning board. The applicant must also submit payment of any
required fees or costs with the application.
The special use permit application form shall be available at the village hall
during regular business hours or from the zoning officer. The special use
permit application shall be in a form as established by the zoning board, which
shall include: a) the name and address of applicant and owner, b) the location
of property for which the special use is being sought, c) a description of the
specific special use being sought, d) facts sufficient to demonstrate that the
conditions and standards set forth in this chapter have been met, and e) plans,
data, maps, and documents necessary for the proper understanding of the
application. The zoning officer shall provide a copy of the application and
supporting materials to each zoning board member at least seven (7) days prior
to the zoning board meeting when the application will be considered.
Upon receipt of a special use permit application, the zoning officer shall set
the public hearing on the application on the agenda for the next appropriate
zoning board meeting. The zoning officer shall assist the applicant in causing
notice of the hearing to be published at least once, not more than thirty (30)
days and not less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in the "Woodford
County Journal", Roanoke-Benson edition, which is circulated in the village of
Roanoke. The notice shall set forth the date, time, and place of this hearing,
and shall include a description of the particular location for requested
special use and a brief statement describing the requested special use. The
applicant shall pay the publication cost for this notice in addition to the
special use permit application fee.
The applicant shall additionally provide notice of the public hearing to all
property owners located within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the subject
property for which the special use is being requested. This notice shall be
personally served on said property owner. If personal service cannot be made on
a particular property owner, this notice may be mailed to the property owner by
certified mail, return receipt requested.
If an applicant or other interested party requests a special meeting of the
zoning board to review a special use permit application or to hold a public
hearing thereon, then the cost of said special meeting shall be paid by such
requesting person. This cost shall include the salary of each zoning board
member and the zoning officer for attending the special meeting. (Ord. 2004-16,
9-7-2004)
10-12-4: PERMITTED USES OF ADJACENT PROPERTY:
Neither the nonconforming or special use of, or a variance granted for,
neighboring lands or structures in the same district or the permitted use of
lands or structures in other districts shall be considered as justification or
grounds by the village board for the issuance of a special use permit. As such,
these other nonconforming or special uses, variances, or permitted uses shall
not establish a precedent for granting a future or similar special use. (Ord.
2004-16, 9-7-2004)
10-12-5: STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL USE PERMITS:
No special use may be authorized by the zoning board unless, in accordance with
the procedures and requirement set forth in this chapter, the zoning board
makes the following findings:
   (A)   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare;
   (B)   That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
   (C)   That the special use conforms to the applicable regulations and
standards of, and preserves the essential character of, the district in which
it may be located;
   (D)   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district and will not be in conflict with the village's
comprehensive plans for development;
   (E)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
   (F)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
and
   (G)   That the special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the village board pursuant to
the recommendations of the zoning board. (Ord. 2004-16, 9-7-2004)
10-12-6: HEARING PROCEDURES:
   (A)   The chairman (or acting chairman) of the zoning board shall announce
the public hearing on the special use.
   (B)   A summary of the special use shall be provided to the zoning board and
the public by the chairman of the zoning board or his designee, which shall
include whether proof of publication of the notice for the hearing has been
provided and a brief description of both the property and the requested special
use.
   (C)   The applicant for the special use shall then be permitted to describe
the requested special use and provide any evidence, including testimony of
witnesses, to support the special use permit request.
   (D)   At the conclusion of the presentation of the special use request by
the applicant, the chairman shall allow public comment, including evidence and
testimony from any opposition to the special use request. Furthermore, any
parties opposing the special use request shall be allowed to cross examine any
testimony provided by the applicant, and the applicant may likewise cross
examine any testimony provided by the opposing party. The chairman may limit
opposing parties to one or more representatives during the hearing when
appropriate for the proper and efficient conduct of the meeting.
   (E)   During the presentation of evidence and comment in support of or
against the special use request, the chairman may allow zoning board members to
also ask questions or make comment as the chairman determines to be
appropriate.

administer oaths to all witnesses testifying at the hearing and may compel
attendance of witnesses at the hearing.
   (H)   The zoning board may, by majority vote, postpone or adjourn from time
to time any public hearing on the special use application. In the event of such
postponement or adjournment, further publication of such action need not be
made. Furthermore, if the zoning board does postpone or adjourn the public
hearing, no additional costs shall be assessed against the applicant or other
interested party for any subsequent meetings. (Ord. 2004-16, 9-7-2004)
10-12-7: ZONING BOARD ACTION:
The zoning board shall make a report to the village board on the special use
application and the public hearing held to review the special use application.
The zoning board shall make a recommendation to the village board on the
special use request upon the concurring vote of a majority of the zoning board
members present provided a quorum exists to conduct the hearing. Within thirty
(30) days after the close of the public hearing on a special use application,
the zoning board shall make their report and recommendation to the village
board.
The zoning board may also recommend that reasonable conditions, safeguards, and
restrictions be imposed by the village board if it grants the application for
special use permit in order to protect the neighboring properties or the public
health, safety, and welfare, or to otherwise carry out the general purposes and
intent of this title. (Ord. 2004-16, 9-7-2004)
10-12-8: VILLAGE BOARD ACTION:
   (A)   Zoning Board Report: The village board shall not act upon a special
use permit application until the village board has received the written report
and recommendation from the zoning board.
   (B)   Evaluation Of Special Use Application: As provided herein, the village
board shall not be bound by the findings or recommendations of the zoning
board. Accordingly, the village board may make findings of fact different from
the zoning board's findings based upon the evidence received at the public
hearing in front of the zoning board. Also, the village board may further
discuss the positions of the applicant and any opposing parties with these
parties during their evaluation of the special use application.
   (C)   Adoption Of Recommendation: The village board may adopt the
recommendation of the zoning board on a special use request upon the concurring
vote of a majority of all village board members. However, the village board can
only take action that is adverse to the zoning board's recommendation on a
special use request by a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all village
board members.
   (D)   Use Contingent On Conditions Or Restrictions: The village board may
grant a special use contingent upon the acceptance of certain conditions,
safeguards, or restrictions as imposed by the zoning board, which may be
modified or added by the village board, to protect public welfare or the
neighboring property or carry out the general purposes and intent of this
title. These conditions or restrictions shall be set forth in writing. Such
conditions or restrictions may include or address, without limitation,
landscape screening, fencing, hours of operation, lighting, noise levels,
parking facilities, accessibility, signage, outdoor storage, expansion, and
other such conditions or restrictions deemed necessary to render the use
compatible with the surrounding properties.
   (E)   Written Protest Or Opposition To Special Use Request: If a written
protest or petition against any special use request is:
      1.   Signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the
frontage to the subject parcel; or
      2.   Signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the
frontage to the subject parcel immediately adjoining or across an alley from
the frontage; or
      3.   Signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the
frontage to the subject parcel directly opposite from the frontage;
and properly filed with the village clerk pursuant to this section, the special
use request shall not be approved except by the favorable vote of two-thirds
(2/3) of all village board members. In order to properly file a written protest
or opposing petition, a person must submit the written protest or opposing
petition to the zoning officer prior to the public hearing being held by the
zoning board to review of the special use application, with a copy also being
provided to the village clerk at that time. This provision shall supersede any
other voting requirements established by this chapter.
   (F)   Permit Term: A special use permit granted by the village board shall
remain valid until the beginning of the next fiscal year for the village (the
subsequent May 1) up to one calendar year from the date when the special use
permit was granted by the village board, unless the special use is otherwise
terminated under the provisions of this chapter.
   (G)   Requirements To Begin Use Of Property: If a special use request has
been approved by the village board pursuant to this chapter, the person who
made the special use request must begin use of the property as allowed by the
special use permit or begin construction consistent with the allowed special
use within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date when special use permit
was granted by the village board. Failure to comply with this one hundred
twenty (120) day requirement for any reason shall result in automatic
revocation of the special use permit. If a special use permit is revoked, the
person making the special use request must submit a new application and pay all
related fees in order to gain further approval of the special use. The approval
of the initial special use request shall have no effect and shall be no
guarantee of approval of a subsequent similar special use request. (Ord. 2004-
16, 9-7-2004)
10-12-9: RENEWAL:
Each special use permit granted hereunder shall be valid until the beginning of
the next fiscal year (the subsequent May 1). Thereafter, the special use permit
may be renewed for a one year period, said year to coincide with the fiscal
year of the village. Thus, after the initial approval of a special use permit
by the village board, every special use permit must be renewed annually by the
zoning board, with such decision being made in the discretion of the zoning
board. The person granted the special use permit, or such successor in interest
to the subject parcel of property for which the special use is granted, shall
make the application for renewal of the special use permit and shall pay the
annual renewal fee. The zoning officer shall provide renewal notices to all
special use permit holders prior to each new fiscal year, and the zoning
officer shall present each special use renewal application to the zoning board
for review at the first zoning board meeting after the beginning of a new
fiscal year. (Ord. 2004-16, 9-7-2004)
10-12-10: TERMINATION OF SPECIAL USE:
Any special use authorized by the village board shall be deemed to have
automatically terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following:
   (A)   Failure to establish the special use within the required time period
set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Nonrenewal of the special use permit by the zoning board during the
annual renewal process.
   (C)   After establishment of a special use, the discontinuation of that use
for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.

after the beginning of a new renewal period.
In the event that a special use authorized with respect to any parcel of
property within the village is discontinued, abandoned, or terminated as
provided in this section, the only uses which may be established on that parcel
are the permitted uses authorized under the zoning regulations applicable to
that parcel or any special use authorized by the village board which has not
been terminated, discontinued, or abandoned in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter. (Ord. 2004-16, 9-7-2004)

permit and the use applied for conform to the applicable regulations and
standards of this title, the zoning officer shall issue a zoning use permit. A

shall provide written notice to the applicant of the expiration together with
notice that further work as described on the canceled permit shall not proceed
until a new permit shall have been issued; provided, however, that for
commercial and industrial buildings, the permit shall extend for such period as
set forth in the application for the zoning use permit as the time necessary to
complete the building up to a maximum of two (2) years. Any delay in providing
any notice under this provision shall not extend the expiration date of the
zoning use permit.
      3.   If a new zoning use permit is issued granting additional time for
completion of the work, such new permit may require, at the discretion of the

shall not, in any case, be valid after three hundred sixty five (365)
consecutive days from the date of issuance thereof.

notify the zoning officer when the building, structure, or land is ready for
occupation or use as set forth in application form.
   (C)   Zoning compliance certificates for the use of vacant land shall be

10-13-6: VARIANCES:
The zoning board, after public hearing and after following the procedures set
forth in this section, may grant a variance to the regulations and standards of
this title relating to the construction or alteration of structures when in
harmony with the general purposes and intent of this title only in the specific
situations set forth in this section. In doing so, the zoning board shall make
written findings of fact in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in this
section and must find that practical difficulties or particular hardships exist
which prevent compliance with the strict letter of the regulations or standards
of this title.
   (A)   Submission Of Application/Notice Of Hearing: An application for a
variance may be filed by any person having a freehold interest in a parcel of
property, or a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession (with the
concurrence of the person holding the freehold interest), or a contractual
interest which may become a freehold interest, or an exclusive possessory
interest which is otherwise specifically enforceable.
An applicant must submit a variance application with all necessary supporting
documentation, including a map or diagram with measurements and specifications,
to the zoning officer at least twenty one (21) days prior to the zoning board
meeting at which the application will be considered by the zoning board. The
applicant must also submit payment of any required fees or costs with the
application.
The variance application form shall be available at the village hall during
regular business hours or from the zoning officer. The variance application
shall be in a form as established by the zoning board. The zoning officer shall
provide a copy of the application and supporting materials to each zoning board
member at least seven (7) days prior to the zoning board meeting when the
application will be considered.
Upon receipt of a variance application, the zoning officer shall set the public
hearing on the application on the agenda for the next appropriate zoning board
meeting. The zoning officer shall assist the applicant in causing notice of the
hearing to be published at least once, not more than thirty (30) days and not
less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in the "Woodford County
Journal", Roanoke-Benson edition, which is circulated in the village of
Roanoke. The notice shall set forth the date, time, and place of this hearing,
and shall include a description of the particular location for requested
variance and a brief statement describing the requested variance. The applicant
shall pay the publication cost for this notice in addition to the variance
application fee.
If the subject property is located in an R-1 or R-2 residential district, the
applicant shall additionally provide notice of the public hearing to all
property owners located adjacent and contiguous to the subject property for
which the variance is being requested, which shall include property sharing a
common corner with the subject property and property only separated from the
subject property by a road, street, or alley that is otherwise adjacent and
contiguous to or shares a common corner with the subject property, and to all
other property owners located within fifty feet (50') of the subject property
for which the variance is being requested. If the subject property is located
in any other zoning district, the applicant shall provide notice of the public
hearing to all property owners located within two hundred fifty feet (250') of
the subject property for which the variance is being requested. This notice
shall be personally served on said property owner. If personal service cannot
be made on a particular property owner, this notice may be mailed to the
property owner by certified mail, return receipt requested.
If an applicant or other interested party requests a special meeting of the
zoning board to review a variance application or to hold a public hearing
thereon, then the cost of said special meeting shall be paid by such requesting
person. This cost shall include the salary of each zoning board member and the
zoning officer for attending the special meeting.
   (B)   Permitted Uses Of Adjacent Property: Neither the nonconforming or
special use of, or a variance granted for, neighboring lands or structures in
the same district or the permitted use of lands or structures in other
districts shall be considered as justification or grounds by the zoning board
for the issuance of a variance. As such, these other nonconforming or special
uses, variances, or permitted uses shall not establish a precedent for granting
a future or similar variance.
   (C)   Standards For Variances: The zoning board shall not grant a variance
pursuant to this section unless, based upon all the records and evidence, all
the following conditions have been met:
      1.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
      2.   The conditions upon which an application for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable,
generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      3.   The alleged difficulty or hardship caused by this title has not been
created by any persons presently having an interest in the property;
      4.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located;
      5.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the
public street, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood; and
      6.   The granting of the variance is in harmony with the general purposes
and intent of this title, and will not be in conflict with the village's
comprehensive plans for development.
   (D)   Authorized Variances: A variance from the regulations and requirements
of this title shall be granted by the zoning board only in accordance with the
standards established in this section and may be granted only in the following
instances as set forth below:
      1.   To permit any yard, setback, or open space requirement that is less
than the applicable yard, setback, or open space requirement;
      2.   To permit the use of a lot or adjacent lots for a use otherwise
prohibited solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots,
but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less
than ninety percent (90%) of the required area and width (e.g., the minimum lot
size in an R-1 residential district is 6,000 square feet in order for a
building to be constructed on such lot; thus, under this provision, as long as
the lot size is 5,400 square feet or more (90 percent of 6,000), a variance
would be permissible);
      3.   To reduce the applicable off street parking or loading requirements
for a specific use whenever the character or use of the structure or property
is such that it is unnecessary for the full provision of the parking or loading
facilities;
      4.   To increase by not more than twenty five percent (25%) the maximum
distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use
served;
      5.   To increase the width of driveway or curb cuts in manufacturing
districts with respect to access to parking or loading facilities;
      6.   To permit more than one driveway per residential lot;
      7.   To permit the variance in number, size (excluding height), or
location of an accessory use, accessory area, or an accessory building or
structure; and
      8.   To permit a variance in sign regulations where, due to the unique
conditions or nature of the property on which the sign is to be placed, the
regulations would be inappropriate, except such variance in the sign
regulations shall not be permitted in residential districts.
      9.   To permit a nonconforming building to be structurally altered or
reconstructed within its boundary walls to an extent exceeding, in aggregate
cost, twenty five percent (25%) of its fair market value including land value.
      10.   To permit variance of the regulations pertaining to television
discs or satellite antenna dishes.
   (E)   Hearing Procedures:
      1.   The chairman (or acting chairman) of the zoning board shall announce
the public hearing on the variance.
      2.   A summary of the variance request shall be provided to the zoning
board and the public by the chairman of the zoning board or his designee, which
shall include whether proof of publication of the notice for the hearing has
been provided and a brief description of both the property and the requested
variance.
      3.   The applicant for the variance shall then be permitted to describe
the requested variance and provide any evidence, including testimony of
witnesses, to support the variance request.
      4.   At the conclusion of the presentation of the variance request by the
applicant, the chairman shall allow public comment, including evidence and
testimony from any opposition to the variance request. Furthermore, any parties
opposing the variance request shall be allowed to cross examine any testimony
provided by the applicant, and the applicant may likewise cross examine any
testimony provided by the opposing party. The chairman may limit opposing
parties to one or more representatives during the hearing when appropriate for
the proper and efficient conduct of the meeting.
      5.   During the presentation of evidence and comment in support of or
against the variance request, the chairman may allow zoning board members to
also ask questions or make comment as the chairman determines to be
appropriate.
      6.   At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence and comment in
support of or against the variance request, the chairman shall allow the zoning
board to further discuss and deliberate on the decision to grant or deny the
variance request.
      7.   The chairman, or the acting chairman, of the zoning board shall
administer oaths to all witnesses testifying at the hearing and may compel
attendance of witnesses at the hearing.
      8.   The zoning board may only grant a variance request upon the
concurring vote of a majority of the zoning board members present provided a
quorum exists to conduct the hearing.
   (F)   Variance Request Approval: The zoning board may grant a variance
contingent upon the acceptance of certain conditions or restrictions as imposed
by the zoning board to protect neighboring property or carry out the general
purposes and intent of this title. These conditions or restrictions shall be
set forth in writing along with the zoning board's finding of fact for the
variance application.
If a variance request has been approved by the zoning board pursuant to this
section, the person who made the variance request must begin construction, or
cause construction to begin, on the project within one hundred twenty (120)
days of the date when the variance request was granted by the zoning board.
Failure to comply with this one hundred twenty (120) day requirement for any
reason shall result in automatic revocation of the variance. If a variance is
revoked, the person making the variance request must submit a new application
and pay all related fees in order to gain further approval of the variance
request. The approval of the initial variance request shall have no effect and
shall be no guarantee of approval of a subsequent similar variance request.
(Ord. 2004-16, 9-7-2004)

and the zoning officer for attending the special meeting.
   (B)   Hearing Procedures:
      1.   The chairman (or acting chairman) of the zoning board shall announce
the public hearing on the proposed zoning amendment.
      2.   A summary of the zoning amendment shall be provided to the zoning

after its next regularly scheduled meeting following the plan commission's
recommendation to review the plan commission's recommendation and decide
whether to approve or disapprove the preliminary plat and subdivision
application. The village board may adopt the recommendation of the plan
commission upon a concurring vote of a majority of all village board members.
The village board can only take action that is adverse to the plan commission
by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all board members. If the preliminary plat and
subdivision application are approved by the village board, the subdivider may
proceed with preparing the final plat. If the preliminary plat and subdivision
application are disapproved, the subdivider may make revisions in the
preliminary plat or subdivision application and resubmit the revised
preliminary plat and subdivision application for approval. The revised
preliminary plat and subdivision application must first be resubmitted for
review by the plan commission in accordance with the procedures set forth
herein for the plan commission's recommendation before further review by the
village board. However, the plan commission shall have the discretion to
determine whether a new public hearing is necessary on the revised preliminary
plat and subdivision application prior to the plan commission's review of the

preliminary plat, two (2) copies of the original preliminary plat shall be
endorsed by the village president, with one copy being provided to the
subdivider and one copy being provided to the village clerk. The village
board's conditional approval of the preliminary plat does not qualify it for
recording, but shall be construed as an expression of approval of the general
layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of the final plat and an
assurance to the subdivider that the final plat will be approved if it conforms
to the terms of the conditionally approved preliminary plat.
   (L)   Fee: The subdivision application shall be accompanied by cash, a
check, or money order, in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). Such payment

(Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-2-4: APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT:
   (A)   Within one year after conditional approval of the preliminary plat,
the subdivider shall submit the final plat and other supplementary material in
compliance with section
11-5-3 of this title, along with the appropriate fee, to the plat officer. If
the application for approval of the final plat is not submitted within this one
year period, it shall become null and void unless an extension of time is
applied for by the subdivider and granted by the village board.
   (B)   The subdivider shall complete a written application for approval of
the final plat for submission to the plan commission with the final plat. The
application form shall be available at the village hall during regular business
hours or from the plat officer. The application shall be in a form as
established by the plan commission.

plat and supplementary material specified herein and ten (10) reduced sized
copies of the main final plat, along with a written application, to the plat
officer for transmittal to the plan commission at least ten (10) working days
prior to the plan commission meeting at which the final plat and application
are to be considered by the plan commission. The final plat shall conform to
the preliminary plat as approved and it may constitute only that portion of the
approved preliminary plat which the subdivider proposes to record and develop
at the time; provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements
of this title. The subdivider may delay applying for approval of other parts of
the proposed subdivision beyond the initial one year period with approval from
the village board. If only a partial application is submitted, only the
portions receiving final approval shall be recorded.
   (D)   The plan commission shall hold a public hearing on the final plat and
application. The plat officer shall inform the subdivider of the time and place
of the hearing when the plan commission shall review the final plat. If the
subdivider or other interested party requests a special meeting of the plan
commission to review the final plat and application, then the cost of said
special meeting shall be paid by such requesting person. This cost shall
include the salary or stipend of each plan commission member and the plat
officer for attending the special meeting.
   (E)   The plat officer shall provide a copy of the application and the
preliminary plat and supporting materials to each plan commission member at
least seven (7) days prior to the plan commission meeting when the preliminary
plat and subdivision application will be considered.
   (F)   The public hearing procedures shall follow an abbreviated process
similar to the procedures set forth above for the preliminary plat and
subdivision application with same voting requirements. After the public
hearing, the plan commission shall make a recommendation to approve or
disapprove the final plat and application. The plan commission's review shall
focus on whether the final plat conforms with the preliminary plat and
subdivision application, with the technical requirements in chapters 4 and 5 of
this title, including the seal of a registered Illinois land surveyor or
engineer, and with the comprehensive plan and the official map in existence at
the time when the preliminary plat was approved. Such recommendation from the
plan commission shall be provided to the village board within seven (7) days in
writing, which shall include any findings or conditions of such recommendation,
if any.
   (G)   The village board shall review the plan commission's recommendation at
its next regularly scheduled meeting following receipt of the plan commission's
recommendation and shall decide whether to approve or disapprove the final plat
and application. The village board's review shall be confined to the same
considerations reviewed by the plan commission in accordance with the
provisions set forth in subsection (F) of this section. The review process of
the final plat and application shall not exceed sixty (60) days after
submission of the completed final plat and application unless a longer period
is mutually agreed upon by the subdivider and the village board.
   (H)   Upon the village board's approval of the final plat, four (4) copies
of the final plat shall be endorsed by the village president, with two (2)
copies being provided to the subdivider, one copy being provided to the village
clerk, and one copy being provided to the plat officer. Within ninety (90) days
after the approval of the final plat by the village board, the subdivider shall
file one copy of the final plat with the county recorder of Woodford County,
and if not so filed, it shall have no validity and shall not be recorded
without recertification by the village board. Upon demonstration of unique

cash, a check, or money order, in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). Such
payment shall be made payable to the village and provided to the plat officer,
who shall promptly provide the payment to the village collector for deposit
into the general corporate fund of the village. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-2-5: SMALL SUBDIVISIONS:
A subdivider of any proposed subdivision having fewer than five (5) lots

may, at the discretion of the plat officer, submit a subdivision application
and final plat for approval under the process set forth in section
11-2-4 of this chapter, along with any supplementary material and the
appropriate fee, without going through the steps required for the preliminary
plat set forth in section
11-2-3 of this chapter. However, the review by the plan commission and the
village board may include all aspects of the proposed subdivision (similar to
the review of a preliminary plat) rather than just the technical issues
described in the review process set forth in section
11-2-4 of this chapter. Furthermore, the village board may determine, in its
complete discretion, that the full review process as set forth in sections 11-
2-3 and 11-2-4 of this chapter must be followed. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-2-6: COMPLETION OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
The subdivider shall substantially complete construction of all public
improvements set forth in the final plat no later than two (2) years after the
village board's approval of the final plat. Upon a showing of undue hardship by
the subdivider or circumstances beyond the control of the subdivider, the
subdivider may request that the village board grant an extension of the
completion period for up to an additional one year period. Provided no danger
to the health, safety, or general welfare would be created by this extension,
the extension may be granted at the complete discretion of the village board
and upon any conditions set forth by the village board. If at the expiration of
the two (2) year completion period, or any approved extension thereof, the
public improvements have not been completed or properly installed, the village
may proceed to properly complete the public improvements utilizing the surety
bond or other financial security provided by the subdivider. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-
19-2005)
11-2-7: ACCEPTANCE OF PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS:
The approval of the final plat by the plan commission or the village board
shall not constitute acceptance by the village of any public improvements set
forth in a final plat, irrespective of any act by any officer, agent,
representative, or employee of the village with regard to the public
improvements. Upon completion of the public improvements, the subdivider shall
submit to the village a signed certification of compliance from a properly
licensed engineer that all public improvements set forth on the final plat have
been properly installed in accordance with the requirements of this title.
Provided the village board concludes that the certification of compliance is
accurate, which shall include review of the public improvements by the village
engineer, the village board shall take formal action to accept the public
improvements. If, upon the completion of the one year guarantee period set
forth in subsection
11-5-3(D) of this title, the public improvements are free of defects, the
village board shall take action to release the bond or other financial security
provided by the subdivider under subsection
11-5-3(D) of this title. The village engineer shall confirm whether the public
improvements are free of defects upon the completion of the one year guarantee
period before the village board takes any action to release the subdivider's
bond or other financial security provided under subsection
11-5-3(D) of this title. If, upon the completion of the one year guarantee
period set forth in subsection
11-5-3(D) of this title, the public improvements are not free of defects as
determined by the village engineer, the village board shall take action to
remedy such defects utilizing the surety bond or other financial security
provided by the subdivider. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-2-8: RESUBDIVISIONS:
If changes are made in any approved or recorded subdivision plat to: a) any
street layout, b) any area reserved therein for public use, or c) any lot line,
or if the changes being made to any approved or recorded subdivision plat
affect another legally recorded plat, then such changes shall be approved by
the plan commission and the village board by the same procedures, rules, and
regulations provided in this title for approval of subdivisions. (Ord. 2005-09,
12-19-2005)
11-2-9: VACATION OF PLATS:
A subdivider of any proposed subdivision may seek to vacate a plat or a portion
of a plat at any time before the sale of any lot therein by a written
instrument declaring the subdivision plat to be vacated, with a copy of the
subdivision plat attached thereto. Such vacation instrument must then be
approved by the plan commission and the village board by the same procedures,
rules, and regulations provided in this title for approval of subdivisions. The
village board may reject any vacation request if approving the vacation would
abridge or destroy any public rights in any public uses, improvements, streets,
or alleys provided in the subdivision plat. If the vacation request is properly
approved by the village board, the vacation instrument shall then be recorded
and shall thereby divest the public of any rights in any public uses,
improvements, streets, or alleys provided in or dedicated by the subdivision
plat. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)

11-6-2: Designation Of Public Sites, Open Spaces
11-6-3: Amendments Of Official Map
11-6-1: PURPOSE:
The official map is hereby made a part of this title by reference and is
intended to designate public sites and streets that may be required by the plan
commission or the village board in any proposed subdivision plats. The
designation of such public sites on final subdivision plats may be required
prior to approval provided that such public site is indicated on the official
map for fifteen (15) days prior to the date of application for final approval
of the subdivision plat. Limits to which such areas designated for public use
on the official map may be restricted from development are as specified herein.
(Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-6-2: DESIGNATION OF PUBLIC SITES, OPEN SPACES:
Whenever the requirements provided by this title, including the official map,
shall indicate the necessity for providing a school site, park site, roadway,
or street or other public lands within any proposed subdivision for which
approval has been requested, and no such provision has been made therefor, the
plan commission or the village board may require that lands be designated for
such public purpose before approving such plat. Factors that may be reviewed by
the plan commission or the village board in determining the need for such
public sites in a proposed subdivision shall include the size, scope,
population density, or other characteristics of the proposed subdivision.
Whenever a final plat of subdivision, or part thereof, has been approved by the
village board as complying with the official map and a public site is
designated therein, the subdivider shall dedicate the subdivider's
proportionate share of the land comprising the public site to the appropriate
governmental body. The village board shall determine the subdivider's
proportionate share of land to be dedicated under this provision based upon the
size and population density of the proposed subdivision. Thereafter, the
corporate authorities of the governmental body having jurisdiction over the
particular public site shall purchase the remainder of such land comprising the
designated public site, at fair market value, within one year from date of
approval of such plat, and if it does not do so within such period of one year,
the land so designated may then be used by the owners thereof in any other
manner consistent with this title, including the official map and the zoning
code. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-6-3: AMENDMENTS OF OFFICIAL MAP:
Amendments to the official map shall be made in the manner prescribed by law,
which shall include a public hearing on the proposed amendment before either
the plan commission or the village board. Any public or semipublic agency may
request the establishment of a future public site or easement on the official
map. When such proposed site is not included in the comprehensive plan, the
requesting agency shall indicate to the plan commission the need for the site
in the particular location specified. The plan commission shall study the
request and shall report to the village board as to the consistency of the
proposed site with the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)

regulation, statute, or any other provision of law, whichever provisions are
more restrictive or impose higher standards shall control.
   (B)   Private Provisions: The regulations and standards of this title are
not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement
or restriction, provided that where the provisions of these regulations and
standards are more restrictive or impose higher regulations or standards than
such easement, covenant, or any other private agreement or restriction, the
requirements of these regulations and standards shall govern. (Ord. 2005-09,
12-19-2005)
11-7-5: VALIDITY; SEVERABILITY:
   (A)   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall declare invalid the
application of any provision of this title to a particular property, structure,

declared to be invalid. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-7-6: SAVING PROVISION:
The regulations and standards of this title shall not be construed as abating
any action now pending under, or by virtue of, prior existing subdivision
regulations and standards, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering
any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any
person, firm, corporation, or other legal entity, or as waiving any right of
the village under any section or provision existing at the time of the adoption
of these regulations and standards, or as vacating or annulling any rights
obtained by any person, firm, corporation, or other legal entity, by lawful
action of the village, except as shall be expressly provided for in these
regulations and standards. (Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-7-7: AMENDMENT:
For the purpose of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare, the
regulations, standards, and restrictions set forth in this title may from time
to time be amended, supplemented, changed, or repealed by ordinance, as
provided by law. No such action may be taken unless and until a request is made
to the plan commission for a change by any person, by the plan commission, or
by the village board, and public hearing is held thereon in the same fashion as
is provided in title 10, chapter 13 of this code for amendments to the zoning
code, except that the provisions in title 10, chapter 13 of this code regarding
notice to property owners located within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the
subject property and regarding a written protest or petition against any
proposed amendments or changes shall not apply to amendments to this title.
(Ord. 2005-09, 12-19-2005)
11-7-8: MODIFICATION:
Where the plan commission finds that extraordinary hardships, other than purely
financial or practical difficulties, may result from strict compliance with
this title, it may recommend to the village board a modification of the
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured; provided, that such modification will not have the effect of
nullifying the purpose of the comprehensive plan or this title.
   (A)   Approval Of Modification: Neither the plan commission nor the village
board shall approve a modification to this title unless it finds in each
specific case, based upon the evidence presented by the petitioner, that all of
the following criteria have been met:
      1.   The granting of the modification will not be detrimental to the
public safety, health, or welfare, or injurious to other property;
      2.   The conditions upon which the modification request is based are
unique to the property for which the modification is sought and are not
applicable generally to other property;
      3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out; and
      4.   The modification will not in any manner vary the provisions of the
zoning code.
   (B)   Large Scale Development: The standards and requirements of this title
may be modified by the village board upon the recommendation of the plan
commission in case of a plan or a program for a planned development for a
community, or a neighborhood unit, which in the judgment of the plan commission
shall exceed the minimum requirements for adequate public space and
improvements for circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the
tract when fully developed and populated and which also provides such covenants
or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to the purposes of the
comprehensive plan.
   (C)   Procedure For Seeking Modifications: Applications for any such
modification, except those initiated by the plan commission, shall be submitted
in writing by the subdivider with the subdivision application at the time when
the preliminary plat is filed for the consideration of the plan commission. The
petitions shall state fully the grounds for the modification request and all
the facts relied upon by the petitioner to make the modification request.
   (D)   Review By The Plan Commission And Village Board: In recommending a
modification as provided in this section, the plan commission or village board
may prescribe such conditions, as will, in their judgment, secure substantially
the objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations and this
title in general. The recommendation of a modification by the plan commission
shall be conditional and subject to the final approval of the village board. In
reviewing a request for modification, the review and approval process shall be
the same as that provided in section
11-2-3 of this title at the same time the preliminary plat is reviewed by the
plan commission and the village board. However, the village board can take
action adverse to the plan commission by a majority vote rather than the two-
thirds (2/3) vote as set forth in subsection
11-2-3(J) of this title when the plan commission has voted to recommend
approval of a modification. If the plan commission votes to not recommend
approval of a modification, then the village board can only take adverse action
to the plan commission by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all board members. (Ord.
2005-09, 12-19-2005)

further report any continued violations of this title to the chairperson of the
village's ordinance committee.
   (B)   In case any structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
converted or any structure or land is used in violation of this title, the
proper authorities of the village, or any owner or tenant of real property in
the same contiguous district as the structure or land in question, in addition
to other remedies, may institute an appropriate action or proceeding in any
court of competent jurisdiction:
      1.   To prevent the unlawful construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair, conversion, maintenance, or use of a structure;

      3.   To prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about
such structure or land;
      4.   To restrain, correct or abate the violation.
   (C)   Any person, or any agent, employee, or contractor of such person, who
shall violate, disobey, omit, neglect, or refuse to comply with, or who shall
resist enforcement of any of the provisions of this title shall be subject to a
fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than seven hundred
fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense or to a penalty as provided for by
section
 1-4-13 of this code. The chairperson of the village's ordinance committee
shall be permitted to issue administrative citations for violations of this
title under section
1-4-13 of this code. Each day a violation is permitted to exist shall
constitute a separate offense.
   (D)   Nothing herein contained shall prevent the village from taking such
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation of this title.
   (E)   No subdivider, or owner or agent of the owner of any parcel of land
located in a proposed subdivision, shall transfer or sell such parcel before
final plat of the subdivision has been approved by the village board and
properly recorded with the Woodford County recorder of deeds. (Ord. 2005-09,

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
   BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
flood. The base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section
12-1-3 of this chapter.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
   BASEMENT: That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground

tanks. The term also includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers
installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days per year.
   CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare
of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required
include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations),
schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major roads
and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or electrical
transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals,
petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances).
   DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate including, but not
necessarily limited to:
   (A)   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building;
   (B)   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
   (C)   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days per year;
   (D)   Installation of utilities, construction of roads, bridges, culverts or
similar projects;
   (E)   Construction or erection of levees, dams, walls or fences;

subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed or buildings to be constructed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community.

five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SFHA: See definition of Floodplain And Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
   START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other
improvement, was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a

structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
   (B)   Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done. The term does
not include:

In addition, the village of Roanoke shall notify adjacent communities in
writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration
or relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 2010-04, 6-7-2010)
12-1-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the joint zoning and planning
board for a variance. The joint zoning and planning board shall review the
applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
Roanoke village board of trustees. The Roanoke village board of trustees may
attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to
further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   The joint zoning and planning board shall notify an applicant in
writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protections
standards of section
12-1-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
12-1-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
12-1-6 and
12-1-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 2010-04, 6-7-2010)
12-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the village of Roanoke or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 2010-04, 6-7-2010)
12-1-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the zoning officer may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
zoning officer shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The zoning officer shall make application to the circuit court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order
as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The zoning officer shall record a notice of violation on the title
of the property.
   (B)   The zoning officer shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The zoning officer is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of
the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate the
reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve
the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the joint zoning and planning board. Written notice of such
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the joint zoning and
planning board shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village of Roanoke from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 2010-04, 6-
7-2010)
12-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Roanoke
village board of trustees to fulfill the requirements of the national flood
insurance program including: ordinance 1987-04 regulating development in
special flood hazard areas. However, this chapter does not repeal the original
resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does
this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance, easements, covenants
or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2010-04, 6-7-2010)
12-1-15: SEVERABILITY:
The provisions and 3sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and the
invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the
remainder. (Ord. 2010-04, 6-7-2010)
