shall be appointed as a member of the Commission who is an immediate family
member of the Village President or Board of Trustees. Initially, two

      1.   To consider complaints of alleged violations of duties imposed in
Sections
1-23-3 and
1-23-4 of this Chapter.
      2.   To promulgate procedures and rules governing the performance of its
duties and the exercise of its powers.
      3.   The Commission is authorized to act upon the receipt of a written
complaint alleging a violation of this Chapter, within the Commission's
purview, by a Village covered individual or a contractor. Upon receipt of a
written complaint, the Commission may, based upon its assessment of the
validity of a written complaint, pursuant to the procedures below, investigate,

oath to questions, in both written and oral format.
It is the obligation of all Village covered individuals and contractors to
cooperate with the commission during the course of its investigations. Failure
or refusal to cooperate with requests by the Commission shall be a violation of
this Chapter.
      6.   The powers and duties of the Commission are limited to matters
clearly within the Commission's purview as set forth in this Chapter.
   C.   1.   Complaints alleging a violation of this Chapter within the purview
of the Commission shall be filed with the Commission upon receipt by the
Village, unless the complaint alleges facts which may, in the opinion of the
Village Attorney (or the Village Administrator if the Village Attorney is the
alleged offender), constitute a crime. If the complaint alleges facts which may
constitute a crime, it shall first be referred to a law enforcement agency or
the State's Attorney and may later be refiled with the Commission, at the
request of the complainant, if the agency or State's Attorney declines
prosecution or fails to act within thirty days.
      2.   a.   The Commission shall keep complaints confidential to the
fullest extent permitted by law until and unless the Commission determines that
the complaint is supported by sufficient evidence and the Commission determines
there are reasonable grounds that the complaint establishes a violation of this
Chapter within the Commission's purview. Prior to a determination by the
Commission that a complaint is supported by sufficient evidence and there are
reasonable grounds that the complaint establishes a violation of this Chapter
within the Commission's purview, consideration of complaints by the Commission
at a meeting shall be closed to the public to the extent authorized by the Open
Meetings Act.
         b.   A copy of the complaint shall be provided to the Village
Attorney, Village Administrator, Village President and Village Board of
Trustees immediately upon its receipt by the Commission. The Village
Administrator shall assign Village staff to support the Commission in the
discharge of its duties under this Section.
         c.   Within a reasonable time after the receipt of a complaint, the
Commission shall meet and conduct an initial review of the sufficiency of the
complaint. The Commission may dismiss a complaint if any of the following
criteria are met:
            (1)   The complaint, on its face or as clarified, fails to state a
violation of one of the laws or regulations within the Commission's purview.
            (2)   The complaint, on its face or as clarified, lacks sufficient
factual detail, or is so speculative, conclusory or incoherent that the
Commission cannot infer that a violation may have occurred or may be occurring.
            (3)   Based on all of the facts and information provided by the
complainant, or publicly available information, the Commission cannot
reasonably conclude that a violation has occurred.
            (4)   The Commission obtained credible information indicating that
the allegations raised by the complainant are currently resolved.
            (5)   The Commission determines that the complaint is moot or
unripe.
            (6)   The Commission is currently investigating the same conduct in
another complaint.
            (7)   Another reason provided by the Commission.
If the Commission dismisses a complaint it shall include the reasoning for the
dismissal in the meeting minutes and in a written determination.
Notwithstanding any term in this Chapter to the contrary, the Commission may
dismiss a complaint at any stage.
         d.   If the Commission determines that a complaint passes an initial
review, the Commission shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested,
a notice to the respondent that a complaint has been filed against them and a
copy of the complaint. The Commission shall send by certified mail, return
receipt requested, a confirmation of the receipt of the complaint to an
identified complainant, within five business days after the Commission's
determination that the complaint passed the initial review. The notices to the
respondent and an identified complainant shall also advise them of the date,
time, and place of a Commission meeting to determine the sufficiency of the
complaint and to establish whether reasonable grounds exist to proceed.
      3.   Within a reasonable time after sending notice of the complaint to
respondent and an identified complainant, and upon not less than forty-eight
hours' public notice, the Commission shall meet to further review the
sufficiency of the complaint and, if the complaint is supported by sufficient
evidence and is deemed sufficient to allege a violation of this Chapter within
the Commission's purview, to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to
proceed, based on the evidence presented, to proceed. The Commission shall
issue notice to an identified complainant and the respondent of the
Commission's ruling on the evidentiary sufficiency of the complaint and, if
necessary, on whether there are reasonable grounds to proceed within fifteen
business days after receiving the complaint.
In determining whether the complaint is support by sufficient evidence and
establishes reasonable grounds for a violation of this Chapter within the
purview of the Commission, the Commission may dismiss a complaint for any of
the reasons in Section 1-23-8.C.2.c. above.
      4.   If the complaint is deemed to be supported by sufficient evidence to
allege a violation of this Chapter within the Commission's purview and there is
a determination of reasonable grounds to proceed, then the Commission shall
issue notice to the respondent and an identified complainant including a
hearing date scheduled within four weeks after the complaint's receipt.
Alternatively, the Commission may elect to notify in writing the attorney
designated by the Corporate Authorities to prosecute such actions and request
that the complaint be adjudicated judicially. If the complaint is deemed not
sufficient to allege a violation or if there is no determination of reasonable
grounds to proceed, then the Commission shall send by certified mail, return
receipt requested, a notice to the respondent and an identified complainant, of
the decision to dismiss the complaint, and that notice shall be made public.
      5.   If the complaint is deemed sufficient to allege a violation of this
Chapter within the Commission's purview and the Commission finds that
reasonable grounds to proceed are established, then the Commission shall notify
in writing the
attorney designated by the Corporate Authorities to prosecute such actions and
shall transmit to the attorney the complaint and all additional documents in
the custody of the commission concerning the alleged violation.
      6.   On the scheduled date and upon at least forty-eight hours' public
notice of the meeting, the Commission shall conduct a hearing on the complaint
and shall allow the respondent and an identified complainant the opportunity to
present testimony and evidence. The hearing may be closed to the public if
authorized by the Open Meetings Act.
      7.   Within thirty days after the date the hearing or any recessed
hearing is concluded, the Commission shall either: a) dismiss the complaint for
any of the reasons in Section 1-23-8.C.2.c. above or b) issue a recommendation
for discipline to the alleged violator and to the Village Administrator, or if
the Village Administrator is the alleged violator, to the Village President, or
impose a fine upon the violator, or both. The findings in the case, any
recommendation for discipline, and any fine imposed shall not be confidential
and shall be a matter of public information.
      8.   If the hearing was closed to the public, the respondent may file a
written demand for a public hearing on the complaint within seven business days
after the issuance of the recommendation for discipline or imposition of a
fine, or both. The filing of the demand shall stay the enforcement of the
recommendation or fine. Within fourteen days after receiving the demand, the
Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the complaint upon at least forty-
eight hours' public notice of the hearing and allow the respondent and an
identified complainant the opportunity to present testimony and evidence.
Within seven days thereafter, the Commission shall publicly issue a final
recommendation to the alleged violator and to the Village President or Village
Administrator, or impose a fine upon the violator, or both.
      9.   If a complaint is filed during the sixty days preceding the date of
any election at which the respondent is a candidate, the Commission shall
render its decision within seven days after the complaint is filed, and during
the seven days preceding that election, the Commission shall render such
decision before the date of that election, if possible.
      10.   The Commission may fine any person who knowingly violates any
provision of this Chapter within the Commission's purview or who knowingly
files a frivolous complaint alleging a violation of this Chapter within the
Commission's purview. The Commission may recommend to the Village President and
Board of Trustees any appropriate discipline up to and including discharge or
removal of office for any Village covered individual found in violation of this
chapter or person filing a frivolous complaint. The recommendation of the
Commission shall be deemed sufficient cause for discipline, discharge or
removal from office without further proceedings by the Village, unless the
offender is subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Fire and Police
Commissioners or as otherwise required by a collective bargaining agreement or
employment contract.
      11.   A complaint alleging a violation of this Chapter within the
Commission's purview must be filed within twelve months after the complainant
knew or reasonably could have known of the alleged violation. (Ord. 3861, 4-25-
2022)
1-23-9: PENALTIES:
   A.   A person who knowingly violates any provision of this chapter or who
knowingly files a frivolous complaint alleging a violation of this chapter is
subject to a fine in an amount of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not
more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750).
   B.   Subject to limitations in collective bargaining agreements and
contracts to which the Village is a party, in addition to a fine, any Village
covered individual who knowingly violates any provision of this chapter or who
knowingly files a frivolous complaint alleging a violation of this chapter is
subject to discipline, discharge, or removal from office, as the case may be.

addition to a fine, any contractor which knowingly violates any provision of
this chapter or who knowingly files a frivolous complaint alleging a violation
of this chapter, the Village Board may determine that such contractor is no
longer eligible to do business with the Village and bar said contractor from
doing business with the Village. (Ord. 3861, 4-25-2022)

The purpose of this chapter is to provide a fair and efficient method of
determining the eligibility of a Village employee for the benefits enumerated
under the Public Safety Employee Benefits Act, 820 Illinois Compiled Statutes
320/1, et seq., as amended ("PSEBA"). All benefits provided by the Village to
employees pursuant to the PSEBA shall be consistent with the PSEBA. (Ord. 3658,
8-21-2017)
1-24-2: POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR ADMINISTERING APPLICATIONS FOR PSEBA BENEFITS:
   A.   Employees, or family member(s) of injured or deceased employees, who
may qualify for PSEBA benefits must file a full and complete application in
writing with the Village Administrator.
   B.   A complete application shall include the following:
      1.   The applicant's name and date of hire, detailed information
regarding the incident for which PSEBA benefits are sought, including
information relating to how the injury was sustained in the line of duty,
including the date, time, place, nature of injury, and other factual

         d.   The investigation of a criminal act.
      3.   A signed unconditional PSEBA medical authorization release which
authorizes the Village to collect information related to the incident
including, but not limited to, disability pension proceedings, worker's
compensation records, and medical records, and a complete list of the names and
addresses for all health care providers involved in the diagnosis, treatment,
review or handling of the injury for which PSEBA benefits are sought.
      4.   A signed unconditional PSEBA general information release specifying
the name and signature of the applicant or her/his authorized representative
along with legal proof of said representation and name and signature of witness
authorizing the collection of information necessary to review the application.

applicant intends to call at the PSEBA hearing, along with their anticipated
subjects of testimony and any opinions the witnesses are expected to give.

to certify the truthfulness of the application's contents.
   D.   On the date that the PSEBA application is deemed complete by the
Village, the completed application shall then be submitted to the Village
Administrator as the preliminary record, and a copy of the same shall be date
stamped and provided to the applicant.
   E.   Upon receipt of a complete application for PSEBA benefits, the Village
Administrator shall set the matter for an administrative hearing before a
Hearing Officer to make a determination on whether to grant the application and
provide the applicant with benefits under the PSEBA.
   F.   The applicant shall be given written notice of the date for the
administrative hearing not less than ten calendar days prior to the
commencement of the hearing. If the applicant, upon receiving written notice of
the administrative hearing, cannot attend said date, the applicant must contact
the Hearing Officer in writing within seven calendar days after being served.
The Hearing Officer shall establish an alternative hearing date within thirty
calendar days of the original hearing date. The applicant's failure to appear
at the administrative hearing shall result in denial of PSEBA benefits.
   G.   The Village Administrator may delegate any of his/her authority, duties
and obligations under this chapter, in whole or part, to a designee, or
designees. (Ord. 3658, 8-21-2017)
1-24-3: POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR HEARINGS FOR PSEBA BENEFITS:
   A.   Hearing Officer: The Village Administrator shall be the Hearing Officer
for hearings on applications for PSEBA benefits. The Hearing Officer shall have
all of the authorities granted under statute and common law relative to the
conduct of administrative hearings, including to:
      1.   Adopt, revise and enforce rules of procedure for hearings;
      2.   Preside over hearings;
      3.   Administer oaths;
      4.   Hear testimony and accept evidence that is relevant to the issue of
eligibility under PSEBA;
      5.   Issue subpoenas to secure attendance of witnesses and the production
of relevant papers or documents upon the request of the applicant, the Village,
the Hearing Officer;
      6.   Rule upon objections to the admissibility of evidence;
      7.   Preserve and authenticate the record of the hearing and all exhibits
in evidence introduced at the hearing; and
      8.   Issue a final determination on applications for PSEBA benefits based
on the evidence presented at the hearing, the determination of which shall be
in writing and shall include a written finding of fact, decision and order.
   B.   Hearings: Hearings for the determination of eligibility for benefits
under PSEBA shall be initiated by the Village after the submission of a full
and complete PSEBA application, and a determination by the Hearing Officer that
it is appropriate to proceed with the hearing, which determination shall
include consideration of the status of any disability pension proceeding
related to the applicant and whether the disability pension proceeding has
resulted in a final and non-appealable decision. A hearing shall be held to
adjudicate and determine whether the applicant is eligible for benefits under
the PSEBA. If the applicant is found eligible, the PSEBA benefits provided to
the applicant shall be consistent with the PSEBA.
      1.   Record: Hearings shall be attended by a certified court reporter,
and a transcript of all proceedings shall be made by said certified court
reporter.
      2.   Procedures: The Village and the applicant shall be entitled to
representation by counsel at hearings and may present witnesses, testimony and
documents, may cross-examine opposing witnesses, and may request the issuance
by the Hearing Officer of subpoenas to compel the appearance of relevant
witnesses or the production of relevant documents. The Hearing Officer may
issue subpoenas to compel the appearance of relevant witnesses or the
production of relevant documents in his/her discretion.
      3.   Evidence: The Illinois Rules of Evidence shall apply to the extent
practicable unless, by such application, the Hearing Officer determines that
application of the rule would be an injustice or preclude the introduction of
evidence of the type commonly relied upon by a reasonably prudent person in the
conduct of her/his affairs. Such determination shall be in the sole discretion
of the Hearing Officer.
      4.   Final Determination: A written determination by the Hearing Officer
of whether the applicant is eligible for benefits under the PSEBA shall
constitute a final administrative determination for the purpose of judicial
review under the common law writ of certiorari. Motions to reconsider, set
aside or challenge the final determination of the Hearing Officer are not
permitted.
      5.   Burden Of Proof: At any administrative hearing, the applicant shall
have the obligation and burden of proof to establish that the applicant is
eligible and qualified to receive PSEBA benefits. The standard of proof in all
hearings shall be by the preponderance of the evidence. (Ord. 3658, 8-21-2017)
1-24-4: PSEBA BENEFITS GRANTED BY THE VILLAGE:
   A.   Basic Group Insurance Plan: If an applicant is determined to be
eligible for PSEBA benefits, the applicant will be eligible to receive
continued health coverage consistent with the PSEBA under the Village's basic
group health insurance plan. The basic group health insurance plan shall be the
least expensive health plan offered to Village employees. The basic group
health insurance plan may change from time to time in the Village's sole
discretion. PSEBA beneficiaries may only change from one health insurance plan
to another during the Village's open enrollment period. PSEBA beneficiaries may
choose to enroll in any other health insurance plan offered by the Village
different from the basic group health insurance plan, but any PSEBA beneficiary
who does so shall pay the difference in insurance premiums between the
Village's basic plan and the other plan. Failure of a PSEBA beneficiary to
timely pay the difference in insurance premiums shall result in coverage in the
basic health insurance plan. PSEBA benefits do not include benefits not
provided in the Village's basic group health insurance plan, such as, but not
limited to, dental, vision, life insurance, etc.
   B.   Reduction Or Elimination Of PSEBA Benefits By Other Health Coverage: If
an applicant or PSEBA beneficiary becomes eligible to receive health insurance
benefits from any other source, including, but not limited to, Medicare, the
PSEBA beneficiary's PSEBA coverage may be reduced or eliminated as determined
by the Village consistent with PSEBA. If there is another source, the applicant
or PSEBA beneficiary shall notify the Village of that source no later than five
business days from that source becoming available to the applicant, the
applicant's beneficiaries or the PSEBA beneficiary. Applicants and PSEBA
beneficiaries have an ongoing obligation to, and shall, update the Village with
their health insurance coverage information available from any other source,
and failure to do so may result in the denial of benefits and/or reimbursement
to the Village for duplicate coverage. If duplicate coverage has been received
by a PSEBA beneficiary, further PSEBA benefits will be denied until the Village
has been fully reimbursed by the PSEBA beneficiary for what it would have been
credited if it had known about other coverage. Receipt of health insurance
benefits from other sources without notice to the Village shall require the
PSEBA beneficiary to reimburse the Village for the value of those benefits.
   C.   Affidavit Of Continued PSEBA Eligibility: All recipients of PSEBA
benefits from the Village shall complete and return to the Village
Administrator on an annual basis an affidavit verifying the recipient's
continued eligibility for PSEBA benefits. The affidavit must be completed and
returned to the Village Administrator within sixty calendar days of written
notice from the Village. If the recipient does not complete and return the
affidavit within the time required, the Village Administrator shall give the
recipient an additional written notice providing an additional thirty calendar
days for the recipient to complete and return the affidavit. Failure to return
the affidavit within the time required shall result in the recipient incurring
responsibility for reimbursing the Village for premiums paid during the period
the affidavit is due and not filed. (Ord. 3732, 3-11-2019)
CHAPTER 25
ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
SECTION:
1-25-1: Purpose
1-25-2: Prohibited Conduct
1-25-3: Sexual Harassment
1-25-4: Employee Responsibility
1-25-5: Reporting Complaints Of Harassment
1-25-6: Village Response
1-25-7: Federal And State Remedies
1-25-8: Policy Against Retaliation
1-25-9: Confidentiality
1-25-1: PURPOSE:
The Village is committed to maintaining an environment free from discrimination
and harassment. In keeping with this commitment, the Village will not tolerate
any form of harassment that violates this policy. This policy forbids
harassment by any employee, supervisor, elected official, vendor, client,
customer or other person, against any employee or third party. (Ord. 3671, 12-
11-2017)
1-25-2: PROHIBITED CONDUCT:
   A.   Harassment consists of discriminatory employment action and any
unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is based upon a
person's protected status, including race, age, genetic information, sex,
sexual orientation, color, religious affiliation, political preference,
national origin, disability, ancestry, marital status, status as a civil
partner, unfavorable discharge from the military (except dishonorable), or
other protected status under applicable law. The Village will not tolerate
harassing conduct that results in tangible employment action that interferes
unreasonably with an individual's work performance, or that creates an
intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
   B.   The conduct forbidden by this policy specifically includes, but is not
limited to:
      1.   Bullying, causing mental distress, epithets, slurs, negative
stereotyping, threatening or intimidating acts that are based on a person's
protected status; and
      2.   Written or graphic material circulated, available on the Village's
computer system, or posted or distributed within the workplace that is obscene,
hostile or derogatory toward a person or persons because of their protected
status.
   C.   Even where the conduct is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to
constitute actionable harassment, the Village discourages any such conduct in
the workplace and such conduct may serve as the basis for disciplinary action
under the Village's policies. (Ord. 3671, 12-11-2017)
1-25-3: SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   This policy forbids harassment based on gender regardless of whether
the offensive conduct is sexual in nature and regardless of whether the
individual being harassed is of the same or different gender.
   B.   Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal
or physical conduct based on sex constitute sexual harassment when: 1)
submission to the conduct is an explicit or implicit term of employment, 2)
submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for an employment
decision affecting an individual (tangible employment action), or 3) such
conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an
individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive
working environment.
   C.   This policy forbids any unwelcome or harassing conduct based on gender
regardless of whether it rises to the level of a legal violation.
   D.   The Village considers the following conduct to represent, but are not
limited to, some of the types of acts that violate this policy:
      1.   Physical assaults of a sexual nature including but not limited to
rape, sexual battery or molestation, intentional physical conduct which is
sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, etc.
      2.   Unwanted sexual advances, propositions or other sexual comments
including, but not limited to sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks, and
jokes, sexual innuendo or suggestive comments, or verbal abuse of a sexual
nature. Also included are preferential treatment and promises of a preferential
treatment to an employee for submitting to sexual conduct.
      3.   Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications anywhere in the
Village's workplace by Village employees including but not limited to pictures,
posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, reading materials, or other materials
that are sexually suggestive, demeaning or pornographic. (Ord. 3671, 12-11-
2017)
1-25-4: EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITY:
Everyone at the Village can help assure that the workplace is free from
prohibited discrimination or harassment. Every employee is expected to refrain
from any behavior or conduct that could reasonably be interpreted as prohibited
harassment. (Ord. 3671, 12-11-2017)
1-25-5: REPORTING COMPLAINTS OF HARASSMENT:
In the event an employee believes he or she has been confronted by or has
witnessed an act of harassment, it is the employee's responsibility to
immediately report such action to the employee's Supervisor, Department Head,
Assistant Village Administrator, Village Administrator or Village Attorney.
These are the individuals who are authorized by this policy to receive and act
upon complaints of harassment or discrimination on behalf of the Village. This
policy does not require reporting harassment or discrimination to any
individual who is the source of the harassing or discriminatory conduct.
It is critical in establishing a workplace free of harassment that an
individual who experiences or witnesses an incident perceived as being
harassing has access to a mechanism for reporting such incidents. At the same
time, the purposes of this policy against harassment in the workplace are not
furthered where a complaint is found to be false and frivolous and made to
accomplish some other end than stopping harassment. A complaint that is
determined to be false and frivolous can result in a severe level of discipline
or discharge. A false or frivolous complaint does not refer to complaints made
in good faith that cannot be proven. (Ord. 3671, 12-11-2017)
1-25-6: VILLAGE RESPONSE:
Once the Supervisor, Department Head, Assistant Village Administrator, or
Village Attorney receives a complaint, it shall be their responsibility to
notify the Village Administrator on the date of the alleged occurrence if
reasonably possible, or on the next business day. All complaints will be taken
seriously and given a high priority. The Village Administrator will direct that
an investigation be conducted and the nature of such investigation will depend
on the circumstances of the complaint. The Village may put reasonable interim
measures in place, such as a leave of absence or a transfer, to diminish the
potential for further harassment while the investigation takes place. The
Village will take further appropriate action once the complaints have been
thoroughly investigated. That action may be a conclusion that a violation
occurred, as explained immediately below. The Village might also conclude,
depending on the circumstances, either that no violation of policy occurred or
that the Village cannot conclude whether or not a violation occurred.
If an investigation reveals that a violation of this policy or other
inappropriate conduct has occurred then the Village will take corrective
action, including discipline up to and including dismissal, as is appropriate
under the circumstances, regardless of the job positions of the parties
involved. The Village may discipline an employee for any inappropriate conduct
discovered in investigating reports made under this policy, regardless of
whether the conduct amounts to a violation of law. If the person who engaged in
harassment is not employed by the Village, then the Village will take whatever
corrective action is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. (Ord.
3671, 12-11-2017)
1-25-7: FEDERAL AND STATE REMEDIES:
   A.   The Village prefers to resolve any complaints regarding unlawful
harassment or discrimination in violation of this policy internally, but also
recognizes the employee's right to file administrative claims with the
following Federal and State agencies:
1. United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
  500 W. Madison Street, Suite 2800
  Chicago, IL 60661
  Chicago: 800-669-4000
  Chicago TTY: 800-869-8001
  Charges must be filed within 300 days of the incident.
   
2. State of Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR)
  100 W. Randolph Street, 10th Floor
  Chicago, IL 60601
  Chicago: 312-814-6200 or 800-662-3942
  Chicago TTY: 866-740-3953
  Charges must be filed within 180 days of the incident.
 
(Ord. 3671, 12-11-2017)
1-25-8: POLICY AGAINST RETALIATION:
The Village forbids retaliation toward or against any individual who makes a
good-faith complaint of harassment; assists or cooperates in an investigation
of a complaint by someone else, whether internally or with an external agency;
or files a charge of discrimination or harassment; or otherwise provides
information in a proceeding, including in a court, administrative or
legislative hearing, related to violations of discrimination or harassment
laws. Examples of the types of retaliation that are prohibited include
intimidation; discrimination; verbal or physical abuse; adverse actions with
respect to pay, work assignments, and other terms of employment; termination of
employment; or threats of any such action. Retaliation is a serious violation
of this policy that may result in discipline up to and including dismissal. All
employees who experience or witness any conduct they believe to be retaliatory

hereafter adopted by the President and Board from time to time.
   C.   Bond: Before any license to conduct and operate a taxicab business

with the Village Administrator satisfactory evidence that a bond or insurance
policy covering property damage in the amount of one thousand five hundred
dollars has been issued and is in force covering each vehicle used or operated

   D.   Issuance Of License: The Village Administrator is hereby authorized and
empowered to issue licenses to operate and conduct a taxicab business in the
Village in the manner herein provided, upon compliance with the requirements of
this Chapter. No taxicab business shall be conducted by any person with less
than a minimum of five taxicabs. The fee for such license shall be as set forth
in Section

   E.   Register: It shall be the duty of the Village Clerk to keep a register
of the names of persons to whom such licenses are granted, the date or dates
when issued, the number of license or licenses and the description of the
taxicab or taxicabs so licensed.
   F.   Inspection: No taxicab shall be licensed until it has been inspected
under the direction of the Chief of Police and found to be in safe condition
for the transportation of passengers, clean, of good appearance and well
painted, and a certificate of inspection for its taximeter issued as herein
provided. Provided, further, that each such taxicab shall carry outside on both
the left and right side in lettering not less than two inches in height the
name of the person owning or operating such taxicab and the number of such
taxicab. No taxicab shall be equipped with or display any lights other than
white or amber on the front and other than red on the rear of such taxicab.
Such license for a particular taxicab shall be transferable to a different
taxicab only by authority of the Chief of Police.
No taxicab so licensed shall be operated or driven in the Village unless it is
inspected and approved at least once in every six months under the direction of
the Chief of Police. Such inspection shall be made at such time and place, and
in such manner, as determined by the Chief of Police.
   G.   Certificate Of Registration: Upon the proper payment of the required
license fee, a decalcomania transfer certificate of registration shall be
issued by the Village Clerk. Such certificate shall be affixed to the
windshield of the taxicab in the lower right-hand corner.
   H.   Transfer: It shall be unlawful to transfer any license to operate and
conduct a taxicab business from one person to another person.
   I.   Suspension: If any licensed taxicab shall become unsafe for the
transportation of passengers or shall become unclean or unsightly in
appearance, as determined by the Chief of Police, such license for such
particular taxicab shall be suspended by the Chief of Police until the said
taxicab and all its appurtenances shall, in the opinion of the Chief of Police
be put in fit condition for public use. Failure to keep such taxicabs in a safe
and clean condition may also be grounds for suspension or revocation of the
business license. Any such suspension or revocation shall be governed by the
procedures set forth in Sections
 3-1-11 and
3-1-12 of this Title. (Ord. 2668, 2-12-1996)
3-4-6: TAXIMETERS:
   A.   Taximeters Required: Each taxicab shall be provided with a taximeter or
instrument so devised as to register, in plain view of the passenger, the fares
as accumulated while said cab is in operation.
   B.   Operation: Taximeters shall be connected with and operated from the
front wheel or the transmission of the taxicab to which they are attached. No
taxicab shall operate while engaged, unless such taximeter shall be accurately
recording the fare to be charged, except where the taxicab is hired on an
hourly or flat-rate basis.
Each taximeter shall be equipped with a flag at least three inches by two
inches in size, either painted red or bearing thereon in letters at least one
inch in height the word "vacant" or the words "for hire". The flag post of such
flag shall be up or towards a vertical position when the taxicab is for hire,
and said flag shall be immediately pulled down and kept in a horizontal
position when such taxicab is engaged. The taximeter shall register either the
minimum or flat-rate fare at the beginning of each trip.
   C.   Additional Passengers; Rates Of Fares: Each taximeter shall be provided
with a suitable mechanism to register the fare for all additional passengers
and also be equipped with a suitable registering device to be specified and
approved by the Chief of Police for the purpose of indicating and registering
all flat-rate fares, which device may be a part of the taximeter.
The taximeter shall have a dial which shall register the tariff in accordance
with the legal rates of fare. Each taxicab shall be equipped with a light
which, during the period between sunset and sunrise, shall be so reflected upon
the dial of the taximeter as to enable the passenger to read the figures
registered thereon.
   D.   Inspection: At least once every six months the Chief of Police or his
agent shall inspect, test and seal all taximeters in use in the Village. In
addition thereto, whenever complaint is made to the Chief of Police that any
taximeter registers inaccurately, it shall be his duty to cause immediately an
inspection and test of such taximeter. If said taximeter does not properly and
accurately register, it shall be unlawful to operate the taxicab until it is
equipped with a taximeter approved by the Chief of Police or his agent. The
owner or operator of any taxicab shall, upon demand, deliver to the Chief of
Police or his agent the taxicab, together with the taximeter, or the taximeter
detached therefrom, for inspection and test. Said owner or operator may be
present or represented at the time such inspection and test are made.
Every taximeter shall be tested to determine the accuracy of its recording
mechanism with respect to distance traveled, either by running the taxicab to
which it is attached over a course, a standard mile in length, or by a
mechanical test. Both or either of the foregoing tests may be made at the
discretion of the Chief of Police or his agent. To determine whether a
taximeter correctly registers waiting time, such taximeter shall be tested by
comparing the time recorded as shown by the fare computed on the dial with the
standard time. When a test shows that a taximeter correctly records the charge
of fare measured by distance traveled, waiting time and extra passengers, it
shall be sealed and a certificate of the test shall be issued to the owner or
operator by the Chief of Police.
It shall be the duty of the Chief of Police or his agent to seal all taximeters
found accurate and correct, and to keep a record of the numbers of each
taximeter and the date of the inspection thereof in the books of his office and
to furnish a copy of such inspections to the President. The fee to be charged
for the regular inspection every six months of each taximeter is hereby fixed
at the sum of two dollars fifty cents with no charge for additional inspections
unless the taximeter registers inaccurately, in which case the inspection fee
for each additional inspection shall likewise be two dollars fifty cents.
   E.   Listing Of Fares: There shall be affixed on the inside of each taxicab
in a conspicuous place and in such manner that the same may be easily and
conveniently read by any person riding in such taxicab, a card in a frame
covered by glass, upon which card shall be printed in plain and legible type
the rates of fare as prescribed by this Code.
   F.   Collection Of Fares: It shall be the duty of the driver of each taxicab
at the termination of each trip to throw the flag to the non-recording position
on the taximeter and call the passenger's attention to the fare registered. The
taximeter shall not be changed until the fare has been paid or a charge ticket
made out and handed the person hiring such taxicab. Any passenger shall be
entitled to receive, upon request, a receipt for the fare paid.
   G.   Transfer: No person owning, controlling or driving any taxicab shall
transfer the taximeter to any other taxicab without having had, prior thereto,
a new inspection and certification of such taximeter. No person shall tamper
with, break or mutilate any taximeter, cable or seal thereof. (Ord. 2668, 2-12-
1996)
3-4-7: TAXICAB DRIVERS:
   A.   License Required: It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a
taxicab, which is licensed under this Code, without first having obtained a
taxicab driver's license from the Village. No person owning, controlling or
operating any such taxicab shall employ or permit any person other than a
driver legally licensed by the State and as a taxicab driver licensed by the
Village to operate such taxicab upon the streets of the Village.
   B.   Application For License: Any person desiring to secure a license as a
driver of any taxicab licensed hereunder and used for the carriage of
passengers for hire shall make application in writing therefor to the Chief of
Police upon a form provided for such purpose. Such application shall set forth
the name of the applicant and his residence and occupation. Every applicant
shall hold a valid State driver's license. The Chief of Police shall make a
detailed and diligent inquiry as to the character and record of the applicant,

shall be kept the name and residence address of each licensed driver, together
with the names of the persons endorsing his application, and shall carefully
note opposite each such driver's name such information as he may gain
concerning him and as may be necessary to provide a complete record of his
conduct and qualifications as a driver.
   E.   Transfer Of Driver's License: It shall be unlawful to transfer any
driver's license or badge from one person to another. (Ord. 2668, 2-12-1996)
3-4-8: RATES:
The Board may, from time to time, establish by ordinance just and reasonable
rates and charges, which shall be uniform as to all taxicabs operated within
the village. No licensee, whether owner, operator or driver, shall charge,
collect or receive greater or less or different rates of compensation for the
use of taxicabs than those established herein or fixed hereafter from time to
time by ordinance. Every person shall be entitled to the services of taxicabs
at the established rates and charges. The following schedule of rates and
charges is hereby declared to be just and reasonable, computable according to
the distance traveled and the time consumed as indicated by the taximeter

Every taxicab shall be operated regularly to the extent reasonably necessary to
meet the public demand for taxicab service. In the event that the service of

No person shall engage in or conduct the business of a peddler in this Village
without first having obtained a special peddler's license to do so as
hereinafter provided. There shall be no fee charged for issuance of such

3-5-3: APPLICATION FOR LICENSE; BOND REQUIRED:
Every person who desires a license as a peddler shall make application in
writing to the Village Police Chief stating:

has been held by the Village for more than sixty days and the person whose
property is being held has not obtained a license as required under this
Chapter, the Village may petition the Circuit Court for an order for the sale
of the property being held. If the Court finds that the person whose property
is being held has not obtained a license as required by this Chapter, the Court
may order the Village to sell the property. Proceeds of the sale of the
property, less reimbursement for the expenses of storage and sale of the
property, shall be deposited in the Treasury of the Village.
It shall be prima facie evidence that a person is a transient merchant or
itinerant vendor under this Chapter, if the person does not transact business
from a fixed location or if the person does not own, or does not lease for a
period of at least six months, the property from which the business is
conducted. (Ord. 2668, 2-12-1996)

taxpayer who made the erroneous payment; provided that no amounts erroneously
paid more than three years prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so

for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than ninety days after the expiration of the forty five day
period.
   J.   Interest And Penalties:
      1.   Interest: The village hereby provides for the amount of interest to
be assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be
eighteen percent per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five days
and the number of days elapsed.
      2.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed
within the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late
filing penalty of five percent of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent of the
tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner
provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village issuing a
notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file
penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent of the total tax due for
the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be filed.
A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to file penalty
is imposed by the controlling ordinance.
   K.   Abatement: The local tax administrator shall have the authority to
waive or abate any late filing penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing.

contract with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes, penalty and/or interest
due under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax administrator may not
cancel any installment contract so entered unless the taxpayer fails to pay any
amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the local tax administrator that
the payment is thirty days delinquent, the taxpayer shall have fourteen days to
cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the
fourteen day period or fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the
installment contract with the local administrator, the installment contract
shall be canceled without further notice to the taxpayer.
   M.   Statute Of Limitations: Unless otherwise provided in this code or any
agreement with the village, a taxpayer or other person or entity claiming or
owing taxes shall have thirty days after receiving a notice or statement to
make any request for refund or provide any tax due and owing.
      1.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
      2.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the village,
the tax paid was less than seventy five percent of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years after the end of the calendar year in which
return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which
the return for the applicable period was filed.
      3.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer.
   N.   Voluntary Disclosure: For any locally imposed and administered tax for
which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation,
or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file
an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of
the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to
pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent per month, for
all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years
before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary
disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or
penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if
the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the
taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the
underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of
the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void.
The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety days after
the filing of the voluntary disclosure application of the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within ninety days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.
   O.   Publication Of Tax Ordinances: Any locally administered tax ordinance
shall be published via normal or standard publishing requirements. The posting
of a tax ordinance on the internet shall satisfy the publication requirement.
Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request
at the village clerk's office.
   P.   Review Of Lien: The local tax administrator shall establish an internal
review procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid
taxes. Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is
valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is
determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall:
      1.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
      2.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
      3.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
   Q.   Application: This section shall be liberally construed and administered

4-1-1: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
The Village wishes to provide modern, safe and generally accepted building
codes. As such, the building codes as adopted herein provide for use of
nationally accepted codes with minimal modifications. These building codes
include performance based regulations which make possible the acceptance of new
materials and methods of construction that may not be specifically recognized
in the most recently adopted editions of these national codes, provided such
materials and methods satisfy nationally recognized standards as the criteria
for evaluation of minimum safe practice and further provided that such use of
alternative materials or practices are recognized and approved by a licensed
professional architect, engineer or structural engineer in the state.
The village recognizes that alterations and repairs to existing structures
represent the overwhelming majority of building activity within the village and
that such activity may occur without requiring the existing structure to comply
with all the requirements of the code, providing the existing structure is
maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. (Ord. 2503, 6-22-1992; amd. Ord.

4-5-1: PURPOSE:
The regulation of signs by this code is intended to promote and protect the
public health, safety and welfare by reducing the depreciation of property
values caused by signs that are incompatible with surrounding land uses; by
creating a more attractive economic and business climate within the commercial
and office areas of the village; by enhancing and protecting the physical and
aesthetic appearance of all areas of the village; and by reducing the
distractions, obstructions and hazards to pedestrian and auto traffic caused by
the indiscriminate placement and use of signs. (Ord. 3392, 9-12-2011; amd. Ord.
3825, 11-30-2020)
4-5-2: SCOPE:
Any sign not expressly permitted by these regulations shall be prohibited. The
regulations of this chapter shall govern and control the erection, enlargement,
expansion, alteration, operation, maintenance, relocation and removal of all
signs within the village visible from any right-of-way, sidewalk or public or
private common open space. The regulations of this chapter relate to the
location of signs, by function and type, within zoning districts and are in
addition to provisions of this code applicable to the construction and
maintenance of signs. Regulations concerning the use and termination of
nonconforming signs are in section
4-5-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 3392, 9-12-2011; amd. Ord. 3825, 11-30-2020)

relocated or maintained unless a sign permit evidencing the compliance of such
work with the provisions of this chapter and other applicable provisions of
this code shall have first been issued by the village in accordance with the
provisions of this section; provided, however, that routine sign maintenance
(totaling less than $500.00 annually) or changing of parts designed to be
changed shall not, standing alone, be considered an alteration of the sign
requiring the issuance of a sign permit by the village.
   B.   Additional Application Requirements: Every application for a sign
permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Plans and specifications showing the location on the lot or building
face and the method of construction, illumination and support of such sign;
      2.   A scale drawing showing sign faces, exposed surfaces and the
proposed design, accurately represented as to size, area, proportion and color;
      3.   Photographs of the right-of-way sides of the property in question,
showing all existing signs on the property;
      4.   A calculation of the total amount of sign area presently existing on
the property;

or used for the purpose of communicating a message or identifying a product,
service, person, organization, business or event, with the use of words or
characters, visible from outside the premises on which such device is located.
   B.   Illumination:
      1.   Location and Design of Light Source: Whenever an external artificial
light source is used for a sign, such source shall be located, shielded and
directed so as not to be directly visible from any right-of-way or private
residence. No receptacle or device housing a permitted light source for a sign
shall protrude more than twelve inches from the face of the sign or building to
which it is attached; provided, however, that a receptacle or device housing a
permitted light source for a sign may be located more than twelve inches from
the face of the sign if such light source is ground mounted, locked in place
and cannot be redirected.
      2.   Level of Illumination: In no event shall the illumination of any
sign, resulting from any internal or external artificial light source, exceed
one hundred twenty foot- candles when measured with a standard light meter held
perpendicular to the sign face at a distance equal to the narrowest dimension
of such sign face. All artificial illumination shall be so designed, located,
shielded and directed as to prevent the casting of glare or direct light upon
adjacent property or rights-of-way.
      3.   Signs Adjacent To Residential Areas: Any illuminated sign located on
a lot abutting or across a right-of-way from, and visible from, any
residentially zoned area shall not be illuminated between the hours of eleven
o'clock P.M. and seven o'clock A.M. except that such sign may remain
illuminated during such time as the activity to which the sign pertains is open
for business so long as such sign is not a public or private nuisance.
      4.   Flashing Lights Prohibited: No flashing, blinking or intermittent
lights shall be permitted.
   C.   Electrical Elements: All wiring, fittings and materials used in the
construction, connection and operation of artificially illuminated signs shall
be in accordance with the provisions of this code. No metal sign illuminated by
any means requiring internal wiring and no electrical fixtures attached to any
sign shall be lower than nine feet from grade unless it is grounded by the use
of a grounding conductor run with the circuit conductors and is also grounded
by being bonded to a grounding electrode at the sign site.
   D.   Structural Elements: The construction and structural components of all
signs shall be in accordance with the standards and regulations of this code.
All permanent signs shall be constructed of fire-resistant materials and shall
be capable of withstanding wind pressures of at least thirty pounds per square
foot of surface area and of receiving dead loads based on the actual weight of
the structure.
   E.   Minimum Elevation of Certain Signs: The bottom of every awning, canopy,
marquee, wall and pylon sign shall be elevated at least eight feet above grade.
Whenever possible wall signs on the same facade shall maintain the same top and
bottom elevations above grade.

obstruct any window surface required for light or ventilation by any applicable
provision of this code.
   H.   Traffic Safety:
      1.   Confusion with Traffic Signals: No sign shall be maintained at any
location where by reason of its position, size, shape, content, color or
illumination it may obstruct, impair, obscure, interfere with the view of or be
confused with, any traffic control sign, sign or device or where it may
interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic.
      2.   Obstruction of Sight Triangles Prohibited: No sign, nor any part of
a sign other than a supporting pole or brace no greater than eighteen inches in
width or diameter shall be located lower than eight feet from grade within the
area of any sight triangle as defined in this code.
   I.   Signs in Rights-of-Way: Except as provided in this subsection, no sign
except governmental signs authorized in this chapter shall be placed in or
extend into or over any public property or right-of-way.
   J.   Sign Identification: All signs shall be plainly marked with the name of
the person, firm or corporation hanging or erecting the sign and the sign
permit number.
   K.   Sign Maintenance: The owner of a sign and the owner of the premises on
which such sign is located shall be jointly and severally liable to maintain
such sign, including its illumination sources, in compliance with this code and
all applicable laws, in a safe and secure condition, and in a neat and orderly
condition and good working order at all times, and to prevent the development
of any rust, corrosion, rotting or other deterioration in the physical
appearance or safety of such sign. The premises around ground and pylon signs
shall be kept clean and free of all rubbish and weeds.
   L.   Sign Measurement:
      1.   Sign Area: Unless otherwise defined, sign area is determined by the
total area enclosed by a continuous perimeter along the edges of a sign,
including any sign area backing. The area of a sign composed of individually
affixed letters is determined by total area of the smallest geometric shape
enclosing the letters. A maximum of two geometric shapes may be utilized. The
calculation for a double-faced sign shall be the area of one face only.

with the provisions of this chapter is unlawful, is declare a nuisance and
shall constitute a violation and petty offense. A separate offense shall be
deemed committed for each day any violation of any provision of this chapter
shall continue. Liability for the violation or offense shall be with the
applicant, should the violation or offense be related to a sign erected and
maintained pursuant to a permit issued by the village. Liability for the
violation or offense shall be with the owner of the property on which the sign
exists, should the violation or offense be related to a sign erected and

the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these Critical Facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts, or impoundment Structures. Underground water storage tanks are not

      1.   Result in increased premium rates for Flood insurance up to amounts
as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage; and
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the Applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the Applicant will acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   E.   The findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the Corporate
Authorities according to this Section, the notifications required by this
Section, and a record of hearings and evidence considered as justification for
the issuance of all variances from this Chapter shall be maintained by the
Village. (Ord. 3852, 1-10-2022)
4-12-11: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of Flood Protection required by this Chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger Floods may
occur, or Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
Chapter does not imply that Development, either inside or outside of the
Floodplain, will be free from flooding or damage. This Chapter does not create
liability on the part of the Village or any officer or employee thereof for any
Flood damage that results from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 3852, 1-10-2022)
4-12-12: PENALTY:
   A.   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit for Development in
the Floodplain or failure to comply with the conditions of a floodplain
development permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this
Chapter. Upon due investigation, whenever the Director of Public Works
determines that a Violation of the minimum standards of this Chapter exists,
the Director of Public Works shall issue a Notice of Violation. The Notice of
Violation constitutes a suspension of the permit.
The Notice of Violation shall contain the address or parcel identification
number of the property, a brief description of the Violation; Section of the
Ordinance violated; the requirement to stop all work in Violation of this
Chapter; a statement informing the violator that they may contest the notice in
writing within ten days, correct the violation in ten days, or apply for a
permit; a warning that if the violator fails to comply the Village shall
institute appropriate legal proceedings; and a statement that the Ordinance
authorizes fines of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each day during or on which a Violation
occurs or continues.
Notification to the owner shall be in any of the following manners:
      1.   By personally delivering to the owner of the property involved, or
to the owner's agent, or to the person doing the work;
      2.   By posting a copy of the stop work order on the subject property in
a conspicuous place;
      3.   By personally delivering or mailing a copy of the notice of
violation to any adult who resides at, occupies, uses, leases, manages, or
maintains the property on which the Violation is located; or
      4.   By personally delivering or mailing a copy of the notice of
violation to any owner in title to the property on which the Violation is
located.
   B.   If such owner fails, after ten days from the date the written notice is
issued, to correct the violation, apply for a permit, or contest the notice in
writing, the Village may make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this Chapter or make such other order as
the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with the Ordinance.
   C.   Any person who violates this Chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
   D.   The Village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   E.   The Director of Public Works shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase Flood damages and, therefore
may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
   F.   No floodplain development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Corporate Authorities. Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for complaint or reasons for suspension or revocation;

5-8-1: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
Because it is recognized that maintenance of a vigorous urban forest is an
integral part of the infrastructure of the village and is important and
essential to the health, well being and welfare of the residents of the village
it is the intent of the village to maintain tree lined parkways by planting and
maintaining trees at all locations where space and conditions are appropriate.
Further, this chapter is designed to provide a means to properly regulate
activities impacting trees and shrubs in the village. (Ord. 2806, 12-14-1998;
amd. Ord. 3932, 7-8-2024)
5-8-2: PLANTING, MAINTENANCE OR REMOVING:
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any person to plant any tree or shrub in any

approval of the Director. All trees planted by the Village shall be planted
consistent with the most current edition of American National Standards
Institute and shall be tree species identified as well-suited for the planting
site, based on the Morton Arboretum Northern Illinois Tree Species List. Trees
purchased by the Village shall be of a quality consistent with the most current

      2.   The location of the tree or shrub; and
      3.   The health of the tree or shrub; and
      4.   The reason for removal or relocation; and
      5.   The environmental impact of removal or relocation.
   If because of emergency weather or other casualty conditions a tree is
endangering health, safety or property and requires immediate removal, verbal
authorization may be given by the Director for the tree removal without
obtaining a written permit. Such verbal authorization shall later be confirmed
in writing by the village.
   C.   The Director or their designee shall have the right to plant, prune,
remove and maintain any plants, trees or shrubs located on the village right of

meter fails to operate, and the consumer shall pay the amount estimated by the
director of public works. (1981 Code)

5-11-16: CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL:
   A.   The purpose of the cross connection control program is to protect the
public water supply system from contamination or pollution by isolating within
the customer's water system contaminants or pollutants which could backflow
through the service connection into the public water supply system; and promote
the elimination or control of existing cross connection, actual or potential,
between the public or consumer's potable water system and nonpotable water
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable quality; and provide
for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control which
will prevent the contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's
potable water systems. If in accordance with the Illinois plumbing code or in
the judgment of the director of public works or his or her designee, an
approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public
water supply system, the director of public works or his or her designee, shall
give notice to the water customer to install and maintain such an approved
device immediately. The water customer shall, at its own expense, install the
device at a location and in a manner in accordance with the Illinois plumbing
code and all applicable state and village laws, regulations, and ordinances,
and the water customer shall permit inspections and tests made of such approved
devices to be made, as required by the Illinois environmental protection
agency, Illinois plumbing code, or village laws, regulations, and ordinances.
   B.   No person, firm, or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public

village, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the
method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by both
the director of public works and the Illinois environmental protection agency.
   C.   It shall be the duty of the director of public works to cause surveys
and investigations to be made of all properties served by the public water
supply to determine whether actual or potential hazards to the public water
supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of
public record and shall be repeated at least every two years, or as often as
the director of public works shall deem necessary. Records of such surveys
shall be maintained and available for review for a period of at least five
years.
   D.   The licensed cross connection control device inspector shall have the
right to enter, upon reasonable prior written notice, at any reasonable time
any property served by a connection to the public water supply or distribution
system of the village for the purpose of verifying the presence or absence of
cross connections. The director of public works or his or her designee shall
have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice, to enter at any
reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water supply
or distribution system of the village for the purpose of verifying information
submitted by the customer regarding the required cross connection control
inspection. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served
shall furnish to the director of public works or his or her designee any
information which he may request regarding the piping system or systems or
water use on such property. The refusal of such information, when demanded,
shall, within the discretion of the director of public works or his or her
designee, be deemed evidence of the presence of improper connections as
provided in this section.
   E.   The director of public works of the village is hereby authorized and
directed to discontinue, after reasonable written notice to the occupant
thereof, the water service to any property if any connection in violation of
the provisions of this section is known to exist, and to take such other
precautionary measures as he may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of
contamination of the public water supply distribution mains. Water service to
such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been eliminated
or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this section, and until a
reconnection fee as set forth in subsection 5-10-5B2 of this title, is paid to
the village. An immediate disconnection with oral notice may be ordered by the
director of public works or his or her designee when an imminent danger of
harmful contamination of the public water supply system exists. Such action
shall be followed by written notification of the cause of disconnection. An
immediate disconnection without notice shall be permitted to prevent actual or
imminent contamination or pollution on the public water supply, provided that,
in the reasonable opinion of the director of public works or his or her
designee, the plumbing inspector, or the Illinois environmental protection
agency, such action is required to prevent actual or imminent contamination or
pollution of the public water supply. If an immediate disconnection without
notice is made, oral or written notice shall be given within a reasonable time
thereafter.
   F.   Any water consumer who causes, permits, or allows back siphoned or back
pressured material, or contamination through backflow, if contamination of the
potable water supply system occurs through an illegal cross connection or an
improperly installed, maintained or repaired device, or a device which has been
bypassed, shall bear all costs of cleanup of the potable water supply system.
Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this section
may be fined up to two hundred fifty dollars for each offense and a separate
offense shall be deemed to have been committed on each day during which a
violation occurs or continues. (Ord. 3369, 5-9-2011)
5-11-17: USE OF GROUNDWATER AS A POTABLE WATER SUPPLY PROHIBITED:
   A.   The use of groundwater as a potable water supply by the installation or
use of potable water supply wells or by any other method is prohibited.
      1.   The use or attempt to use as a potable water supply, groundwater
from within the corporate limits of the village by the installation or drilling

writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the director of public works is
satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter
and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the
director of public works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.
   B.   Additional Village Review Of Applications Of Telecommunications
Retailers:
      1.   Pursuant to section 4 of the telephone company act, 220 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the village
that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the village not less than ten days prior to the
commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty days
prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The director of public
works shall specify the portion of the right of way upon which the facility may
be placed, used and constructed.
      2.   In the event that the director of public works fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: a)
ten days after service of notice to the village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction, or
b) twenty five days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer
in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter.
      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to this chapter, the telecommunications
retailer shall submit to the village an application for a permit and any and
all plans, specifications and documentation available regarding the facility to
be constructed. Such application shall be subject to the requirements of
subsection A of this section.
   C.   Withholding Action On An Application: The village shall not be required
to take action on any application if the applicant is otherwise in violation of
this chapter, title 3 or 4 of this code or any existing franchise agreement.
Upon correction of such violation, the village shall proceed to review the
application in accordance with this section.
   D.   Limitation On Permit Application For Subsequent Work: No excavation
shall be permitted in any public right of way which has been constructed,
reconstructed, repaired or resurfaced within the previous five years unless the
excavation is shown in a long-range plan submitted to the village at least two
years prior to the application. Upon one hundred eighty days' prior notice, the
village may require any excavation shown in a long- range plan to be done in
conjunction with any proposed work being conducted in the same area. (Ord.
2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights of way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights of way.
   B.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village, and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
The permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village
within ninety days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall be submitted on paper and in an electronic format
approved by the director of public works. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
5-14-21 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-8: INSURANCE:

license, or similar agreement, each utility and any contractor or subcontractor
of each utility occupying a right of way or constructing any facility in the
right of way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the village, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed below:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         a.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each person;
         b.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any one
accident; and
         c.   Five million dollars for all other types of liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars for personal injury and property
damage for each accident;
      3.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars per employee and per accident.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be cancelled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to
cancel or not to renew.
Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event
later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and
furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   E.   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection A of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections
B and C of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall so state in
its permit application and provide the village with evidence satisfactory to
the village sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
coverages and limits required under subsection A of this section.
   F.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   G.   License And Financial Resources Required: Any insurance company
providing coverage in compliance with this section shall be licensed in the
state of Illinois and have financial resources satisfactory to the village.

Each permit application shall contain a statement that by occupying or
constructing facilities in the right of way, the utility agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold the village and its elected and appointed officials and
officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any
and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses,
including reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out
of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the acts or
omissions of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of
the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this
chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement. The utility's
indemnity obligations shall not apply or extend to any injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting
from the negligence of the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents
or representatives. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, the permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an
amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall not relieve the utility of its obligations to insure and
indemnify the village, or to be liable to the village for damages. The security
fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter; and
      2.   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits, and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location within the state of Illinois at which it
can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit is to be performed in
phases and/or in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting
of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations,
and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to
substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the
director of public works may allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the
permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal
to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of
this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the
fourteen day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to pay or reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs
or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of
any action, inaction or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen days after receipt of written notice
from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified pursuant to
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee shall be entitled to any interest which may be
generated by its security fund, less estimated costs of administration, and may
request that net interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be
returned to it by the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not
reduce the security fund below the minimum balance stipulated pursuant to
subsection C of this section. The village shall not be required to deposit the
security fund in an interest-bearing account paying prevailing rates.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after an account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the village. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the
security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village provided that amounts in excess of said
costs, loss or damage, if any, shall be refunded to the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. The withdrawal of funds by the village
shall be credited to the permittee with respect to any claim which the village
may have, but shall not operate as a waiver, estoppel or satisfaction, or
otherwise prevent the village from recovering additional funds or seeking other
legal relief to which it may be entitled. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-11: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:
   A.   Village Right To Revoke Permit: The village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      1.   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete

to comply with the provisions of this section, the village or its designee may,
at the option of the village: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2) upon not less
than twenty days' notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or
equipment; 3) after not less than thirty days' notice to the permittee of
failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the
village; 4) exercise its rights under section
5-14-9 of this chapter; or 5) sue the permittee for an injunction and/or

A utility or permittee shall notify the village in writing no less than thirty
days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility located in the right of
way or change in identity of the utility, stating the name, address and
telephone number of the proposed new owner. Any new owner of the utility or the
facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former
owner under any pending permit and all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and facilities in
the right of way. All required insurance coverage or bonding shall be changed
to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)

highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right- of-way line and any aboveground
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   B.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement

provided in the initial installation.
      6.   Markers: The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 CFR 192.707 (1989)).
   C.   Facilities To Be Located Within Particular Rights Of Way: The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights of way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   D.   Appearance Standards:
      1.   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the highway user or impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
   E.   Aboveground And/Or Overhead Installations: Aboveground or overhead
facilities may be installed only if:
      1.   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      2.   New underground installation is not technically feasible;
      3.   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable; and
      4.   The village approves the location, size and, at the village's
option, the facility is screened from view.
   F.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routes available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         d.   The proposed method of attachment;
         e.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         f.   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         g.   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         h.   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-16: CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS:
   A.   Standard Methods And Requirements For Particular Types Of Construction
Methods:
      1.   Boring Or Jacking:
         a.   Pits And Shoring: Boring or jacking under rights of way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the director
of public works from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or jacking shall
be excavated no more than forty eight hours in advance of boring or jacking
operations and back- filled within forty eight hours after boring or jacking
operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and
protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced,
and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads
that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
         b.   Wet Boring Or Jetting: Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         c.   Borings With Diameters Greater Than Six Inches: Borings over six
inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and following
pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside diameter of
the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).
         d.   Borings With Diameters Six Inches Or Less: Borings of six inches
or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking, guided with auger,
or auger and following pipe method.
         e.   Tree Preservation: Any facility located within the drip line of
any tree designated by the village to be preserved shall be bored under or
around the root system.
      2.   Trenching: Trenching for facility installation, repair, or
maintenance on rights of way shall be done in accord with the applicable
portions of section 603 of IDOT's "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction".
         a.   Length: The length of open trench shall be kept to the
practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless written
permission is obtained from the director of public works.
         b.   Open Trench And Excavated Material: Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by chapter 6 of the Illinois
manual on uniform traffic control devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         c.   Tree Drip Line: The utility shall not trench within the drip line
of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      3.   Backfilling:
         a.   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT's "Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction". When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         b.   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled. If so ordered by the utility, at its
expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the
installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and
restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as
determined by the director of public works.
      4.   Pavement Cuts: Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this subsection A4 is
permitted under this chapter, the following requirements shall apply:
         a.   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled as soon as
practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as designated by
the director of public works.
         b.   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         c.   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         d.   For all rights of way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last five
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a JULIE
locate.
      5.   Encasement:
         a.   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         b.   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         c.   In the case of a water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village-approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty psig or less, encasement
may be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty psig, encasement may be eliminated only if
extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         f.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right of way.
      6.   Minimum Cover Of Underground Facilities: Cover shall be provided and
maintained at least in the amount specified in the following table for minimum
cover for the type of facility:
 
Type Of Facility                           Minimum Cover

general order 160 of the Illinois commerce commission) entitled "Rules for
Construction of Electric Power and Communications Lines", and the national
electrical safety code.
         b.   Overhead Facilities: Overhead power or communication facilities
shall use single pole construction and, where practicable, joint use of poles
shall be used. Utilities shall make every reasonable effort to design the
installation so guys and braces will not be needed. Variances may be allowed if
there is no feasible alternative and if guy wires are equipped with guy guards
for maximum visibility.
         c.   Underground Facilities:
            (1)   Cable may be installed by trenching or plowing, provided that
special consideration is given to boring in order to minimize damage when
crossing improved entrances and side roads.
            (2)   If a crossing is installed by boxing or jacking, encasement
shall be provided between jacking or bore pits. Encasement may be eliminated
only if: a) the crossing is installed by the use of "moles", "whip augers", or
other approved methods which compress the earth to make the opening for cable
installation, or b) the installation is by the open trench method which is only
permitted prior to roadway construction.
            (3)   Cable shall be grounded in accordance with the national
electrical safety code.
      2.   Underground Facilities Other Than Electric Power Or Communication

1 1. 220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.
5-14-17: VEGETATION CONTROL:
   A.   Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming shall not be considered a
normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
code.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurances that the work will be accomplished by
competent persons with supervision experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees shall be grounds for cancellation of the tree- trimming permit
and for assessment of damages. The village shall be entitled to compensation
for trees extensively damaged or removed without authorization. The formula
developed by the international society of arboriculture will be used as a basis
for determining the compensation for damaged trees or unauthorized removal. The
village may require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical
pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.
      3.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
   B.   Chemical Use: Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not
be permitted on rights of way unless the utility demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the director of public works that such spraying is the only
practicable method of vegetation control. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)

   A.   Notice: Within ninety days following written notice from the village, a
utility shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate,
change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights of way
whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal,
relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction,
repair, maintenance, or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or
the operations of the village in or upon, the rights of way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty days following
written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights of
way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the public rights of way. A facility is unauthorized and
subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   C.   Emergency Removal Or Relocation Of Facilities: The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights of
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   D.   Abandonment Of Facilities: Upon abandonment of a facility within the
public rights of way of the village, the utility shall notify the village
within thirty days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the director of public
works determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public
health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the
utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of
abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent
to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another
utility or person. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:
Upon completion of all construction or maintenance of facilities, the utility
shall remove all excess material and restore all turf, vegetation, sidewalks,
curbs, other structures and/or terrain in a timely manner and to the
satisfaction of the village. This includes restoration of entrances and side
roads. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and
methods approved by the director of public works. Such cleanup and repair may
be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any
other requirement to restore the right of way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project.
(Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)

with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
director of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all commercially reasonable
means to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   C.   Emergency Repairs: The utility must file in writing with the village of
a description of the repairs undertaken in the right of way within forty eight
hours after an emergency repair. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)

authority to grant a variance for each provision of this chapter identified in
the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The director of public works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
objectives and intent of this chapter. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-22: PENALTIES:
In addition to any damages and/or costs to which the Village may be entitled
pursuant to this chapter, any person or entity who (which) violates, disobeys,
omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter, or an order from the Director of Public Works, or his/her designee,
shall be subject to a fine of up to seven hundred fifty dollars per day for
each day, or part thereof, the violation continues. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-23: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-24: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter
is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof. (Ord. 2898, 11-13-2000)
5-14-25: APPEALS:
Any order, directive or decision of the Director of Public Works made or given
pursuant to this chapter may be appealed to the Village Board. Any appeal shall
be in writing, shall state the grounds for the appeal and shall be filed with
the Village Administrator within ten business days of receipt of the order,
directive or decision being appealed. The Village Board shall hear the appeal
no later than the second regular Board meeting after it is filed unless the

wireless facility may not interfere with the frequencies used by a public
safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider must
install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause
unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications
equipment. Unacceptable interference is determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith
effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
Village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the
interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited
above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a
public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the
procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this Code.

decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the Village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small
wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the Village shall
either:
         a.   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         b.   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   F.   Collocation Limits: Wireless providers shall not collocate small
wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric
distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone
of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subsection, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

shall apply for a Village beekeeping permit.
At the time of application for a Village beekeeping permit, the applicant shall

confirmed by the Village prior to establishment of the colony or colonies on
the new lot, and so long as the notification requirements of section
8-14-3 of this chapter are satisfied and confirmed by the Village prior to
establishment of the colony or colonies on the new lot.
   E.   State Registration: All permittees shall register the apiary on the lot
with the State of Illinois Department of Agriculture and maintain their

maintained so as not to become stagnant.

feet from all of the lot's property lines, and oriented so that flight patterns
face away from the closest lot fence line on the lot.
   B.   Flyways: A hive shall be placed on a lot so that the general flight
pattern of the bees is in a direction and distance that will deter bee contact
with humans and domesticated animals. If this cannot be achieved due to lot
constraints, the beekeeper shall install a fly-wall at least two feet higher
than the hive entrance, and no more than five feet from said entrance. The fly-
wall shall be made of vegetation or fencing material.
   C.   Fencing: If the lot where a hive is located is not completely fenced
in, the beekeeper shall erect a fence and/or barrier around the hives
themselves that will be at least four feet high and no closer than five feet
from the hive. The requirements of this subsection C shall not apply to a hive
on a rooftop.
   D.   Signage: A weatherproof sign at least ten inches by ten inches shall be
installed at either the entrance(s) of the yard or the entrance to the fence
erected around a hive in a non-fenced in yard. The sign shall read "State
Registered Beehive(s) on Property" or similar language that makes it clear that
bees are on the premises. The Village-issued permit number must be included and
displayed clearly. (Ord. 3666, 11-27-2017)

By accepting a permit under this chapter, a permittee shall have agreed to:
   A.   Waive and relinquish any and all claims, demands or causes of action of

Village affiliates from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
claims, injuries, illness, death, damages or losses of any kind, penalties,
causes of action, costs and expenses brought by any person, including any

with beekeeping and the activities allowed under the permit.

9-7-3: NOTICE OF SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT:
   A.   Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle
is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, and the police
officer has effected an arrest for any of the offenses set forth in subsection
9-7-2B of this chapter, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the
vehicle to a facility authorized by the Chief of Police. Prior to the vehicle
being towed, the police officer shall notify any person identifying himself as
the owner or lessee of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control
of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, and who is physically
present at the scene, that the vehicle will be seized and impounded, and that
the owner or lessee has the right to request a preliminary vehicle impoundment
hearing and participate in an administrative hearing. If the owner or lessee is
present at the scene, the police officer shall inform the owner or lessee that
he/she has a right to make a written request for a preliminary vehicle
impoundment hearing within forty eight hours of the seizure in accordance with
the provisions of section
 9-7-4 of this chapter. If the owner or lessee of the vehicle is not present at
the scene, the Village shall send the owner or lessee written notice of the
seizure and impoundment by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the
address listed on the owner or lessee's vehicle registration within twenty four
hours of impoundment, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or Village holidays. Said
notice shall inform the owner or lessee that he/she has the right to request a
preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing within forty eight hours of the owner
or lessee's receipt of the notice in accordance with section
 9-7-4 of this chapter. The Village shall also provide notice that said motor
vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearings provided for
in this chapter, unless the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle or a
lienholder of record posts with the Village a cash bond as set forth in section
9-7-5 of this chapter.
   B.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, the
arresting police officer may release the vehicle prior to towing if the vehicle
subject to seizure and impoundment was not owned by the person placed under
arrest and the registered owner or person legally authorized to possess the
vehicle shall arrive at the scene of the arrest prior to the actual removal or
towing of the vehicle and the lawful owner or person lawfully entitled to
possession of the vehicle possesses a valid operator's license, proof of
ownership or registration, proof of liability insurance and would not, as
determined by the arresting police officer, indicate a lack of ability to
operate the motor vehicle in a safe manner, or who would otherwise, by
operating the motor vehicle, be in violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
   C.   Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the
preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing provided for in section
 9-7-4 of this chapter, unless the owner or lessee of the vehicle or a
lienholder posts with the Village a cash bond, or pays by money order or
certified check to the Village of River Forest the amount of five hundred
dollars, plus any accrued towing and storage charges. (Ord. 3415, 4-9-2012)
9-7-4: PRELIMINARY HEARING:
If the owner of record or lessee of a vehicle seized and impounded pursuant to
this chapter desires to appeal the seizure, said owner or lessee must make a
request for a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing within forty eight hours
of the seizure, or within forty eight hours of receipt of notice by the owner
or lessee of the seizure if the owner or lessee was not present at the time of
the seizure. Said request shall be in writing and filed with the Chief of
Police or his designee who shall conduct such preliminary hearing within forty
eight hours after receipt of the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or
Village holidays. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to be heard at the preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing. The
formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence
shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably
prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the
Chief of Police or his designee determines by a preponderance of the evidence
that the vehicle was properly subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to
this chapter, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as
provided in this section, unless the owner or lessee of the vehicle or a
lienholder posts with the Village a cash bond, or pays by money order,
certified check, or approved credit card service the amount of five hundred
dollars, plus any applicable towing and storage fees. If the Chief of Police or
his designee determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was
improperly seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the vehicle will be
returned without penalty or other fees. (Ord. 3415, 4-9-2012)
9-7-5: FINAL ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING:
   A.   Unless the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle prevails at a
preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing held pursuant to section
9-7-4 of this chapter, or the owner or lessee affirmatively waives his/her
right to a final administrative hearing, within ten business days after a motor
vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the Village shall
notify the owner of record, or lessee and any lienholders of record by personal
service or first class mail, of the date, time and location of a hearing that
will be conducted pursuant to this section. The notice shall state the fees
that may be imposed, and that a motor vehicle not released by cash bond or
other form of payment acceptable to the Village may be sold or disposed of by
the Village in accordance with applicable law.
   B.   The final administrative hearing shall be conducted and held, unless
the owner or lessee prevailed at a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing,
affirmatively waives the hearing, or the hearing is continued by order of the
Hearing Officer, no later than forty five days after the motor vehicle was
seized. The hearing shall be conducted and the case decided by a Hearing
Officer appointed by the Village Administrator. All interested persons shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to
the hearing date, the Hearing Officer may, at the request of either party,
direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules
of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons
in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the Hearing Officer
determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle, operated
with the permission, express or implied of the owner or lessee, was properly
subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the Hearing
Officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record or lessee of the motor
vehicle civilly liable to the Village for an administrative fee in an amount of
five hundred dollars and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded
until the administrative fee is paid to the Village, plus any applicable towing
and storage fees. If the owner of record or lessee fails to appear at the
hearing, the Hearing Officer shall enter a default order in favor of the
Village, a copy of which shall be sent to the registered owner or lessee via
certified mail, return receipt requested. If a cash bond or other acceptable
form of payment has been posted, that amount shall be applied to the amount
owed. If the Hearing Officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
vehicle was improperly seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the
Hearing Officer shall order the immediate return of the owner or lessee's
vehicle or cash bond without fees. All orders issued by the Hearing Officer
shall be in writing.
   C.   If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to section
9-7-2 of this chapter, such fee shall constitute a debt due and owing to the
Village. If a cash bond or other form of monetary payment acceptable to the
Village has been posted pursuant to this chapter, such amount shall be applied
to the administrative fee. If a vehicle has been impounded when such an
administrative fee is imposed, the Village may seek to obtain a judgment on the
debt and enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except
as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded
until the administrative fee is paid to the Village and any applicable towing
and storage fees are paid to the tower, in which case possession of the vehicle
shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle, or
the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a
lien as provided by law. If the administrative fee and other applicable fees
are not paid within thirty five days after an administrative fee is imposed
against an owner of record or lessee who defaults by failing to appear at the
hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the
manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other
cases, if the administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid within
thirty five days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of
the Hearing Officer's determination may be sought, or within thirty days after
an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the
Village, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code. Unless stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or administrative fee imposed under
this chapter which remains unpaid in whole or in part after the expiration of
the deadline for seeking judicial review under the Administrative Review Act
may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.
   D.   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law or if the Hearing
Officer found by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was
improperly seized and impounded, no owner, lienholder, or other person shall be
legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this chapter
until the administrative fee and other applicable fees under this chapter have
been paid in full. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an
impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the
vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund
to the Village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any
amounts required to pay all lienholders of record, not to exceed the
administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees. (Ord. 3415, 4-9-2012)
   E.   If the Hearing Officer finds that the Village exceeded its authority
under this chapter in the seizure and impoundment of a motor vehicle, the
Village shall be liable to the owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle
for the cost of storage fees and reasonable attorney fees. (Ord. 3620, 10-24-
2016)
9-7-6: APPEAL:
Any party may appeal a final decision of the Hearing Officer pursuant to the
provision of the Illinois Administrative Review Act. (Ord. 3415, 4-9-2012)

When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor vehicle
entering an intersection in violation of section
9-8-2 of this chapter, the village shall issue a written "notice of violation"
to the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by
U.S. mail within thirty days after the Illinois secretary of state notifies the

address recorded in a United States post office approved database of the owner
or lessee of the cited vehicle. The second notice shall be made by first class

A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law violation shall
require a review of the associated recorded image by the traffic compliance
administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the motor
vehicle was being operated in violation of section
9-8-2 of this chapter, or whether one of the defenses enumerated in section
9-8-3 of this chapter is visibly and plainly applicable upon inspection. Upon
determination that the recorded image captures a violation and that no defense
applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle
owner in the manner provided for above. The traffic compliance administrator
shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and other
correspondence mailed to the owner of the vehicle. Each notice of violation
shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is
admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of the above noted statutory
and local provisions and shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject
to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in this chapter.
The notice of violation shall include the following information:

may result in an additional late fee being assessed against the owner or
lessee;
   I.   The amount of the late fee;

hearing by the date specified will result in a final determination of liability

9-8-5: HEARING:
The registered owner to whom a notice of violation was issued may request a
hearing by the respond by date on the notice of violation (within twenty one
days from the date of issuance), to challenge the evidence or set forth an
applicable defense. The notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the
facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a
violation of section
9-8-2 of this chapter. The notice of violation shall be prima facie evidence of
a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in
section

The owner's failure to appear at the hearing will result in a finding of
liability. In the event of a failure to appear, a "findings, decision and
order" letter will be sent to the owner. The owner's failure to pay the amount
by the date specified in that letter will result in a final determination.

9-8-6: NONRESIDENTS:
Where the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle is not a resident of
the village but seeks to contest the merits of the alleged violation, such
person may contest the charges using the same available defenses as stated
above, but rather than attend an administrative hearing, the nonresident
registered owner may submit any and all documentary evidence to the traffic
compliance administrator by the respond by date on the notice of violation
(within twenty one days from the date of issuance), together with a written
statement reflecting that they are a nonresident of the village. The traffic
compliance administrator shall forward all timely submitted materials to the
hearing officer for review and determination. (Ord. 3387, 8-15-2011)

A final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to
pay the fine, a failure to request a hearing by the respond by date, after a
hearing officer's determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or
failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by this code.
Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in
the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's
determination shall become final upon a failure to pay the amount owed on date
provided in the "findings, decision and order" letter. Appeal may be made to
the circuit court of Cook County on any final determination as provided for by
the Illinois administrative review act. (Ord. 3387, 8-15-2011)

registered owner indicating that a fine in the amount of one hundred dollars is
due to the village. The notice will also state that the owner may petition the
village to set aside the determination of liability before it becomes final. If
the owner does not pay the one hundred dollars as specified in the notice or
petition the village to set aside the determination, within twenty one days, a
notice of final determination will be sent to the owner indicating that the
owner has exhausted all challenge options and the one hundred dollar fine is a
debt due and owing to the village and must be paid within fourteen days. The
owner will also be notified that the failure to pay the one hundred dollar fine
within fourteen days will result in a late fee of one hundred dollars added to
the original fine. (Ord. 3387, 8-15-2011)
9-8-9: NOTICE OF FINAL DETERMINATION:
A "notice of final determination" shall be sent following the final

following information:
   A.   A statement that the unpaid fine is a debt due and owing to the
village.
   B.   A warning that a failure to pay any fine due and owing to the village

suspension of the person's driver's license for failure to pay fines or
penalties for five or more violations under this chapter. (Ord. 3387, 8-15-
2011)
9-8-10: PETITIONS TO SET ASIDE DETERMINATION:

shown to set aside the determination. If cause has been shown, the village
shall forward the petitioner a new hearing date on which the petitioner must
appear to present his case. The village shall notify the petitioner of the
hearing officer's decision to grant a hearing or deny the petition within
fourteen days of the village's receipt. (Ord. 3387, 8-15-2011)
9-8-11: NOTICE OF IMPENDING DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION:

violations of this chapter. The notice of impending driver's license suspension
shall state the following information:

the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under section
6-306.5 of the Illinois vehicle code;
   B.   A statement that the person may obtain a copy of the original ticket
imposing a fine by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the village

regulations of the Zoning Title that merit review in hearing and require
approval as stated in subsection E. A major variation may be granted only when

this Zoning Title, where the variation is the only variation required for the
structure or use.

Zoning Title which is not dealt with in subsection B above.
      2.   A reduction of the applicable off-street parking or loading
facilities, where proposed use and other practical uses have been shown not to
necessitate the number of parking spaces required by this Zoning Title.
      3.   An increase in the maximum distance that required parking spaces are
permitted to be located from the use served.
      4.   The use of the same off-street parking facility to qualify as

continue or remain.
      6.   Any zoning requirements which are not covered under minor variations
in this Section.
   D.   Procedures for Minor Variations:
      1.   Upon acceptance of a completed application for a minor variation,
the Zoning Administrator shall cause a notice of the requested variance to be
sent to all owners of property within two hundred fifty feet of the subject
property. Such notice shall indicate the nature and location of the requested
minor variation and shall invite written comment regarding the merits or
potential impact of the variation to be given to the Zoning Administrator
within fifteen days of the date of the notice.
      2.   If, after fifteen days, the Zoning Administrator, after considering
the application and the written comments, if any, shall:
         a.   Make a finding that the requested minor variation does not pose a
threat to health, safety, welfare or enjoyment on the subject site or on other
property within the Village, and is appropriate to the reasonable use of the
property and surrounding properties; and shall issue the minor variation as
requested.
         b.   Make a finding that the requested minor variation poses a threat
to health, safety, welfare or reasonable enjoyment on the subject site or on
the property within the Village, or is not appropriate to the reasonable use of
the property or surrounding properties; and shall deny the minor variation as
requested.
      3.   If the Zoning Administrator denies a minor variation, the applicant
may appeal such decision as set forth in Section
10-5-6 of this Chapter.
   E.   Procedures for Major Variations:
      1.   Upon acceptance of a completed application for a major variation,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing thereon at such time
and place in the Village as it shall determine. Notice of such public hearing,
indicating the requested variance, shall be published at least fifteen days and
not more than thirty days in advance of such hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Village. Said notice shall be sent to all owners of property
within two hundred fifty feet of the subject property.

hearing by the Zoning Board of Appeals, nor without a written report or
recommendation thereof having been made by the Zoning Board of Appeals to the
Board of Trustees, and every such report shall be accompanied by findings of
facts specifying the reasons for the recommendation.
      3.   Upon the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals, the Board of
Trustees, without further public hearing, may adopt or deny any major variation
or may refer the report back to the Zoning Board of Appeals for further
consideration. Any such variation which fails to receive the approval of four
members of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall not be passed except by the
favorable vote of two-thirds of the Board of Trustees. In making any such
variation, the Board of Trustees shall be governed by the same considerations,
restrictions and standards as apply to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      4.   Advance written notice of the first meeting of the Village Board
where a major variation application will be considered shall be provided by
regular mail to the owners of record of the property which is the subject of
the application (if different from the applicant), and the owners of all
property within two hundred fifty feet of the subject property, not less than
seven days prior to the date of the first Village Board meeting. This
requirement is enacted to assure the most complete public notice possible for
the proposed major variation, it is not required by State law. Accordingly, any
failure to comply with this subsection shall not invalidate, impair or
otherwise affect any major variation subsequently granted following such
meeting.
   F.   Standards for Major Variations: A major variation shall be recommended
by the Zoning Board of Appeals only if it makes findings, based upon the
evidence presented to it, that each of the following standards has been met:
      1.   The physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the
specific property involved will bring a specific hardship upon the owner as
distinguished from an inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations
were to be carried out;
      2.   The aforesaid unique physical condition did not result from any
action of any person having an interest in the property, but was created by
natural forces or was the result of governmental action, other than the
adoption of this Zoning Title, for which no compensation was paid;
      3.   The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based may
not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification;
      4.   The purpose of the variation is not based predominantly upon a
desire for economic gain;
      5.   The granting of the variation shall not be detrimental to the public
welfare or unduly injurious to the enjoyment, use, or development value of
other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is
located; or,
      6.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of fire, or
otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair
property values within the neighborhood;
      7.   That the granting of the variation would not unduly tax public
utilities and facilities in the area;
      8.   That there is no means other than the requested variation by which
the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or remedied to a degree
sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the subject property.
   G.   Conditions on Variations: The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose
specific conditions, which relate to the purposes and objectives of this Zoning
Title, upon the premises benefitted by a variation. Such conditions shall be
expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the variation. Violation of any
such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Zoning Title and
shall constitute grounds for revocation of the variation.
   H.   A Variation is Not a Zoning Amendment: Nothing herein contained shall
be construed to give or grant to the Zoning Board of Appeals the power or
authority to alter or change the Zoning Title, such power and authority being
reserved to the Board of Trustees; however, the Zoning Board of Appeals may
make recommendations to the Board of Trustees with respect to any alteration or
change of this Zoning Title in such specific cases as may properly come before
the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   I.   Status of Variation Granted: Subject to an extension of time not to
exceed sixty days granted by the Village Administrator, no order of the Board
of Trustees permitting a variation from the provisions of this Zoning Title
shall be valid for a period longer than nine months, unless such use or
structure is initiated within such period; provided, however, that where such
use permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such
order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit for erection or
alteration is obtained within such period of nine months and such erection or
alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms
of such permit.
      1.   A variation shall be deemed to authorize only the particular
construction or development which was applied for. A variation shall
automatically become null and void if such construction or development is
removed and not replaced within nine months following such removal.
   J.   Filing Fees: There shall be charged a filing fee, as may be adjusted
from time to time by the Village Board, for each application for a change of
any property from one use district to another use district or for each
application for allowance of variation from the provisions of this Zoning Title
as applicable to any property. (Ord. 2640, 5-23-95)

nonconforming use or building shall not be enlarged or altered; however, in an
R1 and R2 district, an enlargement or alteration may be permitted by the zoning
administrator, provided the actual extension or enlargement itself conforms to
all the provisions of this zoning title (in the event the existing building is
nonconforming, the maximum allowable height shall be the existing height of the
building or the R1 and R2 district height limitation, whichever is greater).
The replacement in kind of a porch, addition, or any other appurtenances to the
main building which is nonconforming, shall be permitted provided it does not
increase the nonconformance of the building. The replacement of an accessory

violation of this zoning title may be ordered removed or corrected by the
proper officials at any time. (Ord. 2640, 5-23-1995)
CHAPTER 6
ZONING DISTRICTS
SECTION:
10-6-1: Establishment of Districts
10-6-2: Zoning District Boundaries, Map
10-6-3: Interpretation of District Boundaries
10-6-1: ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS:
In order to classify, regulate and restrict the location of businesses and
industries, and the location of buildings designed for specified uses; to
regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected or
altered; to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of lot areas, and to
regulate and determine the area of yards, courts and other open spaces within
and surrounding such buildings, the village is hereby divided into nine classes
of districts. The use, height and area regulations shall be uniform in each
class of districts, and said districts shall be:
   C1 Commercial District
   C2 Commercial District
   C3 Central Commercial District
   ORIC Office/Research/Industrial/Commercial District
   PRI Public, Recreational and Institutional District
   R1 Wide Lot Single-Family Residential District
   R2 Single-Family (Detached) Residential District
   R3 Single-Family (Attached) Residential District
   R4 Multi-Family Residential District
(Ord. 2640, 5-23-95)
10-6-2: ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES, MAP:
   A.   The boundaries of the districts mentioned in Section
10-6-1 are shown upon a map hereby made a part of this Zoning Title, which map
is designated as the "Zoning District Map". The Zoning District Map and all the
notations, references and other matters shown thereon shall be as much a part
of this Zoning Title and have the same force and effect as if the notations,
references and other information set forth thereon where all fully set forth or
described herein, which Zoning District Map is properly attested, and is on
file in the office of the Village Administrator. To the extent that the Zoning
District Map conflicts with the text contained in this Zoning Code, however,
the text shall prevail.
   B.   The boundaries of the River Forest Historic District have been overlaid
on the Zoning District Map solely to recognize the significance the District
holds for the Village and is for informational purposes only. There are no
regulations in this Title which exclusively affect those properties located
within the Historic District boundaries. The significance of the River Forest
Historic District (entered in the National Register of Historic Places on
August 26, 1977) lies primarily in the Village’s architecture, especially in
those buildings embodying the revolutions in design developed in the late
Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries by Frank Lloyd Wright and his
contemporaries.

10-6-3: INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the Zoning District Map, as hereinabove described, the
following rules shall apply:
   A.   The district boundaries are either streets or alleys unless otherwise
shown, and when the designations on the said Zoning District Map indicate that
the various districts are approximately bounded by street or alley lines, said
street or alley shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
   B.   Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated and where the
property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
district boundaries shall be construed to be lot lines, and where the
designations on the Zoning District Map indicate that the various districts are
approximately bounded by lot lines, said lot lines shall be construed to be the
boundaries of such district, unless said boundaries are otherwise indicated on
the Zoning District Map.
   C.   Where the district boundaries are not shown by streets or alleys, or
lot or block lines, the district boundaries shall be determined solely by the
dimensions shown on the Zoning District Map.
   D.   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall make the final determination on any
question of district boundaries. (Ord. 2640, 5-23-95)

10-19-5: Procedures
10-19-6: Application Requirements
10-19-7: Effect Of Approval Or Denial
10-19-8: Amendments And Alterations To Approved Planned Development Permits
10-19-1: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   One of the principal objectives of this zoning title is to provide for
a compatible arrangement of uses of land and buildings which is consistent with
the requirements and welfare of the village. To accomplish this objective most
uses are classified as permitted or special uses in one or more of the
districts established by this zoning title. It is recognized, however, that
there are certain uses, whether or not designated as permitted or special,
which because of their scope, location or specific characteristics give rise to
a need for a more comprehensive consideration of their impact both with regard
to the neighboring land and the village in general. Such uses as fall within
the provisions of this section shall only be permitted if authorized as a
planned development.
   B.   The board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards
set forth in this section, may grant planned development permits authorizing
the establishment of planned developments.
   C.   Planned developments may include uses or combinations of uses currently
permitted in the underlying zoning district and those uses which are currently
prohibited or special uses provided for elsewhere in this zoning title.
However, an applicant may petition for consideration of a use or combination of
uses not specifically allowed in the underlying zoning district provided that
the village board finds that the conditions, procedures and standards of this
section are met and provided further that such use or combination of uses is
clearly shown to be beneficial to the village and surrounding neighborhood.
   D.   It is the purpose of planned developments to enable the granting of
certain allowances or modifications from the basic provisions of this zoning
title to achieve attractive and timely development in furtherance of the
village's objectives and proposed land uses as stated in the comprehensive plan
and policy resolutions of the village board.
   E.   Through the flexibility of the planned development process, the village
seeks to achieve the following specific objectives:
      1.   Creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible
through strict application of other village land use regulations.
      2.   Promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related
physical facilities resulting in better design and development, including
aesthetic amenities.
      3.   Combination and coordination of the character, the form, and the
relationship of structures to one another.
      4.   Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such
as natural topography, vegetation, and geologic features.
      5.   Provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space, or
an increase in the amount of open space over that which would result from the
application of conventional zoning regulations.
      6.   Encouragement of land uses or combination of uses that maintain the
existing character and property values of the village, and promote the public
health, safety, comfort, and general welfare of its residents.
      7.   Promotion of long term planning pursuant to a master plan which will
allow harmonious and compatible land uses or combination of uses with
surrounding areas.
   F.   The development of village owned buildings or property shall be exempt
from the requirements of this section. (Ord. 3587, 2-29-2016)
10-19-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   No development of twenty thousand square feet or more of land area or
gross floor area and no multi-family housing of any size shall be permitted
unless approved as a planned development in accordance with this chapter.
Provided, however, that: 1) this chapter shall not apply to the construction,
reconstruction or remodeling of one single- family detached dwelling unless the
proposed project is submitted pursuant to subsection B of this section, and 2)
this chapter shall not apply to the reconstruction or restoration of any
existing structure which is damaged to the extent of less than fifty percent of
its value unless the proposed project is submitted pursuant to subsection B of
this section.
The reconstruction or restoration of any existing multi- family housing which
is damaged to the extent of fifty percent or more of its value shall be
governed by this chapter and not subsection
10-5-7A2 of this title.
   B.   The development of any parcel or tract of land in any zoning district,
irrespective of size, may be submitted to the village for consideration as a
planned development.
   C.   Approval of a planned development permit must be obtained in accordance
with the provisions of this section if both of the following conditions exist:
      1.   The proposed development involves a parcel of land held in common
ownership with a contiguous parcel which obtained approval as a planned
development within three years prior to the date of this application; and
      2.   The parcel proposed for development, when combined with the
contiguous parcel that is held in common ownership with the subject parcel,
equals or exceeds the general provisions contained in subsection A or B of this
section.
   D.   Each planned development should be presented and judged on its own
merits. It shall not be sufficient to base justification for approval of a
development upon an already existing planned development except to the extent
such development has been approved as part of a master plan.
   E.   The burden of providing evidence and persuasion that any planned
development permit is necessary and desirable shall in every case rest with the
applicant.
   F.   Buildings and uses or combination of uses within a planned development
shall be limited solely to those approved as part of this title granting a
planned development permit provided, however, that any buildings and uses or
combination of uses in compliance with the master plan approved as part of this
title granting a planned development permit may be approved by the Development
Review Board and the Village Board of Trustees.
   G.   Any applicant shall be subject to a penalty of up to seven hundred
fifty dollars per day to be assessed against the applicant and recorded as a
lien against the applicant's property in the Village for failure to comply with
any condition, contingency or master plan submitted by the applicant or imposed
by the Village to comply with this chapter. (Ord. 3587, 2-29-2016)

      4.   Notice of the public hearing and the application shall be posted to
the village's website at least fifteen days before the public hearing.
The removal or unavailability of such notice on the village's website prior to

applicant by regular mail to the owners of record of the property which is the
subject of the application (if different than the applicant), and the owners of
all property within five hundred feet of the subject property as shown on the
written list provided by the applicant pursuant to the requirements of 65

standards and requirements established by this section, the report of the
zoning administrator, and any oral and written comments received by the
development review board before or at the public hearing. Within forty five
days following the close of the public hearing, the development review board
shall make specific written findings addressing each of the standards set forth

property which is the subject of the application (if different from the
applicant), and the owners of all property within five hundred feet of the
subject property, not less than seven days prior to the date of the first
village board meeting. This requirement is enacted to assure the most complete
public notice possible for the proposed application for a planned development,
it is not required by state law. Accordingly, any failure to comply with this
subsection shall not invalidate, impair or otherwise affect any planned
development permit subsequently granted following such meetings. The applicant
shall provide the zoning administrator with proof of mailing of the mailed
notice required herein, which proof shall be provided prior to the start of the
first meeting of the village board where the planned development application
will be considered.

of this section shall require the concurrence of a majority of all the trustees
of the village then holding office, including the village president; however,

review board, the ordinance shall not be approved except by a favorable
majority vote of all trustees then holding office.

   H.   A planned development permit shall be null and void if the use or
combination of uses for which the approval was granted ceases for a period of
one year.
   I.   No application for a planned development which was previously denied by

      1.   The zoning administrator shall review the application for a planned
development and determine if the application is or is not substantially the
same. An applicant has the right to request a hearing before the village board

10-19-8: AMENDMENTS AND ALTERATIONS TO APPROVED PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PERMITS:
   A.   Except as provided in subsection B of this section, any modifications
to a project operating under an approved planned development permit or any
addition to or expansion of a project operating under an existing planned
development permit shall require separate review and approval under the
provisions of this section.
   B.   A minor change is any change in the site plan or design details of a
project operating under an approved planned development permit which is
consistent with the standards and conditions applying to the project and which
does not alter the concept or intent of the project.
A change is not minor if it, with regard to the approvals granted in the
planned development permit:
      1.   Increases the density;
      2.   Increases the height of buildings, unless the proposed height change
is less than or equal to the lesser of: a) the height permitted in the
property's zoning district regulations in effect as of the date the planned
development permit is approved, or b) the height permitted in the property's
zoning district regulations in effect as of the date the minor amendment is
requested;
      3.   Increases the footprint of a building;

provides any other change inconsistent with any standard or condition imposed
by the board of trustees in approving the planned development permit.
A minor change may be approved by the zoning administrator without obtaining
separate approval by the board of trustees. In addition, the village board may,
after reviewing the request for a minor change made by the village staff or the
applicant, direct the village administrator to process the minor change
administratively. A minor change that would constitute a variation under the
zoning title may only be approved at the direction of the village board. Any
minor change approved by the zoning administrator shall be reported to the
village board. (Ord. 3587, 2-29-2016)

as determined by the Village Board from time to time.
   F.   No public utility company shall furnish any new or additional meters to
any building or to the owner, occupant or occupants thereof until it has
received a written permit to do so from the Director of Public Works. This
subsection shall have no application to the mere exchange of meters for repair
or service, or to the furnishing of temporary service.
   G.   No certificates of occupancy shall be issued for buildings, parcels or
tracts of land in the R1, R2, R3, R4, C1, C2, C3, ORIC and PRI Districts until
the following information and accompanying data is submitted to the Village for
administrative review:
      1.   The names and addresses of the owner of the subject property, the

10-23-2: PLATS:
Each application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a plat in
duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built
upon, the size of the building to be erected, its location upon the lot, and
such other information, including off-street parking, as may be necessary to
provide for the enforcement of this Zoning Title. A complete record of such
applications and plats shall be kept in the office of the Director of Public
Works. (Ord. 2640, 5-23-1995)
10-23-3: SUBDIVISION PLATS:
   A.   All persons subdividing any piece of land, block, lot or sublot, or any
part thereof, in the Village shall make a map or plat thereof, and before
recording the same in the Recorder's office of the County, as provided by law,
shall submit the same, with three additional copies thereof, to the President
and Board for their approval or rejection, as they may deem proper provided
that said plat shall comply to all applicable zoning requirements unless a
variation to said requirements has been granted by the Village. If approved,
such approval shall be certified thereon, and signed by the Village President
and attested by the Village Clerk; and no such map or plat shall be valid or
entitled to be recorded until it shall have been approved as aforesaid.
   B.   The duplicate of such map or plat as provided in subsection A of this
Section shall be kept on file by the Village Clerk for the use and benefit of
the Village. No such map or plat shall be approved as aforesaid until the same
shall have been properly certified by a surveyor and acknowledged by the owner,
as provided by the laws of the State. (Ord. 2733, 8-11-1997)
   C.   From and after October 11, 1994, no subdivision of any piece of land,
block, lot or sublot, or any part thereof, in the Village shall be approved by
the President and Board unless each resulting lot is equal to or greater in
width than the average width of all lots within the same block, consisting of
both sides of the street and measured by the closest intersecting street on
each side; provided further, however, that each said resulting lot shall have a
width of not less than fifty feet and that corner houses shall be deemed to
front on their respective north/south streets.
   D.   Where two or more lots are combined for the construction of one single-
family dwelling, said lots will be construed as one lot for purposes of
calculating the average width of lots within the same block. (Ord. 2640, 5-23-
1995)
10-23-4: DEDICATIONS OF SCHOOL LANDS OR PAYMENTS OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF:
As a condition of approval of a certificate of occupancy for the use of a new
residential structure or a residential structure or structures that replace an
existing structure, or as a condition of approval of a final plat of
development, a final plat of subdivision, or a final plat of or special use
permit for a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be
required to dedicate land for school purposes to serve the immediate and future
needs of the residents and children of the development, or make a cash
contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at
the option of the Village, in accordance with the criteria and formula that
follow. For the purposes of this Section, "school" and "school district" shall
refer only to public elementary school districts.
   A.   Criteria For School Land Dedication:
      1.   Requirements And Population Ratio: The ultimate population density
of a proposed development, subdivision or planned unit development shall bear
directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The
land dedication requirement shall be determined in accordance with the data for
the estimated number of children entering school per type of dwelling found in
the latest edition of the table prepared by Associated Municipal Consultants,
Inc., which table is reproduced as a density formula in subsection C of this
Section.
School classifications and size of school sites within the Village shall be
determined in accordance with the following criteria based upon
"Recommendations for Elementary and High School Spaces", published by the
Illinois State Board of Education, Springfield, Illinois:
 
School Classification Maximum Number Of Students Minimum Number Of
By Grades                                        Acres Of Land
Elementary            600                        11
Junior high           900                        29
 
      2.   Location: The Comprehensive Plan of the Village, the comprehensive
school plan or facility utilization plan of the school district and the
standards adopted by the school district shall be considered in locating school
sites. The location of dedicated school sites shall be determined with the
input of the school district involved. A central location which will serve
equally the entire development is most desirable. Additional guidelines which
shall be considered in locating sites include, but are not limited to, size of
the subdivisions, proximity of the site to other schools and Municipal
services, topography and shape of the site, accessibility of the site, safety
and other environmental and use conditions.
   B.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of School Land: Where the
subdivision or development is small and the resulting school site is, in the
opinion of the Village, after consultation with the school district, too small
to be practical or when the available land, in the opinion of the Village,
after consultation with the school district, is inappropriate for school
purposes, the Village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash
contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash contributions in
lieu of school land dedication shall be paid to and held in trust by the school
district in which the development is located, solely for the acquisition of
land for school sites and/or the types of improvements of school land, as set
forth in subsection B2 of this Section which will be available to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that development, subdivision or
planned unit development or for the improvement of other existing local school
land which already serves such needs. The Village shall have the right to
request and receive from the affected school district's annual audit reports
and any other information the Village may need from time to time to ensure
compliance with this Chapter. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of
school land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within
ten years from the date of receipt, the school district holding the funds shall
refund such contribution to the owners of record of all lots, except lots
dedicated pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, in the development,
subdivision, or planned unit development for which such contribution was made.
The refund shall be paid to the persons who are the owners of record on the day
which is the tenth anniversary of the receipt of such contribution. The amount
of the refund due to each lot owner shall be equal to the amount of the
original contribution, together with such interest as may have been earned
thereon, divided by the total number of lots in the development, subdivision or
planned unit development (excluding only those lots which were dedicated
pursuant to this Chapter) for which such contribution was made.
      1.   Acquisition Using Cash In Lieu Of School Land Donations:
         a.   The term "acquisition" as used in this Chapter shall mean "the
acquiring of land by purchase, condemnation or such other means as may be
appropriate".
         b.   The acquired land shall be used for the construction of new
facilities or shall support the types of improvements as set forth in
subsection B2 of this Section.
      2.   Improvement Using Cash In Lieu Of School Land Donations: Where
existing school lands will serve the needs of the development, the cash
contribution in lieu of land dedication shall be used for the following types
of physical improvements: expansion of existing school facilities, including
remodeling to allow the accommodation of additional students in the facility,
additions to existing facilities, additions to school grounds and environment,
purchase or lease of prefabricated units and costs of a capital nature related
to any of the foregoing.
      3.   Fair Market Value: The cash contribution in lieu of improved land
shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the
development. It has been determined that the present fair market value of such
improved land in and surrounding the Village is four hundred twenty nine
thousand one hundred dollars per acre and such figure shall be used in making
any calculation herein unless the subdivider, developer, or the school district
involved files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection,
the objecting party shall, at its cost, submit an appraisal by a Member of
Appraisal Institute (MAI) showing the fair market value of the land in the
development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said fair
market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the Village Board
based upon such information submitted by the subdivider, developer, or school
district involved and from other sources which may be submitted to the Village
Board by others. Any developer, subdivider or school district involved shall
have a reasonable opportunity to dispute any appraisal submitted under this
Section and to submit a contrary appraisal before the Village Board makes a
final decision as to any adjustment to the fair market value, except that the
Village in conjunction with the school district involved may from time to time
submit amendments to this provision to provide for different fair market values
for parcels that are deemed by the school district involved and the Village to
be of greater or lesser value.
      4.   Adjustment Of Fair Market Value: The fair market value as
established in this Section shall be adjusted from time to time as deemed
necessary by the Village. Such adjusted fair market value shall be used in
making calculations thereafter until further adjustment by the Village or
unless the subdivider, developer or the school district involved files a
written objection thereto. The objecting party shall follow the procedure for
objecting set forth in subsection B3 of this Section. In determining the fair
market value of an improved acre of land, the land shall be valued as if
subdivided or subject to an approved planned unit development at its highest
and best use and improved substantially as provided in subsection G of this
Section.
      5.   Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Fee: There may be situations
when both a land dedication and a cash contribution are necessary. These
occasions may arise, among others, when:
         a.   If it is determined by the Village that the land to be dedicated
for a school site within a development contains fewer acres than the amount
called for by this 3Chapter, a cash contribution shall be required for the
difference between the amount of land called for by this Chapter and the amount
of land which is actually to be dedicated.
         b.   If a major part of a local school site has already been acquired
and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the
site, the remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash
contribution for the difference shall be required.
   C.   Density Formula: The following table of population density is generally
indicative of current and short-range projected trends in family size for new
construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication
of acres of land or the cash contribution in lieu of unless a written objection
is filed thereto by the subdivider, developer, or school district:

Note: There are only 3 significant categories provided in this chart, because
of the similarity of yields of all types of attached single-family dwelling
units, only 1 category is provided. The same is true with apartments; thus,
only 1 category. Because of the relatively short history of some newer types of
detached and attached single-family units, individual evaluations may be
necessary. Copyright 1993 Illinois School Consulting Service Associated
Municipal/Consultants, Inc. Naperville, Illinois.
      1.   Objections to Density Formula: In the event a subdivider, developer
or school district involved files a written objection to the Table of Estimated
Ultimate Population listed herein and submits his own demographic study showing
the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or
planned unit development, a final determination of the density formula to be
used in such calculations shall be made by the Village Board based upon such
demographic information as the Village shall require. It is recognized that
population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the
years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of
fees in-lieu-thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and
amendment if necessary.
      2.   Presumed Density Formula: In applying the above table of population
density to a development or subdivision for which the types of units and number
of bedrooms cannot reasonably be determined from the data on file with the
Village at the time the application for final plat approval is complete, the
following types of units and bedroom data shall be used unless written
objection is filed thereto by the subdivider, developer or school district:
 
Detached single-family: Four bedroom unit per lot.
Attached single-family: Equal mix of two and three bedroom units at maximum
                        unit density permitted by applicable zoning.
Low density apartment:  Equal mix of two and three bedroom units at maximum
                        unit density permitted by applicable zoning.
High density apartment: Equal mix of one and two bedroom units at maximum unit
                        density permitted by applicable zoning.
 
   D.   Reservation of Additional Land: Where the Comprehensive Plan of the
Village calls for a larger amount of school land in a particular proposed
development, subdivision or planned unit development than the developer is
required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution
shall, if so determined by the Village Board, be reserved for subsequent
purchase by the Village or other public body designated by the Village provided
that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the
final plat.
   E.   Combining with Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision or planned
unit development is less than forty acres, school space which is to be
dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining
developments in order to produce usable recreation areas or school sites
without hardship on a particular developer.
   F.   Topography and Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for school uses shall not differ greatly
from surrounding land.
   G.   Improved Sites: All sites shall be graded to a level condition
reasonably conforming with the adjacent property and suitable for construction
and operation of a school and dedicated in a condition ready for full service
of electricity, natural gas, water, sewer, sidewalks, street trees, storm water
control and streets, including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter.
   H.   Title to Sites: All sites to be dedicated shall be conveyed to the
Village either by warranty or trustee's deed, or such form of conveyance as the
Village shall require. The subdivider or developer shall be responsible for
conveying good, merchantable title to such sites, and shall be responsible for
payment of all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance, including any
agricultural roll back taxes which might be extended or levied against such
sites. A commitment for title insurance issued by a company authorized to do
business in Illinois, for the benefit of the school district and at the expense
of the subdivider or developer, shall be required as evidence of clear title.
Conveyance shall occur only after or simultaneously with the passage of a
resolution by the school district in which the development is located in which
it indicates that the property will be accepted by the school district for
school purposes. Immediately thereafter, the Village shall convey such property
to the Township Trustees of Schools, for the use and benefit of the appropriate
school district.
   I.   Replacement Structures: Where a subdivider or developer has applied for
a certificate of occupancy for the use of a residential structure or structures
that replace an existing structure, the subdivider's or developer's obligation
under the terms of this Section shall be modified as follows:
      1.   If the replacement structure is a multi-family residential
structure, the formula for determining the required land dedication or impact
fee as set forth in subsection J shall be calculated using the increase in the
number of units in the replacement structure as compared to the original
structure.
      2.   If the replacement structure is a single-family residential
structure and there is no increase in the number of structures, it shall be
considered a de minimis increase in density and shall be exempt from the
obligations of this Section.
      3.   If the replacement structures are single-family residential
structures and the original structure remains, the land dedication/impact fee
requirement shall be applied only to the new structures.
      4.   If the replacement structures are single-family residential
structures and no original structure remains, the land dedication/impact fee
requirement shall be applied only to the increased number of structures. It is
the intent of this Title that the land dedication/impact fee requirement shall
first be applied to those structures with the largest amount of square footage,
or, if the square footage is equal, then inversely to the order in which the
application for the certificate of occupancy was filed.
   J.   Calculation of Land Dedication or Payment In-Lieu-Thereof:
      1.   The required land dedication or payments in lieu thereof under this
Chapter shall be calculated as follows:
         Step 1. Derive the children per unit (CPU) figures from the density
formula (subsection C) for the development type of K-5 children (CPU
elementary) and 6-8 children (CPU junior high) and multiply each by the number
of units (U). If the structure is a replacement multi-family residential
structure as defined in subsection I, the number of units (U) shall be the
increase in the number of units in the replacement structure from the original
structure or structures.
         A separate calculation shall be done for the CPU elementary and the
CPU junior high.
         Step 2. Divide the Step 1 figure by the maximum number of students for
elementary (maximum elementary) or junior high (maximum junior high)
(subsection A1).
         Step 3. Multiply the Step 2 figure by the corresponding minimum number
of acres for the type of school (minimum A. elementary, minimum A. junior
high).
         Step 4. If a payment in-lieu-of dedication is required, multiply the
Step 3 figure by the fair market value F.M.V. (subsection B3).
If both a dedication of land and a payment-in-lieu of dedication is required
under subsection B4, the dedication and payment amounts shall be calculated by
applying the CPU ratable for each figure.
      2.   Formula and Sample Calculations. The formula for dedications and
payments-in-lieu thereof is expressed as follows:
      elem.
   (C.P.U. j.h. x U)       elem.
   ______________________    x Min. A. j.h. x F.M.V. =
      elem.
   Max. j.h.
   Sample Calculation:    Elementary (K-5) District
Positioning a 4 bedroom single-family detached development of 20 units, and a
fair market value of $429,100.00 per acre, the calculation would be as follows:
   CPU elem. x U   .470 x 20 = 9.4
   ÷ Max. elem.       9.4 ÷ 600 = .01567
   x Min A. elem.      .01567 x 11 = .17237
            acres required dedication
   If payment in lieu-of-dedication,
   x F.M.V.      .17237 x $429,100.00 =
            $73,963.67
For an elementary school district consisting of grades K-8, the product of the
calculation for grades K - 5 would be added to the product of the calculation
for grades 6-8, to reach the final required dedication or payment.
   K.   Annexation: The dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu
thereof required by this Chapter shall also be required as a condition to the
annexation of any land to the Village, and provisions therefor shall be
incorporated in any pre-annexation agreement governing such land.
   L.   Time for Dedication or Payment of Fees In-Lieu-Thereof: The dedication
of school lands or payments of fees in-lieu-thereof shall be made by the owner
of land within ten days after the land is annexed to the Village or prior to or
at the time of the approval of the certificate of occupancy, the final plat of
subdivision, or a final plat of, or issuance of a special use permit for, a
planned unit development, whichever is first to occur.
   M.   Expenditure of Cash Contributions: Any cash contributions received by a
School District hereunder must be spent for land or other improvements intended
to serve children residing within the corporate limits of the Village.
   N.   Effective Date: This Section's requirement of dedication of school
lands or payments of fees in lieu thereof shall apply only to those structures
for which the application for building permit was filed after the Section's
effective date of June 2, 1995. (Ord. 2640, 5-23-95)

foster aesthetically pleasing development which will protect and preserve the
appearance, character, general health, safety and welfare of the village of
River Forest. In addition, these regulations are intended to increase the
compatibility of adjacent uses that are different, such as commercial uses
adjacent to residential uses, by requiring a buffer or screen between them. In
doing so, this will minimize the harmful impact of noise, dust and other
debris, motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions and
other objectionable activities or impacts conducted or created by adjoining or
nearby uses. (Ord. 2960, 4-8-2002)

must not release any additional quantities or increase rates of runoff onto
adjacent properties than existed prior to the construction. (Ord. 2960, 4-8-
2002)
10-24-5: TREE PRESERVATION:
It is the purpose and intent of this section to establish regulations limiting
the removal and ensuring the replacement of trees from multi-family
residential, commercial, institutional and governmental property within the
village and, in doing so, safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment of
the community. These regulations are further intended to serve to dissuade the
unnecessary clearing and disturbing of land so as to preserve, insofar as
practical, the existing natural trees, and preserve existing landscaping
buffers to minimize the impact of adjoining differing land uses, enhance and
protect the integrity of roadway corridors, and reduce the surface heat and
negative visual impact of vehicular use areas.
   A.   Tree Removal:
      1.   Approval Required: No tree having a trunk size of six inches or
greater in diameter as measured twelve inches above the established ground
levels, shall be removed from any multi-family residential, commercial,
institutional and governmental property requiring building permit approval as
set forth in this code, or which is the subject of a petition for a zoning
variation or subdivision in the village, without written approval from the
zoning administrator or his authorized designee. In cases where only a zoning
variation is sought, only those trees that are to be removed as a result of the
construction that requires the variation shall be subject to these regulations.
Undesirable species of trees such as those described in section
10-24-10 of this chapter shall be exempt from these regulations. A written
statement indicating the reasons for removal of trees and a general description
of the trees to be removed shall accompany the application for tree removal.
      2.   Conditions Of Approval: The zoning administrator or his authorized
designee shall approve all requests for tree removal if one or more of the
following conditions is present:
         a.   Safety Hazard To Pedestrians Or Vehicular Traffic: Necessity to
remove trees that pose a safety hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic or
threaten to cause a disruption of public safety.
         b.   Safety Hazard To Buildings: Necessity to remove trees which pose
a safety hazard to a building.
         c.   Diseased Or Weakened Trees: Necessity to remove diseased trees or
trees weakened by age, storm, fire or other injury.
         d.   Observe Good Forestry Practice: Necessity to observe good
forestry practice, i.e., the number of healthy trees a given parcel of land
will support.
         e.   Location Of Proposed Structure: Necessity to remove trees in
order to locate proposed structure(s) without causing unreasonable economic
hardship.
         f.   Grade Changes: Necessity to remove trees in order to provide for
essential grade changes.
      3.   Replacement Trees: Any trees that have been identified for removal
must be replaced in accordance with the following criteria:
         a.   Replacement trees shall either:
            (1)   Equal or exceed the same size caliper as the tree removed; or
            (2)   Consist of smaller trees, not less than three inches in
caliper, which add up to the caliper of the original tree.
         b.   All replacement trees shall be selected from the village's
recommended species list (see section
10-24-10 of this chapter).
         c.   Replacement trees shall be documented on the final landscape
plan.
         d.   Replacement trees may be used for required perimeter yard
landscaping and screening on the subject property.
   B.   Protection Of Existing Trees During Construction:
      1.   Tree Survey: A tree survey shall be submitted at the time of an
application for building permit approval indicating the location, size and
species (both scientific and common) of all trees located on the parcel with a
trunk size of six inches or greater, as measured twelve inches above the
established ground level.
      2.   Integration Of Existing Trees Into Site And Landscape Plans: Subject
to the determination of the zoning administrator, every reasonable effort shall
be made to retain existing trees on the aforementioned trees survey through the
integration of those trees surveyed into the site and landscape plan for the
proposed development. Removal of trees designed for preservation shall only be
allowed by amendment to the approved landscape plan.
      3.   Tree Preservation Plan: A tree preservation plan shall be submitted
at the time of an application for site plan and architectural approval
indicating, at a minimum, the location of those trees to be preserved and the
methods which are to be used to preserve such trees. The tree preservation plan
shall specify the following preservation techniques:
         a.   Grading, Construction Equipment And Materials: All grading and
construction equipment and materials shall be forbidden from encroaching upon
the tree's drip line.
         b.   Materials Detrimental To Trees: Crushed limestone or any other
materials that may be detrimental to trees shall not be dumped within the drip
line of any trees nor shall be located at any higher location where drainage
toward the tree(s) could conceivably affect the health of said tree(s).
         c.   Storage Of Vehicles: No materials or vehicles shall be stored,
driven or parked within the drip line of any trees.
         d.   Installation Of Snow Fencing: Snow fencing, or an alternative
temporary barrier, with the written approval of the zoning administrator or his
authorized designee, shall be installed at the periphery of the tree's drip
line to protect trees from root compaction by the storage of materials or
vehicles.
         e.   Pruning: Identification of any trees which have to be saved, but
which could be negatively affected during the construction process. All such
trees shall be pruned by a qualified arborist to compensate for root loss
during construction.
         f.   Preservation Methodology: The methods that are to be used to
preserve those trees shall be clearly specified. If, in the opinion of the
zoning administrator, or his authorized designee the necessary precautions, as
specified in the tree preservation plan for the development, were not
undertaken before or during construction to ensure the preservation of those
trees, the site development permit for the parcel shall not be issued, or if
previously issued, may be revoked until such time as compliance with the
precautions is achieved.
         g.   Consultant: The village shall, at its discretion, have the right
to retain a professional tree consultant/forester to review the preservation
plans and to submit a written report to the zoning administrator. All expenses
incurred by the village shall be reimbursed by the developer.
         h.   Village Right To Inspection: The village shall have the right to
inspect the subject property at any time during the construction process, in
order to verify that the developer and contractor have protected trees in
accordance with the approved tree preservation plan.
      4.   Removal Of Trees Designated For Preservation: If it is determined by
the village that a tree designated for preservation is destroyed or razed
during the construction process by a deliberate action in violation of the
approved tree preservation plan, such tree shall be replaced with new trees in
accordance with the following exchange rate. Village staff may, with just
cause, waive the following exchange rate due to accidental damage to protected
trees:
         a.   Exchange Rate:
 
Existing Trees      Number Of Replacement Trees
(In Caliper Inches)
36+                 1" for each 1" of tree removal
30-35               11
26-29               10
20-25               9
13-19               8
6-12                7
 
   C.   Trunk Size: Trunk size as measured at twelve inches above the
established ground. For the above, in the event of a fraction of an inch, if
the fraction is less than one-half inch, it may be disregarded. If the fraction
is one-half or greater, it shall be counted as one inch.
   D.   Minimum Size Of Replacement Trees: All replacement trees shall be a
minimum trunk size of three inches in diameter, as measured six inches above
the established ground.
   E.   Payment In Lieu Of Replacement Trees: If it is determined by the
village that an insufficient area exists which would support any or all of the
replacement trees, the property owner shall contribute one hundred percent of
the dollar value (as determined by the most recent valuations of the
international society of arboriculture) of the replacement trees to the
village. Said funds shall be used for the sole purpose of planting trees at
locations determined by the village. (Ord. 2960, 4-8-2002)
10-24-6: MAINTENANCE:
All property owners shall be responsible for the maintenance, repair, and
replacement of all required landscape materials.
   A.   Grass shall be maintained at a height not in excess of eight inches.

This section describes general standards; tree planting standards; hedge
planting standards; shrub planting standards; and ground cover planting
standards.
   A.   General Standards: To ensure installation of plants that will thrive
under stressful urban conditions, certain species must be encouraged. The
standards listed in this section will help prevent the planting of trees that
become hazards, maintenance problems, or a scar on the landscape.
   B.   Quality:
      1.   Plants shall meet the standards of "American Standard for Nursery
Stock", ANSI Z60.1 latest edition, American association of nurserymen, which by
reference is made a part of these guidelines. References to minima and maxima
with respect to plant height and spread, root ball diameter and depth, etc.,
are from this publication.
      2.   Plants shall meet all requirements of federal, state, and local law
with respect to plant type, labeling, nursery or plant inspection, disease,
insect, and other pest infestation, and any other requirements.
      3.   Plants shall be high quality nursery grown stock.
      4.   Substandard "B-grade" or "park grade" plants are not acceptable.
      5.   Field collected plants are not acceptable, even if they have been
subsequently planted in the ground in a nursery or planted in a container.
      6.   Plants shall have been grown in a climate zone similar to River
Forest's, i.e., United States department of agriculture (most recent USDA zone
hardiness map) zone 4 or 5 (zone 5 plants are generally hardy only near the
warming influence of Lake Michigan). Plants from zone 6B or more, i.e., warmer
climate zones, are not acceptable.
      7.   Plants shall be in a healthy, vigorous condition, free of dead or
broken branches, scars that are not completely healed, frost cracks,
disfiguring knots, broken or abraded bark, redundant leaders or branches,
rubbing branches, or aberrations of any kind. Plants shall not have multiple
leaders, unless this is the natural form; multistem trees are not acceptable
for required planting in parkways.
      8.   Plants shall have full, even, well developed branching and a dense,
fibrous, and vigorous root system.
   C.   Digging And Handling:
      1.   Balled and burlapped (B&B) plants shall be dug with a firm root ball
of natural earth, of a size in proportion to the plant's size, as measured by
caliper, height, or spread.
      2.   Balled and burlapped plants shall be handled only by the root ball,
not by the trunk or branches, as this may break or loosen the root ball and
damage the root system.
      3.   Container plants shall have been established for a minimum of one
full growing season in their containers before installation.
      4.   Container plants shall be handled only by the container, not by the
stems or branches, as this may pull the plant out of the container and break or
loosen the root ball and damage the root system.
      5.   Bare root shrubs and ground cover plants are acceptable, if they are
dug and installed at the appropriate season and handled in the appropriate
manner.
      6.   Bare root trees are not acceptable.
      7.   Plants shall be protected from drying out during shipping with
tarpaulins or other covering.
      8.   Plants shall be protected from drying out after delivery by planting
immediately; if this is not possible, the root ball shall be covered with peat
moss or earth, and watered frequently to keep it moist until planting.
      9.   Not handled, moved, bound, tied or otherwise treated so as to damage
the root ball, roots, trunk, or branches in any way.
   D.   Inspection:
      1.   During construction, parkway trees will be inspected by the village
forester to confirm compliance with this chapter. If the trees fail to meet the
requirements of this chapter, they must be replaced at the owner's expense. At
the end of five years, the village forester will perform an acceptance
inspection. If the project is approved, the village will then assume
responsibility for the trees in the public right of way.
      2.   Standards for size are at time of installation.
      3.   Minimum size shall be two and one-half inch caliper, measured six
inches aboveground.
      4.   Trees shall have a clear trunk, free of branches, to a minimum

IMAGES/0-0-0-2398.png]
Such revenue stamps shall be available for sale at, and during the regular
business hours of, the village offices. Upon payment of the tax herein imposed
and upon completion of the zoning inspection and issuance of the zoning
certificate of occupancy provided for in section
11-2-3 of this chapter, the purchase of the revenue stamps shall be completed
and the revenue stamps so purchased shall be affixed to the deed or other
instrument of conveyance. Any person so using and affixing a revenue stamp or
stamps shall cancel it and so deface it as to render it unfit for reuse by
marking it with his initials and the day, month and year when the affixing
occurs. Such markings shall be made by writing or stamping in indelible ink or
by perforating with a machine or punch. However, the revenue stamp(s) shall not
be so defaced as to prevent ready determination of its denomination and
genuineness. (Ord. 2916, 2-12-2001)
   I.   Real Estate Transfer Declaration; Filing: A signed copy of the real
estate transfer declaration filed pursuant to section 3 of the real estate

assignment of beneficial interest in nonexempt real estate located in River
Forest special service area number one without first obtaining a statement of
consideration from the assignor and assignee and unless revenue stamps in the
required amount, as set forth in this chapter, have been affixed to the
assignment. (Ord. 2119, 5-9-1983, eff. 7-1-1983)

conveying nonexempt real estate within River Forest special service area number
one without the revenue stamps provided by this chapter, a lien is declared
against said real estate conveyed in the amount of the tax. The fact that the
deed does not contain a River Forest revenue stamp in an amount equal to the
amount of the state transfer tax shall constitute constructive notice of the
lien. In addition, the village administrator may record a lien for the
nonpayment of the tax provided for herein. The lien may be enforced by
proceedings to foreclose, as in cases of mortgages or mechanics liens. Suit to
foreclose this lien must be commenced within three years after the date of
recording the deed. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the village
from bringing a civil action to collect the tax imposed by this chapter from
any person who has the ultimate liability for payment of the same, including
interest and penalties as hereinbelow provided. (Ord. 2119, 5-9-1983, eff. 7-1-

jurisdiction. (Ord. 2119, 5-9-1983, eff. 7-1-1983)

the rate of one percent per month commencing as of the first day following the
day when the tax became due. In addition, a penalty of ten percent of the tax
and interest due shall be assessed and collected against any person who shall
fail to pay the tax imposed by this chapter. (Ord. 2119, 5-9-1983, eff. 7-1-
1983; amd. Ord. 2195, 11-25-1985)
   N.   Proceeds Of Tax: All proceeds resulting from the imposition of the tax
under this chapter, including interest and penalties, shall be paid into the
treasury of the village, in order to pay costs involved in conducting zoning
inspections required under section
11-2-3 of this chapter; provided, however, that in the event the grantee or
purchaser is a participant fully qualified for benefits in the Illinois home
ownership made easy program ("H.O.M.E.") as provided in 65 Illinois Compiled

12-1-1: GENERAL PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   It is concluded that equity ownership of multiple-family dwellings is a
positive development for the village of River Forest (hereinafter "village")
and, within certain limits, such ownership should be encouraged.
   B.   Because of the unique nature of condominium ownership and the age of
the existing multiple-family dwelling stock in the village, it is further
concluded that the quality of housing and the rights of the condominium
purchaser should be protected to a greater extent than the protections provided
under existing laws.
   C.   The village has the authority to introduce regulation into the
condominium process.
   D.   Therefore, the purpose and intent of this chapter is to introduce
regulatory elements into the condominium process that are aimed at the
protection of the rights of the condominium purchasers and preserving and
improving the quality of housing in an effort to encourage orderly development
of the condominium concept in the village. Further, this chapter is intended to
facilitate code inspections by the village and, thus, to reduce the possibility
of a condominium containing material defects that would have an adverse effect
on the safety of its occupants or neighboring property, would increase on
street vehicle density or would place unexpected burdens on unit buyers. (Ord.

significant properties list. The owner receiving such notice shall be asked to
provide written acknowledgment of receipt of the intent to add the property to

request of: 1) a member of the commission after prior written notice to the
owner, or 2) the owner, under any of the following conditions:

certificate of appropriateness; 2) the expiration of a certificate of
demolition delay issued by the commission pursuant to subsection
13-1-8B2 of this chapter; or 3) the village board's reversal, on appeal, of the
commission's withholding of a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to
section

   B.   Exemption: Certificates of appropriateness shall not be required in
connection with compliance with an order or permit issued by the director of
public works, or his/her designee, to correct an immediate health or safety
problem; provided that such order expressly exempts the project from
certificate of appropriateness procedures and that such order or permit is made
subject to appropriate conditions to advance the purposes and goals of this
chapter.
   C.   Construction Standards:
      1.   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure or
site and its environment shall not be destroyed.

create an earlier appearance than the true age of the property are not
permitted.
      3.   Changes that may have taken place in the course of time and which
have acquired significance in their own right shall be recognized and respected
when dealing with a specific architectural period.
      4.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a structure, site or area shall be maintained.
      5.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be preferably repaired
rather than replaced. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material
should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities.
      6.   Repair or replacement of missing architectural features shall be
based on accurate duplications of features substantiated by historic, physical,
or pictorial evidence, or expert opinion.
      7.   Demolition of a local landmark shall not be permitted if a structure
is economically viable in its present condition or could be economically viable
after completion of commercially reasonable alterations, even if demolition
would permit a more profitable use of such site.
   D.   Design Standards: The height, adjacent open space, directional
expression, roof type, roof shape, architectural details, landscaping,
accessory structures and paving shall be consistent with the original
structure.
   E.   Procedures For Application For A Certificate: Any person or entity

forth in this section.
   G.   Economic Hardship: Any of the requirements of subsection C or D of this
section or subsection
13-1-8B2 of this chapter may be waived by the commission if the applicant shows
by clear and convincing evidence, and if the commission finds that any of the
following conditions exist:
      1.   The applicant's economic circumstances and the condition of the
subject property present a substantial hardship; or
      2.   Compliance with the requirement(s) is commercially unreasonable and
is not essential to achieve the purposes and goals set forth in section
 13-1-1 of this chapter.
The normal escalation of construction or land acquisition costs within the
village, per se, shall not be deemed a hardship or create commercially
unreasonable circumstances.
Personal financial information submitted for consideration pursuant to this
subsection shall be considered confidential and shall be disclosed at a public
hearing only to the extent necessary for a complete discussion of the issues.
Personal financial records, statements and tax returns shall be withheld from
public disclosure pursuant to section 7(1)(b) of the Illinois freedom of
information act, 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 140/1 et seq., as amended. (Ord.

13-1-7: REVIEW REQUIRED:
   A.   No repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, restoration, improvement or
signage involving more than twenty percent of any individual building facade of
any local landmark or significant property viewable from a street shall be
initiated, nor shall any building permit be issued for such work, until the
commission is notified of the proposed work, including a description of the
scope of work, and the conditions of subsection B of this section are met. Said
twenty percent shall be based upon the total footprint of any building facade
viewable from any portion of any street, or streets, adjacent to the
significant property as measured in linear feet. Work under this subsection
shall not be structured through the execution of multiple projects designed
with the apparent intention to avoid said twenty percent.
   B.   The commission shall have thirty days (seven days in the case of
windows) from the submission of a complete building permit application
(including architectural elevations with a description of materials together
with floor plans and site plans) to review the proposed work. After review, the
commission shall advise the applicant in writing of any recommendations it has
regarding the proposed work. The recommendations of the commission regarding
items covered by subsection A of this section as to significant properties
shall be advisory, shall not be binding upon the owner, and the proposed work
may proceed upon the occurrence of the earlier of either the expiration of the
thirty day period or receipt of the recommendations.
   C.   Upon request of an owner or the commission, the commission shall
schedule (and the owner shall attend) a meeting to consider and discuss
proposed work regarding items covered by subsection A of this section. Such
meetings shall not be subject to the requirements of section
13-1-8 of this chapter.
   D.   Demolition of a significant property as designated on the significant
properties survey shall be delayed for a period of not more than six (6) months
for significant properties that are not zoned in the PRI Public, Recreational
and Institutional District, and not more than twelve (12) months for
significant properties that are zoned in the PRI Public, Recreational and
Institutional District, following the commission's receipt of an application to
the village for a demolition permit and a public hearing regarding the issuance
of a certificate of appropriateness for such proposed demolition shall be held
pursuant to subsection
13-1-8B of this chapter. (Ord. 3589, 3-14-2016; amd. Ord. 3850, 12-13-2021)
13-1-8: HEARING PROCEDURES:
   A.   Public Hearing Not Required: Review of applications pursuant to section
13-1-7 of this chapter (other than for a proposed demolition) may be conducted
by the commission's architectural review subcommittee comprised of two members
and does not require a public hearing. Applications regarding proposed window
replacement shall be reviewed within seven days of commission's receipt of
proposed alterations, including photographs of current conditions and proposed
replacements; all other proposed alterations requiring review (except proposed
demolition) shall be reviewed by the commission at its next scheduled meeting
within thirty days following the commission's receipt of such completed
application and materials; provided, however, the review shall be conducted by
the architectural review subcommittee of the commission comprised of two
members if no commission meeting is scheduled to occur (or held) within such
thirty days. Any application denied without a public hearing shall be set for a
public hearing at the request of the applicant, which hearing shall proceed in
accordance with subsection B of this section.
   B.   Procedures: Public hearings regarding applications made pursuant to
sections
13-1-4 through
13-1-6 of this chapter shall be heard in accordance with the following
procedures:
      1.   Hearing Procedures: Within sixty days of the proper filing of a
complete application, or if requested by the applicant pursuant to subsection A
of this section, a public hearing shall be held by the commission. Notice of
such public hearing, summarizing the application, shall be published at least
fifteen days (and not more than thirty days) in advance of such public hearing
in a newspaper of general circulation in the village. Said notice shall be sent
via U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested by the applicant to all
owners of property within five hundred feet of the subject property at least
fifteen days in advance of such public hearing. An affidavit regarding proof of
mailing of the notice shall be provided by the applicant to the village prior
to the commencement of the public hearing. The village shall, at the
applicant's cost, post a sign in front of the subject building so as to be
readily visible from the frontage street at least fifteen days in advance of
such public hearing which shall contain the following information: a) in the
case of a proposal demolition requiring a certificate of appropriateness, as
described in subsection
13-1-6A of this chapter, capitalized words: "APPLICATION FOR DEMOLITION
PERMIT"; b) date, time and location of the hearing; c) property address; d)
name and address of the applicant, if not the owner of the property; e) name
and address of the owner of the property; and f) statement that all interested
persons will be heard, that written comments may be submitted in advance if
such interested person is unable to attend the hearing, as well as information
detailing where to obtain copies of the application and meeting agenda.
      2.   Findings By The Commission: The commission shall review all evidence
and (as applicable), either:
         a.   Determine if the application does or does not meet the
requirements of the definition of a "local landmark"; and the commission may
either grant or deny designation of local landmark status, as applicable. In
the event the subject property is listed on any national or state registry of
historic, landmark or architecturally significant properties, the commission
may consider such listing as prima facie evidence that the requirements for
designation as a local landmark have been met;
         b.   Determine if the proposed alteration or demolition of a local
landmark would be detrimental to the historical, architectural or cultural
resources of the village and the commission may either grant or deny a
certificate of appropriateness for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction,
restoration, demolition, improvement or signage, as applicable;
         c.   Issue a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of a
property listed on the village survey of architecturally or historically
significant properties; or
         d.   Withhold a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of a
property listed on the village survey of architecturally or historically
significant properties and, in such event, issue a certificate of demolition
delay for a period of not more than six (6) months for significant properties
that are not zoned in the PRI Public, Recreational and Institutional District,
and not more than twelve (12) months for significant properties that are zoned
in the PRI Public, Recreational and Institutional District, following the
filing of an application for a demolition permit with the village.
The applicant may present evidence of economic hardship during the public
hearing. In any of such events, the commission shall render a written decision
within fifteen days following the completion of a public hearing, and cause the
decision to be served upon the applicant.
      3.   Reconsideration: An applicant whose application is denied may
request reconsideration of the commission's withholding of a certificate of
appropriateness by filing a written request within thirty days after the
decision is rendered; provided, however, that the commission shall reconsider
an application only if substantial new evidence or information regarding the
subject property is provided, including a claim of economic hardship as set
forth in subsection 13-1-6G of this chapter, if not previously presented during
the public hearing. Such request for reconsideration shall be subject to the
provisions of subsection B1 of this section. Once an application has been
denied upon reconsideration, no further applications involving substantially
the same relief under this chapter for any structure, building, site, or area
may be filed for one year.
      4.   Meeting With Commission: The owner of a local landmark or
significant property as designated on the significant properties survey shall,
from and after the filing of an application for a certificate of
appropriateness for the proposed demolition of such local landmark or
significant property and until the earlier of: a) the expiration of such
demolition delay period (regarding a significant property); or b) the decision
of the village board (following an appeal) to reverse the commission's decision
to withhold a certificate of appropriateness for the proposed demolition, meet
with the commission in order to consider and discuss such proposal, as well as
explore potential preservation solutions including finding a prospective owner
to purchase, preserve, rehabilitate or restore the property (or such other
reasonable alternative to demolition). Such meetings shall be scheduled by the
commission and may be conducted by a two member subcommittee and do not require
a public hearing.
   C.   Successive Applications:
      1.   Second Applications Without New Grounds Barred: Whenever any
application filed pursuant to this chapter has been finally denied on its
merits, a second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or
not in the same form or on the same theory, shall not be brought unless in the
opinion of the village administrator and the village attorney there is
substantial new evidence available or a mistake of law or fact significantly
affected the prior denial.
      2.   New Grounds To Be Stated: Any such second application shall include
a detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration of such
application.
      3.   Summary Denial With Or Without Hearing: Any such second application
may be denied summarily, and without hearing, on a finding that no grounds
appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case where such application is set
for hearing, the applicant shall be required to establish grounds warranting
reconsideration of the merits of its application prior to being allowed to
offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such grounds are established, the
application may be summarily dismissed for such failure.
   D.   Burden Of Proof: The burden of proving each requirement for the relief
sought shall remain with the applicant throughout all proceedings. (Ord. 3589,
3-14-2016; amd. Ord. 3850, 12-13-2021)
