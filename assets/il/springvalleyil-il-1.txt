insurance coverage.
 
Retirees of the City, under age 65, shall be eligible for continued
participation in the City's health care plan, upon payment of all the costs

The City retains the right to change insurance plan(s), benefit(s), provider
(s), carrier(s), third party administrator(s), or to self-insure for the
provision of health, dental, and/or life insurance benefits, and the City
further reserves its right to institute, maintain and change cost containment,
benefits and other provisions of the plan(s), all as it may determine in its
sole discretion to be necessary or beneficial to the needs of the City. The
City will notify plan participants of any changes to the health insurance
program, and will bargain over the effects of any such changes upon request by

(B)   Vacation: Vacation leave shall be earned beginning with the first date of
employment as a bargaining unit member under the conditions hereinafter stated.
No employee shall be permitted to use vacation time for any period spent on

continuous employment.
 
Full-time Employees. Full-time employees are entitled to paid vacation leave
time according to the following schedule:
 
 
 
               Annual Hours

employee's authorized vacation leave will not be counted as a day of vacation.
 
Minimum Hours. Employees may use vacation leave in units of not less than one
(1) hour, subject to the approval of the Chief of Police or his designee.
 
Termination. Upon termination, an employee shall be compensated for all earned
but unused vacation leave at his/her final rate of pay, subject to the maximum
hours of accumulation authorized.
 
Vacation Buy-Back. Accrued vacation may be taken as time off or it may be
exchanged for cash benefit under the following conditions:
 
   1. Once per year, in June or December, eligible regular full-time employees
may request up to forty (40) hours of their current available accrued vacation
benefit time.
 
   2. The vacation buy-back requested must be approved by the Chief of Police
and submitted to the payroll clerk.
 
   3. Once the vacation buy-back is approved, it will be processed at the
employee's regular rate of pay. The employee will receive a separate check for
the vacation buy-back amount.
 
   4. All requests must be approved, refer only to vacation time, and be in
increments of complete hours. Only one request per calendar year may be
submitted.
 
Maximum Vacation Accrual. Employees who fail to utilize any of their vacation
time as time off, will forfeit any remaining portion in excess of the maximum
hours of accumulation each year.
 
Thereafter, the employee will not accrue any additional vacation hours until
such time as the accrued hours go below the maximum accrual limit.
 
The only exception to the forfeiture and non-accrual of additional vacation
hours may be if the City asks an employee to forego a scheduled vacation in
connection with unanticipated staffing shortages or if an employee faces an
unexpected hardship. In such cases, the employee should seek approval from the
Chief of Police to carry over the vacation balance. The employee must also
schedule and take, such time off within the one hundred eighty (180) days
following the anniversary date beyond which the carry forward occurs, or
forfeit such time.

provided to the City for actual cost and reimbursement will only be made for
actual money lost.

absences resulting from illness, injuries, accidents or other physical
incapacity, due to the officer’s own illness, or that of a spouse, civil union

chargeable to sick leave shall be charged in increments of not less than one
(1) hour.
 
Medical certification of the need for sick leave, in form and content
acceptable to the City, may be required whenever the Chief of Police has
reasonable suspicion that sick leave abuse may be occurring.
 
An employee, upon written request, may be granted a leave of absence without
pay or benefits for a period of up to six (6) months, subject to approval of
the Chief of Police or his designee.
 
Notification. Except in the case of an emergency, the police officer must
directly notify his or her supervisor prior to any absence from work. If a
police officer is unable to notify the supervisor, the officer shall notify the
on-duty officer-in-charge.

hours, day, or days as City Holidays to be paid as described in this contract
for City holidays.
 
The actual calendar day of the holiday will be observed by bargaining unit
members and will not be changed to a Friday or Monday.

is finally adjudged to be guilty of a criminal act; to the extent that any
criminal proceeding shall be pending at the time of indemnification or any
criminal proceeding shall thereafter be instituted, any indemnification paid or
promised shall be conditioned upon the termination of the criminal proceeding
without a finding of guilt;
   (B)   Any liability or judgment against an elected or appointed City
official, employee or authorized volunteer which is payable to the City itself
or where the City was injured and the elected or appointed City official,

for the current year. A certified copy of such ordinance shall be filed with
the county clerk, whose duty it shall be to ascertain the rate percent, which,
upon the total valuation of all the property subject to taxation within the
city, as the same is assessed and equalized for state and county purposes, will
produce a net amount not less than the amount so directed to be levied; and it
shall be the duty of the county clerk to extend such tax in a separate column
upon the books of the collector of the state and county taxes, within the city;
provided, the aggregate amount of taxes levied for any one year, exclusive of
the amount levied for the payment of bonded indebtedness or the interest

debt, appropriation or liability, the tax for such purpose shall be included in
the total amount assessed by the council, and certified to the county clerk as
aforesaid; but the council shall determine, in the ordinance making such
assessment, what proportion of such total amount shall be applicable to the
payment of the particular debt, appropriation or liability; and the treasurer
shall set apart such proportion of the tax collected and paid to him for the
payment of such particular debt, appropriation or liability, and shall not
disburse the same for any other purpose until such debt, appropriation or
liability shall have been discharged. (1972 Code)

Valley City Council will expect supervisory employees of any department seeking

employee to obtain bids or quotes from vendors for any item or supply unless an
emergency situation occurs or where in the opinion of the Spring Valley City

any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments based
upon any differences between such billings, and the taxable gross receipts.
   (G)   Credit For Overpayment: If it shall appear that an amount of tax has
been paid which was not due under the provisions of this section, whether as
the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be
credited against any tax due, or to become due, under this section from the

institutions not having business locations within the corporate limits of the
city of Spring Valley. Funds may be invested in financial institutions not
having facilities within the city of Spring Valley upon the recommendation of
the city treasurer and the concurrence of the Spring Valley city council. The

whether other health insurance is available or payable to the applicant, his/
her spouse and/or his/her qualifying dependent children. The affidavit must be
completed and returned to the City within thirty (30) calendar days of written
notice from the City. If the recipient does not complete and return the
affidavit within the time required, the City shall give the recipient an
additional written notice providing an additional fifteen (15) calendar days
for the recipient to complete and return the affidavit. Failure to return the
affidavit within the time required shall result in the recipient incurring
responsibility for reimbursing the City for premiums paid during the period the
affidavit is due and not filed.
   (C)   Disclosure Of Health Insurance Coverage: The applicant has an ongoing
obligation and shall update health insurance coverage information provided and
failure to do so may result in the denial of benefits and/or reimbursement to
the City for duplicate coverage. If duplicate coverage has been received by a
PSEBA beneficiary, further PSEBA benefits will be denied until the City has
been fully reimbursed by the PSEBA beneficiary for what it would have been
credited if it had known about other coverage.
   (D)   Reimbursement: Receipt of health insurance benefits from other sources
without notice to the City shall require the applicant to reimburse the City
for the value of those benefits.
   (E)   Medicare Eligibility: The applicant shall notify the City when the
applicant becomes Medicare eligible regardless of the status of the enrollment
period, so the City may assist with the transition to Medicare coverage and/or
adjust health insurance benefits or PSEBA benefits accordingly.

Notes
  1. This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of Human Rights
1 Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to Public Act
  100-0554, amended by Public Act 100-1066.
1-30-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the City of Spring Valley to prohibit
harassment of any person by any Municipal official, Municipal agent, Municipal
employee or Municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All
Municipal officials, Municipal agents, Municipal employees and Municipal
agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person,
regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. 1712, 12-18-2017; amd. Ord. 1733, 10-22-2018)
1-30-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   (A)   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in
the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct
of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment;
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      1.   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
      2.   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing
the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/Electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and
depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person."
(Ord. 1712, 12-18-2017; amd. Ord. 1733, 10-22-2018)
1-30-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      1.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      2.   Contact with Supervisory Personnel: At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality.
      The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment
must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no
witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible
officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
      3.   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within three hundred (300) days
of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with
the EEOC must also be filed within three hundred (300) days.
      4.   Allegations Of Sexual Harassment Made Against An Elected Official Of
The Governmental Unit By Another Elected Official Of A Governmental Unit: In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the human resources director,
the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 1712,
12-18-2017; amd. Ord. 1733, 10-22-2018; Ord. 1840, 5-16-2022)
1-30-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee's or official's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
or
      2.   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
      3.   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee's or official's involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act 1  provides whistleblower protection
from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee; or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act 2 , an employer may not retaliate
against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other
proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation, an employer may not
retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation 3 .
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act 4 , it is a civil rights
violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to retaliate
against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in
good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has
made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - either due within three hundred (300) days of the
alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 1712, 12-18-2017; amd. Ord. 1733, 10-22-2018; Ord. 1840, 5-16-2022)

1-30-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) per offense, applicable
discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and
penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or Federal law.
Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
State or Federal agency.
(Ord. 1712, 12-18-2017; amd. Ord. 1733, 10-22-2018)
1-30-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

The findings, decision, and order of the Administrative Hearing Officer shall
be subject to review in the Circuit Court of Bureau County. The provisions of
the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.) and the rules adopted
pursuant thereto shall apply to and govern every action for the judicial review
of the findings, decision, and order of an Administrative Hearing Officer under
this Chapter. (Ord. 1877, 8-7-2023)

accordance with applicable law.
   (B)   After the expiration of the period within which judicial review under
the Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of the
Code violation, the City may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court of
Bureau County for the purpose of obtaining a judgment on the findings,
decision, and order. Noting in this Section shall prevent the City from
consolidating multiple findings, decisions, and orders against a person in such
a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the City shall file a certified
copy of the findings, decision, and order, which shall be accompanied by a
certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings,
decision, and order was issued in accordance with this Chapter. Service of the
summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided for by Section

mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines, other
sanctions, and costs imposed by the findings, decision, and order does not
exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). If the court is satisfied
that the findings, decision, and order was entered in accordance with the
requirements of this Chapter and the applicable City ordinance(s) and that the
defendant had an opportunity for a hearing under this Chapter and for judicial
review as provided in this Chapter:
      1.   The court shall render judgment in favor of the City and against the
defendant for the amount indicated in the findings, decision, and order, plus
costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same
manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.
      2.   The court may also issue any other orders and injunctions that are
requested by the City to enforce the order of the Administrative Hearing
Officer to correct a Code violation.
   (C)   In place of a proceeding under subsection (B) of this Section, after
the expiration of the period in which judicial review under the Administrative
Review Law may be sought for a final determination of a code violation, unless
stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the findings, decision, and order
of the Administrative Hearing Officer may be enforced in the same manner as a
judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a judgment ordering
a defendant to correct a Code violation or imposing any fine or other sanction
as a result of a Code violation, any expenses incurred by the City to enforce
the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, and
costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are fixed by a
court of competent jurisdiction or an Administrative Hearing Officer, shall be
a debt due and owing to the City and may be collected in accordance with
applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by an Administrative Hearing
Officer pursuant to this subsection (C), the City shall provide notice to the
defendant that states that the defendant shall appear at a hearing before the
Administrative Hearing Officer to determine whether the defendant has failed to
comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date for such a hearing,
which shall not be less than seven (7) days from the date the notice is served.
If the notice is served by mail, the seven (7) day period shall begin to run on
the date that the notice was deposited in the mail.
Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Code of Civil
Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed on the
real estate or personal estate, or both, of the defendant in the amount of any
debt due and owing the City under this Section. The lien may be enforced in the
same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
An Administrative Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by default
and set a new hearing date, upon a petition filed within twenty one (21) days
after the issuance of the order of default, if the Administrative Hearing
Officer determines that the petitioner's failure to appear at the initial
hearing was for good cause or at any time if the petitioner establishes that
the City did not provide proper service of process. If any judgment is set
aside pursuant to this Subsection (C), the Administrative Hearing Officer shall
have the authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been
recorded for any debt due and owing the City as a result of the vacated
judgment. (Ord. 1877, 8-7-2023)

thereby causing a blighting influence on a neighborhood. (Ord. 657, 9-8-1987)
3-8-3: DECIDING UPON QUESTIONS ARISING UNDER ORDINANCE NOTICE TO REMEDY UNSAFE
CONDITION OF BUILDINGS; FAILURE TO OBEY NOTICE:
The superintendent of public works or his designee shall have full power to

The superintendent of public works or his designee is hereby authorized to
demolish or repair or cause the demolition or repair of dangerous buildings or
uncompleted buildings or abandoned buildings within the territorial limits of
the city. (Ord. 657, 9-8-1987)
3-8-4: NOTICE OF UNSAFE CONDITION OF BUILDINGS; MEANS OF SERVICE:
When a building or structure within the city is found to be a "dangerous
building" or contains an unsafe condition, an inspector for the superintendent
of public works shall issue and serve a notice thereof upon all owners of
record or persons having an interest therein as shown by documents recorded in
the office of the Bureau County recorder of deeds and upon persons in apparent
possession of the premises.
The notice shall briefly and concisely specify the conditions and factors of
the building or structure which render it dangerous or unsafe. The notice shall
further specify that the owners make the building safe (by complete elimination
of any unsafe conditions) or commence demolition at owner's costs within
fifteen (15) days of said notice. The notice shall further specify that: a)
demolition shall commence no later than fifteen (15) days of said notice, and
b) a date for completion of demolition. The date for completion shall be
reasonably set in light of the nature of the building, weather conditions, and
other related factors. The fifteen (15) day time period shall commence upon
receipt of the notice.
The notice authorized by this section shall be served by either personal
service or by certified mail with return receipt. Personal service may be made
by either an inspector designated by the superintendent of public works or a
police officer of the city.
Where, upon diligent search, the identity or whereabouts of the owner or owners
of any such building, including the lienholders of record is not ascertainable,
notice mailed to the person or persons in whose name such real estate was last
assessed for general real estate taxes is sufficient notice under this section.
In the event the owner fails to comply with any time period set forth in the
notice, the corporation counsel is authorized to commence a civil action in the
circuit court of Bureau County seeking a court order authorizing demolition or
repair of the building or structure subject to the notice provided by this
section and to create the lien described in section
3-8-7 of this chapter. It shall not be a defense to this cause of action that
the building is boarded up or otherwise enclosed. It further shall not be
defense that the building is put in a safe condition during the pendency of the
civil action.
Joined as defendants in said cause shall be the owner of record and other
parties having an interest in the property as shown by documents recorded in
the office of the Bureau County recorder of deeds on the date of the filing of
the complaint for demolition. (Ord. 657, 9-8-1987)
3-8-5: LIS PENDENS:
Upon the commencement of the civil action set forth in section
3-8-4 of this chapter, a lis pendens designating the property upon which the
subject building is located shall be filed with the recorder of deeds. Failure
to file or the improper filing of the lis pendens does not, however, affect the
civil action for demolition. Any person obtaining or recording in said office
an interest in the property after such filing may become party to the civil
action only if he intervenes by order of the court. (Ord. 657, 9-8-1987)
3-8-6: PLACARDING OF BUILDING OR STRUCTURE:
Whenever any dwelling or building has been designated a "dangerous building" or
contains unsafe conditions, an inspector designated by the superintendent of
public works shall placard the building indicating that the condition is
dangerous and unsafe. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, cause to
remove or cover up in any way any placard designating a building structure a
"dangerous building". Anyone found guilty of violating this section shall be
punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense. (Ord. 657, 9-8-1987)
3-8-7: DEMOLITION LIEN, PERSONAL JUDGMENT:
The cost of demolition, repair, engineering and related expenses, and legal
proceedings incurred by the city in enforcing the provisions of this chapter
shall be recoverable from the owner or owners of the real estate and is a lien
thereon, which lien shall be superior to all prior existing liens and
encumbrances, except taxes, provided, however, that within sixty (60) days
after completion of the demolition or repair, the corporation counsel shall
file a notice of lien for the cost and expense incurred by the city, in the
office of the recorder of deeds of Bureau County. Upon payment of said cost of
demolition by the owner or any person who has an interest in the property, the
lien shall be released by the corporation counsel.
The lien may be enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in case of mortgages or
mechanics' liens. Suit to foreclose this lien shall be commenced by the
corporation counsel within three (3) years after the date of filing of notice
of lien.
If payment of the city's cost of demolition is not paid to the city within
fifteen (15) days of the filing of the notice of lien, the corporation counsel
may commence proceedings in the circuit court seeking a personal judgment from
the owner of the subject property at the time the complaint for demolition was
filed with the circuit clerk in the amount of said costs. The action authorized
by this paragraph shall be in addition, and without waiver of, any other
remedies. (Ord. 657, 9-8-1987)
3-8-8: NUISANCE, PENALTY:
Any unsafe, dilapidated and abandoned building, house, barn or other structure
situated within the limits of the city is, and the same is hereby declared to
be, a nuisance.
Any person maintaining a nuisance shall be punished by a fine of not less than
twenty five dollars ($25.00) and not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
for each offense, and each and every day that such nuisance remains unabated
shall constitute a new and separate offense. (Ord. 657, 9-8-1987)

Valley Zoning Board of Appeals. The Spring Valley Zoning Board of Appeals
considering any such petition may recommend to the Spring Valley City Council
immediate revocation of the license, continuance of the suspension to a
definite compliance date with revocation being the penalty for noncompliance,
or dismissal of the charges and reinstatement of the license. The Spring Valley

building determined to be a vacant building, a copy of the registration form
the owner is required to file pursuant to this chapter, and a notice of the
owner's right to appeal the building inspector's determination. (Ord. 1648, 11-
7-2016)
3-12-5: APPEAL OF DETERMINATION:
   (A)   An owner of a building determined by the building inspector to be a
vacant building as provided for in this chapter may appeal that determination
to the building inspector. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the building inspector within fifteen (15) days of the date of mailing of
the notice of determination. The filing of an appeal stays the owner's
obligation to register his building as required by this chapter. The appeal
shall contain a complete statement of the reasons the owner disputes the
building inspector's determination, shall set forth specific facts in support
thereof, and shall include all evidence the owner relies upon to support the
appeal. The building inspector shall decide the appeal on the basis of facts
presented by the owner in his or her written appeal and the building
inspector's written determination.
      1.   The burden is upon the owner to present sufficient evidence to
persuade the building inspector that had the evidence been known to the
building inspector at the time the building inspector made the determination,
the building inspector would more likely than not have determined that the
subject building was not a "vacant building" within the meaning of this
chapter.
      2.   The building inspector shall send written notice of his decision to
the owner within ten (10) days of his or her receipt of the appeal. The
building inspector may, but is not required to, seek additional information
from the owner. The building inspector may, upon written notice thereof to the
owner, take no more than ten (10) additional days, to decide the appeal if he
or she determines that such additional time is required for consideration of
the appeal.
      3.   An owner who wishes to challenge applicability of this chapter to
his/her building without the building inspector's determination having been
made, shall set forth specific facts to support nonapplicability in a writing
to the building inspector. In the event the building inspector determines that
the subject building is a "vacant building", the owner shall have the right to
appeal the building inspector's determination to the building inspector as
provided for herein. (Ord. 1648, 11-7-2016)
3-12-6: OBLIGATION TO REGISTER:
   (A)   The owner of a building who knows, or from all the facts and
circumstances should know, that his or her building is or has become a "vacant
building" within the meaning of this chapter after the effective date of this
chapter or the owner of a building which the building inspector determines at
any time to be a "vacant building", or the owner of a building whose appeal
from the building inspector's determination has been denied by the building
inspector shall take the actions provided for in this section within fifteen
(15) days after either the date of the building inspector's notice of
determination or occurrence of the facts which would cause a reasonable person
to believe that the building was a "vacant building", or denial of the appeal,
whichever is applicable. Registration does not exonerate the owner from
compliance with all applicable codes and ordinances, including this chapter,
nor does it preclude any of the actions the City of Spring Valley is authorized
to take pursuant to this chapter or other Spring Valley statutes.
      1.   Registration Requirements:
         (a)   Register the building with the building inspector, on a form
provided by the building inspector and pay the two hundred dollar ($200.00)

case name and number of any litigation pending concerning or affecting the
building, including bankruptcy cases; and the name, street address, and
telephone number of all persons with any legal interest in the building or the
premises. The form shall require the owner to identify a natural person twenty
one (21) years of age or older who maintains a permanent address in Bureau
County, Illinois or LaSalle County, Illinois, to accept service on behalf of
the owner with respect to any notices the building inspector sends pursuant to
this chapter or service of process in any proceeding commenced to enforce any
provision of this chapter, and file with the building inspector on the
registration form, the name, address, telephone number, of said person. A
street address is required. A post office box is not an acceptable address.
         (b)   Renew the vacant building registration each year on the
anniversary date of the first filing for the time the building remains vacant
and pay the required two hundred dollar ($200.00) annual fee; and
         (c)   File an amended registration within fifteen (15) days of any
change in the information contained in the annual registration. A new
registration is required for any change in ownership whatsoever.
      2.   Notice; Inspection: The form shall require the owner to indicate his
or her "acceptance of notice by posting" consenting to service of notices sent
or required to be sent, pursuant to this chapter, by posting on the building if
the owner fails to renew the registration if required, or maintain as current
with the building inspector the information required regarding the person
designated to accept notice and service of process.
The owner shall allow for a code compliance inspection of the interior of the
vacant building and shall pay the five hundred dollar ($500.00) fee therefor
within thirty (30) days of the inspection; provided, however, that for all
vacant buildings existing upon the date of the adoption of this chapter the
owner shall pay a one hundred fifty dollar ($150.00) inspection fee to the City
of Spring Valley within thirty (30) days of inspection. Such inspection will
determine the extent of compliance with City of Spring Valley Property,
Building Codes, Health, Fire, Water and Sewer Codes. The City of Spring Valley

      3.   Insurance: Obtain liability insurance and maintain such insurance
for as long as the building is vacant, and file evidence of such insurance with
the building inspector, as follows: five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00)
for a vacant residential building of one to three (3) units; seven hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($750,000.00) for a vacant residential building of four
(4) to eleven (11) units; one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for a vacant
residential building of twelve (12) to forty eight (48) units; two million
dollars ($2,000,000.00) for a vacant residential building of more than forty
eight (48) units; and one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for a vacant
manufacturing, industrial, storage, or nonresidential commercial building.
      4.   Vacant Building Plan: At the time a building is registered as
required herein, the owner shall submit a vacant building plan. The building
inspector may prescribe a form for the plan. If the owner fails to submit the
plan as provided for by this chapter, the building inspector may determine the
plan. The plan shall contain the following as a minimum:
         (a)   A plan of action to repair any doors, windows, or other openings
which are boarded up or otherwise secured by any means other than conventional
methods used in the design of the building or permitted for new construction or
similar type. The proposed repair shall result in openings being secured by
conventional methods used in the design of the building or by methods permitted
for new construction or similar type with board removed. Boarding shall be
accomplished with materials and methods described by the building inspector.
The owner shall maintain the building in an enclosed and secure state until the
building is reoccupied or made available for immediate occupancy. If the owner
demonstrates that securing of the building will provide adequate protection to
the public, the building inspector may waive the requirement of an enclosure.
         (b)   For buildings and premises thereof which are determined by the
building inspector as being or constituting a public nuisance, as defined in
section
3-12-3 of this chapter, then the vacant building plan shall contain a plan of
action to remedy such public nuisance(s).
         (c)   A time schedule identifying a date of commencement of repair and
date of completion of repair for each improperly secured opening and nuisance
identified by the building inspector.
         (d)   When the owner proposes to demolish the vacant building, then
the owner shall submit a plan and time schedule for such demolition.
         (e)   A plan of action to maintain the building and premises thereof
in conformance with this chapter.

building will be habitable and occupied or offered for occupancy or sale. The
time schedule shall include date(s) of commencement and completion of all
actions required to achieve habitability. No plan which provides for compliance
with this chapter or, which will not, as determined by the building inspector,
achieve such compliance, within six (6) months, in the case of a vacant boarded
building, and two (2) years, in the case of a vacant, unboarded, and code
compliant building will be approved.
         (g)   All premises upon which unoccupied or vacant buildings are
located and the exteriors shall at all times be maintained in compliance with
this Code.
         (h)   Exterior lighting according to standards established by the
building inspector and available from the building inspector.

provide bonded, licensed, and insured security guard service at the building
between the hours of three o'clock (3:00) P.M. and eight o'clock (8:00) A.M.
Such service to remain in place until the building inspector gives written
notice that the service is no longer required. Such service shall be required
when the building inspector makes a written determination that the vacant
building is a fire hazard, is otherwise dangerous to human life or the public
welfare, involves illegal or improper use, occupancy, or maintenance, under
such conditions that boarding and securing the building are insufficient to
prevent the actual or threatened harm.
      6.   Signage: Affixed to any building which is boarded, no smaller than
two feet by two feet (2' x 2') and compliance with the City of Spring Valley's
sign regulations and providing the following information: The name, address,
and telephone number of the owner, and in addition, for buildings which are the
subject of a foreclosure action, the name, address, and telephone number of the
plaintiff and the plaintiff's attorney, if any, in the foreclosure action. The
sign must be placed so that its message is legible from the public way.
      7.   Approval Of Plan:
         (a)   Review Building Plan: The building inspector shall review the
proposed vacant building plan in accordance with the standards below. The
building inspector shall send notice to the owner of the vacant building of his
determination.
         (b)   Standards For Plan Approval: In considering the appropriateness
of a vacant building plan, the building inspector shall include the following
in his or her consideration and shall make written findings as to each:
            (1)   The purposes of this chapter and intent of the City of Spring
Valley City Council to minimize the time a building is boarded or otherwise
vacant.
            (2)   The effect of the building and the proposed plan on adjoining
property.
            (3)   The length of time the building has been vacant.
            (4)   The presence of any public nuisances on the property.

prevent or ameliorate the condition it is designed to address.

shall, upon notice to the vacant building owner, have the right to modify the
vacant building plan by modifying the dates of performance, the proposed
methods of action, or by imposing additional requirements consistent with this
chapter he or she deems necessary to protect the public health, safety, or
welfare.
      9.   Failure To Comply With Plan: Failure to have an approved plan within
thirty (30) days of filing the registration form or failure to comply with the
approved plan shall constitute a violation of this chapter subjecting the owner
of the building to penalties as provided in this chapter and to any remedies
the City of Spring Valley may avail itself of as provided for herein or in
other Spring Valley ordinances, including, but not limited to, an action to
compel correction of property maintenance violations. (Ord. 1648, 11-7-2016)

3-12-9: BOARDING OF BUILDINGS:
It is the policy of the City of Spring Valley that boarding is a temporary
solution to prevent unauthorized entry into a vacant building and that boarded
buildings are a public nuisance. A vacant building may not remain boarded
longer than six (6) months unless an extension of that time is part of a plan
approved by the building inspector. A vacant building which is unboarded and
code compliant and for which boarding is determined by the building inspector
on the basis of police reports, citizen complaints, and other information of
other type considered reliable by reasonable persons, to not require boarding
to prevent unauthorized entry may not remain vacant for more than two (2) years
without an approved plan for occupancy, sale, demolition, or other disposition
of the building. (Ord. 1648, 11-7-2016)

building fails or refuses to consent to free access and entry to the vacant
building under his or her control for any inspection pursuant to this chapter,

for a search warrant or other appropriate court order authorizing such
inspections. However, except in emergency situations, no application for such
search warrant shall be made without first making a reasonable effort to secure
access and entry to the vacant building through the owner or the owner's
property agent identified by the owner of the vacant building. (Ord. 1663, 2-
13-2017)
3-12-11: ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:

Spring Valley. Such other remedies include, but are not limited to, injunctive
relief, application to a court of competent jurisdiction for a receiver,
demolition, or condemnation, contracting for the repair or purchase of the
premises, or foreclosure of any lien the City of Spring Valley may have
thereon.
   (B)   A separate and distinct offense shall be committed each day on which
such person or persons shall violate the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Nothing herein contained shall prohibit the City of Spring Valley from
immediately condemning as provided for in this Code a building or taking other
immediate action upon a determination that the building is a public nuisance or
poses an imminent danger to the occupants of the building, or the public
health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 1663, 2-13-2017)

7-1-28: WASTEWATER SERVICE SURCHARGE AND COMPUTATION OF BASIC CHARGE:
The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance plus replacement, applicable surcharges, and local
capital cost charge composed of a debt service charge and a capital improvement
charge.
   (A)   Basis For Wastewater Service Charges: The debt service charge is
computed by apportioning the annual debt service on a cost per one thousand
(1,000) gallon basis.
The capital improvement charge is levied on all users to provide for capital
improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the sewage treatment works. The
capital improvement is computed by apportioning the annual amount to be accrued
as a cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons.
The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters
for wastes having the following normal domestic concentrations:
      1.   A five (5) day twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD of 200 mg/l).
      2.   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred fifty milligrams per
liter (250 mg/l).
It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall
be computed as follows:
      1.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated.
      2.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
      3.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and replacement
costs to each user class by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
      4.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and replacement
(OM&R) costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended solids and
BOD.
      5.   Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage
strength.
      6.   Compute surcharge costs per pound per one thousand (1,000) gallons
in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal domestic
concentrations of BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge will be based
on water usage as recorded by water meters for all wastes which exceed the two
hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) and two hundred fifty milligrams per
liter (250 mg/l) concentration for BOD and SS respectively. Subsection (C) of
this section specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed, not less often
than annually, by certified public accountants for the city in their annual
audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to
reflect a change in local capital costs or a change in operation and
maintenance costs including replacement costs.
The users of wastewater treatment services will be notified annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user
charges which are attributable to the wastewater treatment operation,
maintenance and replacement.
   (B)   Surcharge Rate: The rates of surcharges for BOD5 and SS shall be as
follows:
 
Per pound of BOD $0.14
Per pound of SS  0.12
 
   (C)   Computation Of Surcharge: The concentration of wastes used for
computing surcharges shall be established by waste sampling. Waste sampling
shall be performed as often as may be deemed necessary by the city and shall be
binding as a basis for surcharges.
   (D)   Computation Of Wastewater Service Charge: The wastewater service
charge shall be computed by the following formula:
   CW = CC + CD + CM + (Vu - X) CU + CS
Where:   
 CW   = Amount of waste service charge ($) per billing period.
 CD   = Debt service charge.
 CC   = Capital improvement charge.
 CM   = Minimum charge for operation, maintenance and replacement.
 Vu   = Wastewater volume for the billing period.
 X    = Allowable consumption in gallons for the minimum charge.
 CU   = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement.
 CS   = Amount of surcharge.

be made of all transactions relative to the sewerage system, and at regular
annual intervals he shall cause to be made an audit by an independent auditing
concern of the books to show the receipts and disbursements of the sewerage
system.
In addition to the customary operating statements, the annual audit report
shall also reflect the revenues and operating expenses of the wastewater
facilities, including a replacement cost, to indicate that sewer service
charges under the waste cost recovery system, and capital amounts required to
be recovered under the industrial cost recovery system do in fact meet these
regulations. In this regard, the financial information to be shown in the audit
report shall include the following:
   (A)   Flow data showing total gallons received at the wastewater plant for
the current fiscal year.
   (B)   Billing data to show total number of gallons billed per fiscal year.

be allowed if it can be demonstrated that the downstream sewerage facilities,
including sewers, pump station and wastewater treatment facilities, have
sufficient reserve capacity to adequately and efficiently handle the additional
anticipated waste load.
All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection of the
building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city
from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation of the building sewer.
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building;
except, where one building stands at the rear of another or an interior lot and
no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building
through the adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from
the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer.

Manual Of Practice No. 9" and "Standard Specifications For Water And Sewer Main
Construction In Illinois" shall apply.)
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an
elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building
drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage
carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and
discharged to the building sewer.
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains,
areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building
sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a
public sanitary sewer. Except as hereinafter provided, all persons having
existing connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway
drains or building drains, which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to
a public sanitary sewer or combined sewer as defined by this chapter, shall
disconnect same prior to January 1, 1983. (Ord. 685, 2-6-1989)

within ninety (90) days after date of official notice to do so if storm sewer
becomes available, provided that said storm sewer is within one hundred feet
(100') of the property line.
New construction tributary to the combined sewer system shall be designed to
minimize and/or delay inflow contribution to the combined sewer system. (Ord.
1075, 8-5-2002)
Where the owner or his agent can show that compliance with the foregoing
provisions would cause undue and unnecessary hardship of strictly adhering to,
and where because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site or
surrounding conditions, the city council may approve a variance upon petition
therefor, and upon the recommendations of the water and sewer committee of the
council after inspection of the site by said committee.
The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the
requirements of the building and plumbing code, or other applicable rules and
regulations of the city, or the procedures set forth in appropriate
specifications of the American Society Of Testing Materials, "Water Pollution
Control Federation Manual Of Practice No. 9", and "Standard Specifications For
Water And Sewer Main Construction In Illinois". All such connections shall be
made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and
materials must be approved by the superintendent before installation.
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the superintendent
when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the superintendent
or his representative.
All excavations for the building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded
with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the
work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. (Ord. 685, 2-6-
1989)

explosive liquid, solid or gas.
   (B)   Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids or
gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a
hazard to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in
the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant, including, but not limited
to, cyanides in excess of two milligrams per liter (2 mg/l) as CN in the wastes
as discharged to the public sewer.
   (C)   Any wastes or waters having a pH lower than 5.5 or having any other
corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment
and personnel of the sewage works.
   (D)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of

No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described
substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of
the superintendent that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage
treatment process or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream,
or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance.
In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
superintendent, in consultation with the city engineer, superintendent of
sewage treatment plant, and the county and state regulating agency, will give
consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation
to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers,
nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant,
degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors. The substances prohibited are:
      1.   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than one hundred
fifty degrees Fahrenheit (150°F).
      2.   Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred milligrams per liter (100 mg/l) or

sample tested shall not release more than two milligrams per liter (2 mg/l) of
cyanide when tested at a pH of 4.5 and at a temperature of one hundred fifty
degrees Fahrenheit (150°F) for a period of thirty (30) minutes. Such discharges
shall be permitted only when the agency has determined that no violation of the
effluent criteria of 0.025 milligram per liter concentration (alone or in
combination with other sources) will result from such discharge.
   (G)   Any concentration of certain substances in the waste discharged to the
city sewers in excess of limits and standards as may be promulgated by the
United States environmental protection agency from time to time.
   (H)   Any substance listed in subsection (F) of this section or any other

treatment plant effluent exceeding the current maximum limits established by
the regulatory agencies for such plant effluent flows.
      3.   Any concentrations of toxic or objectionable substances in plant
effluent flows which will result in concentrations of such substances in the
receiving waters which will exceed the regulatory agency's maximum allowable
limits for these substances in the receiving waters.
   (I)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the city as necessary after treatment of the composite sewage,
to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other public agencies of
jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters.
   (J)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life concentration as
may exceed limits established by the superintendent in compliance with
applicable state or federal regulations.
   (K)   Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.

      1.   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not
limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries and lime residues) or of dissolved
solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate).
      2.   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions).
      3.   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.
      4.   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined in section
7-2-1 of this chapter.
   (M)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
All such persons not now in compliance with the aforesaid provisions of this
section shall be required to comply with same prior to January 1, 1972.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the
public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in this section, and/or which are in violation of
the standards for pretreatment provided in 40 CFR 403, June 26, 1978, and any
amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the superintendent may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the superintendent may:
      1.   Reject the wastes;
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      4.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under provisions of this
chapter.
If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the superintendent, and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances and laws of the city.
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other
harmful ingredients; except, that such interceptors shall not be required for
private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type
and capacity approved by the superintendent, and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at his expense.
When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner, at his expense,
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial
wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analysis of water and
wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special conditions
for discharge established by the city or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge.
The number, type and frequency of laboratory analysis to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the city, but no less than once per year the
industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater
discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state, and local
standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and
laboratory analysis to the city at such times and in such a manner as
prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements,
analyses and reporting required by the city. At such times as deemed necessary
the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an
outside laboratory service.
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods For The Examination Of
Water And Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24 hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from grab
samples.)
No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by
the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern.
(Ord. 685, 2-6-1989)
7-2-5: PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE:
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, wilfully or negligently break,

and deliver to the superintendent in written form, a narrative report
describing the processes undertaken upon said property, including, but not
limited to, metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper or other
industries which may have a direct bearing on the kind, type, make up, and
source of discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste
treatment.
While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in this
section, the superintendent or duly authorized employees of the city shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company
and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city
employees and the city shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to
its property by city employees, and against liability claims and demands for
personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and growing out
of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by
negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions as required in
section
7-2-4 of this chapter.
The superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing
proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private
properties through which the city holds a duly negotiated easement for the

It is accepted practice for those political entities using the permit system to
call for two (2) classes of permits:
   (A)   For residential and commercial building sewers, and
   (B)   For industrial sewer connections. (1972 Code)
7-2-9: INCORPORATION OF NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
Upon the promulgation of the national categorical pretreatment standard for a
particular industrial user, the said standard, if more stringent than the
limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that category, shall,
when effective, immediately supersede the limitations and conditions imposed
under this chapter and said standards shall be complied with by all industrial
users subject to each of said national categorical pretreatment standards.
(Ord., 6-17-1985)
7-2-10: EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE:
No user shall increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to
dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
national categorical pretreatment standards (NCPS) when effective, or in any
other pollutant specific limitations developed by the POTW. (Ord., 6-17-1985)
7-2-11: SPILL CONTAINMENT:
   (A)   Each industrial user having the ability to cause interference with the
POTW treatment plant or to violate the regulatory provisions of this chapter
shall provide protection from accidental discharge to the POTW or prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the owner's or user's own cost and expense.
   (B)   All industrial users whose wastewater includes or could include
compatible or incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause
interference with the POTW must have detailed plans on file at the POTW showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide protection from accidental
discharge. All industrial users shall complete construction of said facilities
by June 30, 1985. No industrial user who begins contributing to or could
contribute such pollutants to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter
shall be permitted to introduce such pollutants into the POTW until accidental
discharge facilities and procedures, as appropriate, have been approved by the
POTW and installed by the industrial user. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
   (C)   In the case of an accidental or deliberate discharge of compatible or
incompatible pollutants which may cause interference at the POTW or will pass
through the POTW or violate requirements of this chapter, it shall be the
responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the
POTW of the incident. The notification shall include name of caller, location
and time of discharge, type of wastewater, concentration and volume.
   (D)   Within fifteen (15) days following such an accidental or deliberate
discharge the industrial user shall submit to the POTW a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Follow up reports may be
required by the POTW as needed. Such report, or reports, shall not relieve the
industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such report relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or
otherwise.
Failure to report accidental or deliberate discharges will be considered a
violation of this chapter and the discharger will be subject to any fines,
civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or
otherwise.
   (E)   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (F)   A notice in English and the language of common use shall be
permanently posted in the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental or illegal
discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who are in a position to
cause, discover, or observe such discharge are advised of the emergency
notification procedures. (Ord., 6-17-1985)
7-2-12: COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES:
   (A)   Compliance Meeting: Should a violation of this chapter by an
industrial user occur, whether or not a significant user, the POTW shall notify
the offending user, in writing, as to the particulars of such violation or
violations and set a time and place for a meeting to be attended by
representatives of the POTW and the industrial user. The purpose of such a
meeting shall be to establish such procedures, investigations, studies and
compliance measures as the POTW deems necessary and desirable to control and
prevent violations of this chapter. The industrial user shall cooperate fully
with the POTW in making such investigations and studies.
   (B)   Compliance Requirements:
      1.   Following the completion of any procedures, investigations or
studies as described in subsection (A) of this section, the POTW may:
         (a)   Require compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements;
         (b)   Control the contribution to the POTW to ensure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements;
         (c)   Require: 1) the development of a compliance schedule for the
installation of technology required to meet applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements and 2) the submission of all notices and self-monitoring
reports as are necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users
with pretreatment standards and requirements, including, but not limited to,
the reports required by 40 CFR section 403.12.
      2.   If the POTW has sufficient information at the time of the compliance
meeting to determine necessary and desirable compliance measures, it may, at
the time of the compliance meeting, issue a directive requiring the industrial
user to take such action, including pretreatment, without further investigation
or study.
      3.   Failure to comply with said directive shall be deemed a violation of
the chapter and may be grounds for such actions as may be authorized for
violation of this chapter. (Ord., 6-17-1985)
7-2-13: IMMEDIATE DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE:
   (A)   Conditions For Immediate Disconnection Of Service: Any industrial user
is subject to immediate disconnection of service under either of the following
conditions:
      1.   Whenever immediate disconnection is required to halt or prevent any
discharge of pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appears to the
superintendent to present an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons; or
      2.   Whenever the industrial user's IEPA wastewater discharge permit is
revoked.
   (B)   Procedures For Immediate Disconnection:
      1.   Notwithstanding section
7-2-12 of this chapter, the superintendent shall have the authority, after
informal notice to the industrial user, to immediately and effectively halt or
prevent any discharge of pollutants to the POTW that reasonably appears to
present an imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. When the
superintendent determines that such an emergency situation exists, he shall
issue a verbal order (followed immediately by a written order) to the
industrial user stating the problem and requiring immediate cessation of the
discharge. The superintendent's actions may include disconnection of wastewater
collection service. The superintendent shall obtain the concurrence of the POTW
attorney before initiating action. Methods of informal notice shall include,
but not be limited to, any of the following: personal conversation between the
industrial user and POTW employees, telephone calls, letters, hand delivered
messages or notices posted at the industrial user's premises or point of
discharge. (Ord., 6-17-1985)
7-2-14: ELIMINATION OF DISCHARGE/REINSTATEMENT:
Any industrial user notified of a disconnection of wastewater treatment service
under section
7-2-13 of this chapter and/or revocation of its IEPA wastewater discharge
permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a
failure of the industrial user to comply voluntarily with the disconnection or
revocation order, the POTW shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate blockage or severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW system or danger to any person. If the superintendent
exercises his authority under section
7-2-13 of this chapter, the superintendent shall reinstate the wastewater
treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge.
(Ord., 6-17-1985)
7-2-15: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
   (A)   The POTW may institute a civil action for an injunction to restrain
violations of this chapter.
   (B)   The POTW may, upon discovering an ongoing or potential discharge or
pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appears to present an imminent danger
to the health or welfare of persons, seek and obtain from the circuit court of
Bureau County a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to halt
or prohibit such discharge. Prior to the filing of such petition, the
discharger shall be given informal notice of the POTW intention to file such
action. Methods of informal notice shall include, but not be limited to, any of
the following: personal conversation between discharger and the POTW employees,
telephone calls, letters, hand delivered message or notices posted at the
discharger's premises or point of discharge. Personal contact between the POTW
personnel and the discharger shall be attempted, but shall not be condition
precedent to POTW petitioning for and obtaining a temporary restraining order.
(Ord., 6-17-1985)
7-2-16: ADDITIONAL REMEDIES:
   (A)   In addition to remedies available to the POTW set forth elsewhere in
this chapter, if the POTW is fined by the state of Illinois or USEPA for
violation of the POTW NPDES permit or violation of water quality standards as
the result of discharge of pollutants, then the fine, including all the POTW
legal, sampling, analytical testing costs and any other related costs shall be
charged to the responsible industrial user. Such charge shall be in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies the POTW may have under this
chapter, statutes, regulations, at law or in equity.
   (B)   If the discharge from any industrial user causes a deposit,
obstruction or damage to any of the POTW wastewater facility, the POTW shall
cause the deposit or obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to
be promptly repaired. The cost for such work, including materials, labor, and
supervision, shall be borne by the person or industrial user causing such
deposit, obstruction or damage.
   (C)   The remedies provided in this chapter shall not be exclusive and the
POTW may seek whatever other remedies are authorized by statute, at law or in
equity against any person or industrial user violating the provisions of this
chapter.
   (D)   In addition to any fine levied under section
7-2-7 of this chapter, the POTW may, where the circumstances of the particular
case so dictate, seek injunctive relief to prohibit the user from discharging
into the sanitary sewer system, or to provide such other affirmative relief as
may be appropriate. (Ord., 6-17-1985)
7-2-17: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
   (A)   Information and data relating to an industrial user obtained from
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs
and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests,
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the POTW, that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, and until such time
as the POTW determines that the requested information is not entitled to
confidential treatment, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental
agencies for uses related to this chapter, the national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) permit, and for use by the state or state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person or industrial
user furnishing the report.
   (C)   Information and data provided to the POTW which is effluent data shall
be available to the public without restriction.

8-7A-2: ELIGIBLE SIDEWALKS:
The aldermen of the Spring Valley city council shall survey the sidewalks in
their ward and shall designate sidewalks within each ward which are deemed to
be either unsafe or eligible for repair reimbursement. Those sidewalks, or any
portion of a sidewalk, deemed by the public health and safety committee of the
city of Spring Valley to be unsafe shall be replaced and the entire cost to
replace an unsafe portion of sidewalk will be paid by the city of Spring
Valley. Those sidewalks deemed to be eligible for repair reimbursement will be
subject to repair reimbursement pursuant to the repair reimbursement provisions
of this article. (Ord. 1569, 6-23-2014)
8-7A-3: PRIORITIZING SIDEWALKS:
In determining which sidewalks are deemed to be unsafe, the Spring Valley
public health and safety committee shall meet and prioritize those sidewalks
deemed by the city of Spring Valley to be unsafe. In reaching this
determination, the Spring Valley city council shall consider the following
factors: a) the extent to which the sidewalk in question is in need of repair;
b) the amount of pedestrian traffic on the sidewalk; and c) any other factors
which the Spring Valley public health and safety committee deems to be
appropriate in prioritizing sidewalks for repair under the Spring Valley
sidewalk program. (Ord. 1569, 6-23-2014)
8-7A-4: REIMBURSEMENT:
The Spring Valley city council, through the Spring Valley public health and
safety committee, shall also determine and classify those sidewalks which are
deemed by the city of Spring Valley to be eligible for repair reimbursement. If
the city of Spring Valley determines that either an entire sidewalk or a
portion of a sidewalk is eligible for repair reimbursement, the city of Spring
Valley will reimburse the adjacent property owner for the cost incurred by the
adjacent property owner for the concrete used to repair all or that portion of
the sidewalk deemed eligible for repair reimbursement. The city of Spring
Valley will reimburse the adjacent property owner for the cost of the concrete
used to repair all or that portion of the sidewalk deemed eligible for repair
within thirty (30) days after the city of Spring Valley receives a paid receipt
from the business supplying the concrete or the contractor performing the
repair work which specifically itemizes the cost of the concrete. The adjacent
property owner must also submit to the city of Spring Valley proof that all
costs associated with the sidewalk repair have been paid by adjacent property
owner to qualify for reimbursement from the city of Spring Valley. (Ord. 1569,
6-23-2014)
8-7A-5: SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION APPLICATION:
In order for a sidewalk to be deemed eligible for repair reimbursement by the
city of Spring Valley, the adjacent property owner must complete the sidewalk
construction application and return the sidewalk construction application to
the Spring Valley city clerk's office. The Spring Valley building inspector
will review the sidewalk construction application and make an on site
inspection to determine whether all or a portion of the sidewalk is eligible
for repair reimbursement from the city of Spring Valley. The building inspector
will forward his recommendations to the Spring Valley public health and safety
committee. The building inspector's recommendations will be reviewed by the
public health and safety committee and the recommendations of the public health
and safety committee will be forwarded to the Spring Valley city council for
final approval. After final approval by the Spring Valley city council the
adjacent property owner will be notified, in writing, by the city of Spring
Valley as to what portion of the sidewalk is eligible for repair reimbursement
under the terms of this article. (Ord. 1569, 6-23-2014)
8-7A-6: TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETION OF REPAIR WORK:
Any adjacent property owner submitting a sidewalk construction application to
the city of Spring Valley must complete the repair work and provide
documentation to the city of Spring Valley that all costs associated with the
sidewalk repair have been paid within forty five (45) days of approval of the
sidewalk construction application. Any adjacent property owner submitting a
sidewalk construction application who does not complete the work and provide
the city of Spring Valley with documentation that all costs associated with the
sidewalk repair have been paid within forty five (45) days shall forfeit their
entitlement to receive reimbursement from the city of Spring Valley. For good
cause shown, the Spring Valley city council may extend the forty five (45) day
period, if the adjacent property owner provides the city of Spring Valley with
a written request to extend the forty five (45) day repair period set forth in
this article. (Ord. 1569, 6-23-2014)
8-7A-7: ALLOCATION OF FUNDS:
The city of Spring Valley will allocate funds to the sidewalk repair program on
an annual basis by no later than May 15 of each year. After the city of Spring
Valley makes its allocation, the city of Spring Valley will notify the public
that it is accepting sidewalk construction applications from adjacent property
owners who wish to take advantage of the concrete reimbursement for those
sidewalks deemed to be eligible for repair reimbursement by the city of Spring
Valley.
If the city of Spring Valley receives more sidewalk construction applications
requesting funds for concrete reimbursement than the amount of money allocated
by the city of Spring Valley for sidewalk repair, the Spring Valley public
health and safety committee shall prioritize the sidewalk construction
applications which the public health and safety committee recommends to the
Spring Valley city council for approval based upon a decision by the public
health and safety committee as to which sidewalks are most in need of repair.
(Ord. 1569, 6-23-2014)
8-7A-8: APPROVED WORK NOT DONE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT FUNDS:
If an adjacent property owner submits a sidewalk construction application to
the city of Spring Valley which is approved by the Spring Valley city council,
but the construction work is not performed prior to November 1 of the year in
which the sidewalk construction application was submitted to the city of Spring
Valley and approved by the city of Spring Valley due to insufficient funds in
the sidewalk repair program, the adjacent owner must submit a new sidewalk
construction application to the city of Spring Valley after the city of Spring
Valley allocates additional funds to the sidewalk repair program in May of the
following fiscal year. (Ord. 1569, 6-23-2014)
8-7A-9: PROPERTY OWNER RESPONSIBILITIES:
Any repair or replacement of sidewalks pursuant to this article must comply
with all of the requirements of the Americans with disabilities act and any
other applicable Spring Valley city ordinances dealing with sidewalk
construction. The adjacent property owner is responsible for replacement of any
sod or grass disturbed or removed in the construction process. The adjacent
property owner must contact the building inspector after the sidewalk has been
repaired to inspect the construction work. An adjacent property owner will not
be eligible for repair reimbursement under the terms of this article until the
Spring Valley building inspector inspects the sidewalk repair and advises the
city of Spring Valley that the sidewalk has been repaired in accordance with
the provisions of this article and all other applicable Spring Valley municipal
ordinances. (Ord. 1569, 6-23-2014)

procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
      10.   Ensure efficient and safe use of public spaces by preventing
simultaneous work by two (2) or more applicants that could lead to operational
conflicts and jeopardize public safety.
   (C)   Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require certain utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
chapter, to the extent authorized by applicable law.
   (E)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. To the extent
authorized by applicable law and in the event that a utility other than a
telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or similar agreement with
the city, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control
during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers. To the extent authorized by applicable
law and in the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the
provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any franchise, license or
similar agreement between the city and any telecommunications provider, the
provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and
control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension
thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound Engineering Judgment: The city shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the city so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city
to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety
and welfare. (Ord. 1911, 3-3-2025)

work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 1911, 3-3-2025)
8-11-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS AND GPS LOCATIONS:
   (A)   Revised Permit Drawings: In the event that the actual locations of any
facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the
plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the
permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify the locations of the actual
facilities constructed within the right-of-way and where the locations of the
actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any
deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter,
it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section 8-11-
21 of this chapter. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
   (B)   GPS Locations: The permittee shall provide, upon request by the
superintendent of public works, GPS locations illustrating the actual locations
of all of the facilities constructed by the permittee. (Ord. 1911, 3-3-2025)
8-11-8: INSURANCE:

         (b)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
      3.   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the city.

following endorsement:
      "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled
nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt
by the city, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the mayor of such intent to cancel or not to
renew."
      2.   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the city of said notice, and
in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility
shall obtain and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (A) above. A
utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds
under subsection (A) above, or the requirements of subsections (B), (C) and (D)
above. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (A) above, such as
evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer" under the workers
compensation act.
   (F)   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.

appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 1911, 3-3-2025)
8-11-10: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
(B) shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the State
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the city superintendent of public works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely
to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one (1) location or a related group of locations,
and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to
substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the city
superintendent of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow
the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to
each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security
fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would
have been required under the provisions of this subsection (C) for any single
phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection (D), may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within
the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection (C) above.
   (F)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (C) above.
   (G)   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 1911, 3-3-2025)
8-11-11: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:

cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their

permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The city will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the international society of
arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The city may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The city may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the city and at the utility's expense.
   (B)   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
city superintendent of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the city police shall be notified immediately.

shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this
chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The city superintendent of public
works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One (1) or more conditions not under the control of the utility
(such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision impractical or
unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the city superintendent of public works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the city
superintendent of public works under the provisions of this chapter shall have
the right to appeal to the city council, or such other board or commission as
it may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to
the city clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The city council shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the council's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The city
council shall timely decide the appeal. (Ord. 1911, 3-3-2025)

further remedies that the city may have for enforcement of this chapter. (Ord.
1911, 3-3-2025)
8-11-23: PENALTY:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fines in accordance
with chapter 1-4 of this code. There may be times when the city will incur
delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will
not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless the
utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested
action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's costs of damages and
its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the
facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or
commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the
city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs
apportioned to it. (Ord. 1911, 3-3-2025)

interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   No Collocation On Electric Distribution System Poles: The wireless
provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on City utility poles
that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the
communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the
pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the City utility pole and on the top
of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies
with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Public Safety Compliance: The wireless provider shall comply with
all applicable codes, including acoustic regulations, and local code provisions
or regulations that concern public safety.

of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic
district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the City may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within two hundred
feet (200') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility
pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in
place on the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located
within three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or
wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the City, provided the City may designate which
intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
         (b)   Fifty feet (50') above ground level. The fifty foot (50') limit
provided by FCC regulation replaces the limit of forty five feet (45') under
the Act.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in the Spring Valley Illinois Land Development Code.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the City and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to

utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this
period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility pole or
by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty
(360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void
unless the City grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that

facilities subject to this chapter.

A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the City on the
effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the City
makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two
(2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the City

provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph.
   (G)   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the City an

provider of the abandonment.
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt

provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety (90) days
of such notice, the City may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the City if it sells or
transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the City. Such
notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider. (Ord. 1726, 7-2-2018; amd. Ord. 1845, 6-20-2022)

The Circuit Court of Bureau County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve
all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act.
Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on Municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
City shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per Municipal

all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or
arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the City
improvements or right-of- way associated with such improvements by the wireless
provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless provider has no
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as
may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the City or its employees or
agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have
against the City with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability. (Ord. 1726, 7-2-2018)
8-13-6: INSURANCE:

expense, the following insurance:
   (A)   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
   (B)   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; and
   (C)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities
on the City improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection limits
consistent with its requirements of other users of City improvements or rights-
of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage.
The wireless provider shall include the City as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the City in a commercial general liability policy prior to the
collocation of any wireless facility.
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirement required by the City. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the City evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self- insure the insurance
coverage limits required by the City. (Ord. 1726, 7-2-2018; amd. Ord. 1845, 6-

must be furnished with screening that is at least six feet (6') in height.
Screening elements can consist of landscaping, berming, fences, and/or walls.
Where a fence, wall, or berm is proposed, landscaping must be used to soften
its appearance within the required buffer strip. Where only landscaping is
utilized, it must consist of a dense planting of deciduous trees, evergreens,
and shrubs that will provide year round screening at a minimum height of six
feet (6'). Fences or walls must not contain electrical charges, barbed wire,
broken glass, or other material designed to inflict bodily harm.
      20.   Water Supply:
         (a)   General: All manufactured home parks must be served by public
water supplies. All such public water supplies must be capable of providing a
sufficient supply of potable water under adequate pressure, to facilities for

safety or warning signs in appropriate locations.
      2.   Preferred Sites: When a wireless provider is considering locations
for wireless communications facilities, city owned sites are considered
preferred sites. Prior to applying for a building permit or special use permit,
the provider must contact the city to determine whether there is a city owned
site or facility available that would meet its locational criteria.
      3.   Collocation Of Antenna On Existing Structures:
         (a)   Antenna Design: The antenna and associated equipment of such a
collocated facility must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely
compatible with, the color of the supporting structure or building so as to
make the antenna and associated equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
         (b)   Collocation On An Existing Wireless Communication Facility:
Installation of a wireless antenna and associated equipment on an existing
wireless communication facility is a permitted use in all zoning districts.
         (c)   Collocation By Attachment To An Existing Structure: This
subsection addresses the installation of a tower or antenna on an existing
structure, other than a wireless communication facility tower, including, but
not limited to, buildings, light poles, water towers, commercial signs, church
steeples, and any other freestanding structures. Installation of a wireless
antenna and associated equipment on an existing structure, other than an
existing wireless communication facility, is a permitted use in all zoning
districts, subject to site plan review. Where the facility is proposed on a
city owned structure, the Plan Commission has the authority to forward the site
plan to the city council for review and approval. Such collocated facilities,
including associated equipment and accessory structures, are subject to the
following minimum standards:
            (1)   R, B1 And B3 Districts: In the residential (R) districts and
the B1 and B3 districts, such collocated facilities may not extend above the
highest point of the existing structure by more than:
               A. Ten feet (10'), if the structure is up to forty feet (40') in
height; or
               B. Fifteen feet (15'), if the structure is more than forty feet
(40') in height.
            (2)   Other B, M, And A Districts: In all business (B) districts
other than those specified in subsection (H)3(c)(1) of this section; the
manufacturing (M) districts; and the agricultural (A) district; such collocated
facilities may not extend above the highest point of the existing structure by
more than fifteen feet (15').
            (3)   City Owned Sites: The height of collocated facilities on city
owned sites or facilities may not extend above the highest point of the
existing structure by more than fifteen feet (15').
      4.   Freestanding Facilities: Freestanding facilities require special use
approval. An application for a freestanding facility must include an affidavit
of intent committing the site owner, his successors and assigns, the operator,
and his successors and assigns to allow the shared use of the proposed tower
and to offer at least one potential additional user reasonable terms and
conditions for collocation. Failure to abide by such commitment constitutes a
violation of this chapter and may result in revocation of the building permit
associated with the facility.
         (a)   Demonstration Of Need: Special use approval may not be granted
unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the plan
commission and city council that no existing facility or structure can
accommodate the applicant's proposed facility. Evidence submitted to
demonstrate that no existing facility or structure can accommodate the
applicant's proposed facility may consist of any of the following:
            (1)   No existing wireless communication facilities are located
within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering
requirements.
            (2)   Existing wireless communication facilities are not of
sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
            (3)   Existing wireless communication facilities do not have
sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and
associated equipment.
            (4)   The applicant's proposed facility would cause electromagnetic
interference with an antenna on the existing tower, or vice versa.
            (5)   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing wireless communication facility, or to
adapt an existing wireless communication facility for sharing, are
unreasonable. Costs exceeding new facility development are presumed to be
unreasonable.
         (b)   Maximum Height: No freestanding facility may have a maximum
height that is more than two hundred feet (200'). Within the two hundred foot
(200') height limit, the facility must accommodate collocation of other
facilities. Freestanding facilities located on city owned sites will have a
height limit that is imposed by the city council.
         (c)   Setbacks:
            (1)   In business and agriculture districts, freestanding
facilities must be set back a minimum of thirty feet (30') from the rear
property line and twenty feet (20') from the front and side property lines. On
a corner lot, the twenty foot (20') setback requirement applies to both
property lines fronting on the public right of way.
            (2)   In manufacturing districts, freestanding facilities must be
set back a minimum of thirty feet (30') from a property line that serves as a
common boundary line between an M and an R district, ten feet (10') from side
property lines, and twenty feet (20') from any public right of way lines. On a
corner lot, the twenty foot (20') setback requirement applies to both property
lines fronting on the public right of way.
         (d)   Number Of Towers Per Zoning Lot: There may be no more than one
freestanding facility per zoning lot.
         (e)   Tower Design: Towers must be of monopole construction
(cylindrical, tapering steel tubes without guywires or lattice design). Towers
must be constructed so that if a failure does occur, the tower will collapse
into itself and will not fall onto structures near the site.
         (f)   Security Fencing: Freestanding facilities must be enclosed by
security fencing not less than six feet (6') in height and must also be
equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device. The anticlimbing device may
not include barbed wire, razor wire, or similar sharp barrier.
         (g)   Landscaping:
            (1)   Wireless communication facilities must be landscaped with a
buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the base of the
tower and associated equipment from residential properties that are adjacent to
or across the street from the site.
            (2)   The standard buffer must consist of a landscape strip at
least five feet (5') wide outside the perimeter of the facility. In locations
where the visual impact of the facility would be minimal, the landscaping
requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
            (3)   Existing mature trees (more than 3 inches in diameter) and
natural landforms on the site must be preserved to the maximum extent possible.
If mature trees are removed, the same number of trees must be planted on the
site within six (6) months following completion of the tower. In some cases,
such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
         (h)   Abandonment Or Discontinuation Of Use Of Facilities:
            (1)   At such time as the operator of a wireless communication
facility plans to abandon or discontinue operation of the facility, the
operator must notify the zoning administrator by certified mail of the proposed
date of abandonment or discontinuation of operation. Such notice must be given
no less than thirty (30) days before abandonment or discontinuation of
operation.
            (2)   In the event that the operator fails to give such notice, the
facility will be deemed abandoned upon such discontinuation of operation.
            (3)   Upon such abandonment or discontinuation of use, the operator
must physically remove the wireless communication facility within one hundred
twenty (120) days from the date of abandonment or discontinuation of use.
"Physically remove" includes, but is not limited to:
               A. Removal of tower, antennas, mount, equipment shelters or
platforms and security barriers from the subject property;
               B. Proper disposal of the waste materials from the site in
accordance with applicable solid waste disposal regulations; and
               C. Restoration of the location of the wireless communication
facility to its natural condition, except that any landscaping and grading must
remain.
            (4)   In the event that the operator fails to remove a wireless
communication facility in accordance with the provisions of this subsection,
upon the city's provision of thirty (30) days' written notice to the operator,
the city or its agents have the authority to enter the subject property and
physically remove the facility. The operator of the facility, or the owner if
different from the operator, is liable to the city for all costs associated
with entry and removal. This liability will be collectible in the same manner
as any other personal liability.
         (i)   Review And Approval Procedures:
            (1)   A building permit is required for each wireless communication
facility installation.
            (2)   When a wireless communication facility requires special use
approval, such approval must be obtained before any building permit may be
issued.
            (3)   Each applicant requesting a permit for a wireless
communication facility must submit with the application a scaled site plan and
a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations and other
documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals,
showing:
               A.   The location and dimension of all improvements;
               B.   Information concerning topography;
               C.   Radio frequency coverage;
               D.   Tower height requirements and setbacks;
               E.   Drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, and adjacent uses;
and
               F.   Any other information deemed by the zoning administrator to
be necessary to assess compliance with this title.
            (4)   Approved wireless communication facilities may be transferred
to successors and assigns of the approved party, subject to all of the
conditions that apply to initial approval.
         (j)   Waiver: In reviewing a special use request, the plan commission
and city council may waive any of the nonfederally mandated requirements of
this subsection pertaining to height limitations, setback requirements, and
landscaping if it determines that the goals of this subsection are better
served thereby.
            (1)   The setback requirements may be modified if the applicant
shows, to the satisfaction of the plan commission and city council, that such
modification will result in a reduction of the visual impact of the wireless
communication facility.
            (2)   The height requirements may be modified if the applicant
shows, to the satisfaction of the plan commission and city council, that
additional height is necessary to enable the applicant to meet its service
coverage requirements, and the facility will be constructed to safely and
effectively accommodate collocation of one or more wireless communication
facilities.
            (3)   The landscaping requirements may be modified if the applicant
shows, to the satisfaction of the plan commission and city council, that the
required landscaping is unnecessary for screening purposes, due to the proposed
location of the facility and lack of visibility from neighboring properties
and/or public right of way. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)

            (1)   Roof Or Building-Mounted Solar Energy Systems: In addition to
the building setback, the collector surface and mounting devices for roof-
mounted solar energy systems shall not extend beyond the exterior perimeter of
the building on which the system is mounted or built, unless the collector and
mounting system has been explicitly engineered to safely extend beyond the
edge, and setback standards are not violated. Exterior piping for solar hot
water systems shall be allowed to extend beyond the perimeter of the building
on a side yard exposure. Solar collectors mounted on the sides of buildings and
serving as awnings are considered to be building-integrated systems and are
regulated as awnings.
            (2)   Ground-Mounted Solar Energy Systems: Ground-mounted solar
energy systems may not extend into the side-yard or rear setback when oriented
at minimum design tilt, except as otherwise allowed for building mechanical
systems.
         (c)   Visibility: Active solar energy systems shall be designed to
blend into the architecture of the building or be screened from routine view
from public right-of-ways other than alleys provide that screening shall not
affect the operation of the system. The color of the solar collector is not
required to be consistent with other roofing materials.
            (1)   Building Integrated Photovoltaic Systems: Building integrated
photovoltaic solar energy systems shall be allowed regardless of whether the
system is visible from the public right-of-way, provided the building component
in which the system is integrated meets all required setback, land use or
performance standards for the district in which the building is located.
            (2)   Solar Energy Systems With Mounting Devices: Solar energy
systems using roof mounting devices or ground-mount solar energy systems shall
not be restricted if the system is not visible from the closest edge of any
public right-of-way other than an alley. Roof-mount systems that are visible
from the nearest edge of the street frontage right-of-way shall not have a
highest finished pitch steeper than the roof pitch on which the system is
mounted, and shall be no higher than twelve inches (12") above the roof.
            (3)   Reflectors: All solar energy systems using a reflector to
enhance solar production shall minimize glare from the reflector affecting
adjacent or nearby properties. Measures to minimize glare include selective
placement of the system, screening on the north side of the solar array,
modifying the orientation of the system, reducing use of the reflector system,
or other remedies that limit glare.
         (d)   Coverage: Roof or building mounted solar energy systems,
excluding building-integrated systems, shall allow for adequate roof access for

1379, 6-9-2008)
14-4-3: MEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONS:
   (A)   Lot Area, Total:
      1.   Measurement: Lot area includes the total land area contained within
the property lines of a lot. No lot, yard, parking area, building area, or
other space may be reduced in area or dimension so as not to meet the
provisions of this code. No part of any lot, yard, parking area, or other space
required for a structure or use may be used for any other structure or use on
an adjoining lot.
      2.   Exceptions For Nonconforming Lots Of Record: There are reduced
minimum lot area requirements for certain nonconforming lots of record. See
section
14-12-6 of this title for rules regarding nonconforming lots of record.
      3.   Exceptions For Lots Not Serviced By Public Sewers: On lots with on
site sewage disposal systems, the minimum lot area may be required to be
increased so that the lot size is sufficient to permit the use of an on site
sewage disposal system designed in accordance with state of Illinois department
of public health requirements. The minimum lot area for an on site sewage
disposal system is established by the criteria included in chapter 9 of this
title.
   (B)   Lot Area Per Dwelling Unit:
      1.   Measurement: The lot area per dwelling unit refers to the minimum
amount of lot area that is required for each dwelling unit on the property. For
residential or mixed use development, dwelling unit density is controlled
through a minimum lot area per dwelling unit standard.
      2.   Rounding: When the number of dwelling units yielded by the density
calculation results in a fraction, the fraction must be rounded down to the
previous whole number. For example, if a minimum lot area per unit standard of
six thousand (6,000) square feet is applied to a fifteen thousand (15,000)
square foot lot, a maximum of two (2) dwelling units would be allowed on the
property.
   (C)   Lot Width:
      1.   Measurement: Lot width is measured between side property lines at
the required front setback.
      2.   Exceptions For Nonconforming Lots Of Record: There are reduced
minimum lot width requirements for certain nonconforming lots of record. See
section
14-12-6 of this title for rules governing nonconforming lots of record.
   (D)   Front Setback:
      1.   Measurement: The front setback is to be measured from the front
property line to the closest point of the structure on the subject lot, not
including those projections and features allowed to project into the front
setback pursuant to subsection (J) of this section. On a corner lot, the front
setback is to be measured from the property line that abuts a street and is
generally parallel to the front of the building. For the purposes of this
subsection, the front of the building is the facade with the primary building
entrance. Where the location of the primary building entrance is unclear or two
(2) or more entrances are present, the final determination will be made by the
zoning administrator.
      2.   Use: Required setbacks must be unobstructed and unoccupied from the
ground to the sky except as expressly allowed in subsection (J) of this
section.
      3.   Exception For Lots that Utilize Average Front Setback: As an
alternative to the front setback requirements of section
14-4-1 or
14-4-2 of this chapter, uses in all residential and B3 districts may determine
the required front setback based on the average front setback pursuant to
subsection (E) of this section.
   (E)   Average Front Setback:
      1.   Alternative: In all residential and B3 districts, as an alternative
to the front setback requirements of section
14-4-1 or
14-4-2 of this chapter, the front setback may be reduced to the average front
setback whenever buildings exist on one or more adjoining lots.
      2.   Measurement: The front setback, as measured on the subject lot and
adjoining lots, is to be measured from the front property line to the closest
point of the structure on the respective lot, not including those projections
and features allowed to project into the front setback pursuant to subsection
(J) of this section. On a corner lot, the front setback is to be measured from
the property line that abuts a street and is generally parallel with the front
of the building. For the purposes of this section, the front of the building is
the facade with the primary building entrance.
         (a)   When utilizing the average front setback, it must be at least as
deep as the average of the front setbacks on the two (2) lots on either side of
the subject lot, in accordance with the following rules:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/8b0aecc83a61ef327209c62de835d91c353a24c2/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2470.gif]
 
         (b)   Lots that are separated from the subject lot by a street or
railroad right of way cannot be used in computing the average. Lots that are
separated from the subject lot by an alley can be used in computing the
average.

      3.   Use: Required setbacks must be unobstructed and unoccupied from the
ground to the sky except as expressly allowed in subsection (J) of this
section.
   (F)   Rear Setback:
      1.   Measurement: The rear setback is to be measured from the rear
property line to the closest point of the structure on the subject lot, not
including those projections and features allowed to project into the rear
setback pursuant to subsection (J) of this section. On pie shaped or triangular
lots with side property lines that come to a point at the rear, the rear
setback is measured from a line segment that connects the side property lines
and is a minimum of ten feet (10') in length.
      2.   Use: Required setbacks must be unobstructed and unoccupied from the
ground to the sky except as expressly allowed in subsection (J) of this
section.
   (G)   Interior Side Setback:
      1.   Measurement: The interior side setback is to be measured from the
interior side property line to the closest point of the structure on the
subject lot, not including those projections and features allowed to project
into the interior side setback pursuant to subsection (J) of this section.
      2.   Use: Required interior setbacks must be unobstructed and unoccupied
from the ground to the sky except as expressly allowed in subsection (J) of
this section.
   (H)   Corner Side Setback:
      1.   Measurement: The corner side setback is to be measured from the side
property line that abuts a street to the closest point of the structure on the
subject lot, not including those projections and features allowed to project
into the corner side setback pursuant to subsection (J) of this section. The
corner side setback is measured from the side property line that abuts a
street, and is generally perpendicular to the front of the building. For the
purposes of this subsection, the front of the building is the facade with the
primary building entrance.
      2.   Use: Required corner setbacks must be unobstructed and unoccupied
from the ground to the sky except as expressly allowed in subsection (J) of
this section.
   (I)   Through Lot Setbacks: On through lots, the two (2) property lines
(opposing) that abut public right of way lines are considered front property
lines and front setback requirements apply. Through lots with three (3)
property lines that abut public right of way lines will have two (2) front
property lines and one corner side property line where front and corner side
setback requirements apply, respectively. Rear setback standards do not apply.
   (J)   Exceptions From Minimum Setback Requirements: Required setbacks must
be unobstructed and unoccupied from the ground to the sky except that certain
building features and structures are allowed to project into required setbacks

   Note:
      1.    In the B1 downtown commercial district, these features are allowed
to project into the public right of way as far as they may project into
required front and corner side setbacks.
   (K)   Building Height: Building height is to be measured from the average
elevation of the finished grade adjoining the front building line to:
      1.   The average height level between the eaves and ridge for gable, hip,
and gambrel roofs.
      2.   The highest point of the roof surface for a flat roof; and
      3.   The deck line of a mansard roof.

   (L)   Exceptions To Maximum Height Requirements: Certain structures and
features may exceed the maximum permitted height requirements stipulated
elsewhere in this chapter.
      1.   The following are exempt from the height requirements of this
chapter:
         (a)   Architectural projections such as spires, belfries, parapet
walls, cupolas, domes, flues and chimneys.

      1.   Building coverage is to be measured as the percentage of lot area
that is covered with principal and accessory buildings and above grade
structures, including garages, sheds, gazebos, decks, porches, and swimming
pools (except for temporary inflatable swimming pools). Projecting roof eaves
on buildings are not counted in calculating building coverage. At grade
accessory structures such as driveways, patios, walkways, and other paved
surfaces on a lot are not included in the calculation of maximum building
coverage.
      2.   Garages may not cover more than thirty percent (30%) of the combined
area of rear and side yards. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)

   (B)   Rules For Computing Requirements:
      1.   Multiple Uses: Lots containing more than one use must provide
parking equal to the total number of spaces required for all uses unless a
shared parking plan is approved according to section
14-5-4 of this chapter.
      2.   Fractions: When the calculation of required parking spaces results
in a fraction, any fraction of one-half (1/2) or more must be rounded to the
next whole number and any fraction less than one-half (1/2) must be rounded
down to the preceding whole number.
      3.   Area Measurements: All square footage based parking requirements are
based on gross floor area.
      4.   Occupancy Or Capacity Based Standards: All occupancy or capacity
based parking requirements are based on the largest number of individuals
working on a single shift, the maximum enrollment, or the maximum occupancy
based on the building code, whichever is applicable and whichever results in
the greater number of spaces. For uses with benches or similar seating, one
seat consists of twenty two (22) linear inches of bench length.
      5.   Uses Not Listed: In the case of structures or uses not mentioned in
this section the zoning administrator must determine which standard is most
appropriate. The zoning administrator may require the applicant to submit a
parking study or other evidence to help determine the most appropriate parking
standard for the proposed use.

in a residential zoning district except parking spaces required for
nonresidential uses allowed in the district.
      3.   No parking space or driveway may be closer than three feet (3') to
any property line.
      4.   In RE, R1A and R1 districts, all parking spaces for nonresidential
uses must be located behind the front building line.
      5.   In R3 districts, at least one of the required parking spaces for
each dwelling unit must be enclosed in a garage that is set back at least five
feet (5') from all property lines.

The zoning administrator may approve shared parking facilities for developments
or uses with different operating hours or peak business periods, subject to the
following requirements:
   (A)   Location: The edge of the shared parking area must be within six
hundred feet (600') walking distance of the primary entrance of each use
served.
   (B)   Parking Study: Applicants wishing to use shared parking as a way to
satisfy the parking requirements of this chapter must submit a parking study to
the zoning administrator. The parking study must demonstrate the feasibility of
the shared parking arrangement; and include the size and use of the proposed
development, the anticipated parking demand for each use in the development,
and the peak periods of parking demand for each use.
   (C)   Shared Parking Covenant: A shared parking plan must be enforced by an
irrevocable written covenant among all owners of record. A copy of the covenant
must be submitted to the zoning administrator and recorded in county recorder's
office before any building permits are issued for any use to be served by the
shared parking area. A shared parking covenant may only be revoked if all off
street parking required by this chapter is provided. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)

14-6-1: LANDSCAPE PLAN:
   (A)   When Required:
      1.   A landscape plan is required for all exterior construction and
development activity that requires site plan review.
      2.   A landscape plan is not required for existing uses that are not
proposing redevelopment or exterior improvements that require site plan review
in accordance with chapter 11 of this title. Landscape plans must comply with
the requirements of this section and must be reviewed and approved by the plan
commission.
   (B)   Landscape Plan Contents: A required landscape plan must include the
following information:
      1.   The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed buildings,
structures, property lines, easements, parking lots, driveways, roadways,
sidewalks/bike paths, fences/walls, ground signs, refuse disposal areas, light
poles, freestanding mechanical equipment, drainage and stormwater management
facilities.
      2.   The location, quantity, size, and name (both botanical and common
names) of all existing plant materials on the site, and any plant material in
the public right of way, indicating which plant material will be retained or
removed.
      3.   The location, quantity, size, and name (both botanical and common
names) of all proposed plant material including, but not limited to, shade
trees, ornamental trees, evergreens, shrubs, ground covers and turf area.
      4.   The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours at
one foot (1') intervals, including any proposed berming.
      5.   Elevations of all proposed walls, fences and retaining walls,
including elevations for proposed screening for refuse disposal areas.
      6.   Details for proposed lighting, including specifications as to the
height, type of lamp and shielding.
      7.   The location of all off street loading areas, including an
indication of whether loading docks will be enclosed and methods of proposed
screening.
      8.   Locations of hose connections and other water system sources or
devices, if any.
      9.   The location and placement of all proposed water lines and sprinkler
heads of proposed irrigation systems.
      10.   The location of existing and proposed utility easements and the
type of utilities anticipated for placement within proposed easements and
existing utility lines, both above and below ground.
      11.   Delineation of the required intersection visibility triangle, where
applicable.
      12.   Other elevations and details as determined necessary by the zoning
administrator.
   (C)   Changes To Approved Landscape Plans: Any change to an approved
landscape plan requires the approval of the plan commission, unless the zoning
administrator determines that proposed change is minor in nature. Examples of
minor changes to approved landscape plans are minor rearranging of plant
material on a site and substitution of plant materials that are of a similar
species and/or equivalent size as the approved materials.
   (D)   Design Standards: Landscape plans must be prepared, evaluated, and
approved, based on the following design criteria:
      1.   The scale and nature of landscaping materials must be appropriate to
the size of the structures on the site. For example, larger scale plants should
generally be used to complement larger buildings. Plant material should be
selected for its form, texture, color, pattern of growth and suitability to
local conditions.
      2.   Existing plant material should be incorporated into the landscape
treatment of a site. Effort should be made to preserve and protect existing
trees with trunk diameters of more than twelve inches (12"). These trees and
their root systems must be protected from construction equipment and activity
by the installation of fencing materials at the drip line of the trees.
      3.   Plant material should be placed intermittently against long expanses
of building walls, fences, and other barriers to create a softening effect.
      4.   Detention/retention basins and ponds should be landscaped with shade
and ornamental trees, evergreens, shrubs, turf, ground cover and/or other plant
materials. Nonstructural methods of detention planted with native plant
materials are preferred.
      5.   Plant material should be used to reduce energy consumption needs by
placing deciduous trees on the south and west sides of buildings for shade and
placing evergreens on the north and west sides of buildings to dissipate the
effect of winds. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-2: TURF:
All required setbacks in all zoning districts within the city must be
landscaped primarily with turf or other ground cover plantings. The pavement of
yards other than for parking or loading purposes is prohibited. Turf may be
established through installation of sod or seeding. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-3: STREET TREES:
   (A)   Street Tree Requirements:
      1.   Street trees requirements for proposed residential subdivisions are
specified in section
14-9-11 of this title.
      2.   Property lines along public street frontages on multi-family
residential and nonresidential sites must be planted with street trees at a
rate of one tree for every forty (40) linear feet. These trees must be located
between the building line(s) and front and corner side property lines. Driveway
widths may be excluded from the calculation of the required number of street
trees. Flexibility in locating trees is provided where it is not possible to
locate street trees forty feet (40') apart due to the location of driveways.
      3.   The trees must be located within ten feet (10') of the front and
corner lot lines, but are not permitted to be planted within the public right
of way. Additionally, no trees may be planted in the visibility triangle of
corner lots, if the trees restrict the visibility of traffic on the
intersecting streets.
      4.   A list of allowable street tree species is on file with the city of
Spring Valley. To reduce the risk of disease and/or insect infestation, no more
than fifty percent (50%) of the street trees in any individual development may
be of one species.

   (B)   Other Landscape Materials In The Public Right Of Way: No plant
material or barrier, except as specified in this chapter, may be located in a
dedicated public right of way without the approval of the city's Superintendent
of Public Works. The remainder of the ground surface within the public right of
way between the street and sidewalk must be planted with turf, with the
exception that driveways, sidewalks, and bike paths are permitted in all public
rights of way.
   Materials prohibited within the public right of way, unless approved by the
street superintendent, include other ground covers, shrubs, brick pavers,
gravel, stone, asphalt and concrete; except those used for driveways,
sidewalks, and bike paths.
(Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008; amd. Ord. 1746, 4-22-2019)
14-6-4: PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING:
   (A)   Applicability: The owner of any parking lot desiring to install
landscaping must install landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
   (B)   Interior Parking Lot Landscaping:
      1.   Number Of Landscape Islands: Landscape islands with at least one
shade tree must occur at a minimum of one island for every ten (10) parking
spaces in a row. Islands are required at each end of a row of parking spaces.
Flexibility in placement of landscape islands may be allowed for creative
parking lot design and preservation of existing trees and vegetation.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2488.gif]
 
      2.   Landscape Island Size: Interior parking lot islands must be a
minimum of one hundred eighty (180) square feet in area and a minimum of eight
feet (8') in width, as measured from back of curb to back of curb within the
island.
      3.   Landscape Island Design: Interior parking lot landscaping must
consist of planting islands at least eight inches (8") above the surface of the
parking lot that are protected with concrete curbing.
      4.   Landscape Material: The primary plant materials used in parking lot
islands must be shade tree species. Ornamental trees, shrubs, and other plant
materials may be used to supplement the shade tree plantings, but cannot be the
sole source of parking lot landscaping. Mulch may be used around the base of
shade trees and other plant material, provided it is applied at a thickness of
at least two inches (2").
      5.   Visibility: To ensure proper visibility within the parking lot,
shrubs must be no greater than thirty inches (30") in height and the branches
of trees must have a minimum clearance of six feet (6') above the pavement
except in areas that do not affect driver visibility.
   (C)   Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping: Perimeter parking lot landscaping
provides for the enhancement and screening of parking lots by providing a
uniform scheme of landscaping and/or screening along all public streets and
adjacent to residential uses.
      1.   Parking Lots Abutting Public Streets: Where a parking lot abuts a
public right of way (whether a street or an alley), a minimum six foot (6')
wide continuous landscape strip must be provided along one hundred percent
(100%) of the right of way, exclusive of driveways. Screening installed within
this landscape strip must have a minimum height of three feet (3'). The
screening may consist of shrubs, ornamental trees, berming, low pedestrian
walls and/or fencing which through their arrangement create the desired screen.
In addition to the three foot (3') screen, one shade tree must be provided for
every forty (40) linear feet along that portion of parking lots that abut
public streets (alleys are excluded). These trees may be clustered or spaced
linearly.
      2.   Parking Lots Abutting Residential Property: Where a parking lot
abuts a property zoned or used for residential purposes, a solid wood fence,
wall, dense hedge, or comparable screen must be provided across one hundred
percent (100%) of the property line. Fences and walls must be six feet (6') in
height, and hedges and other screens must be a minimum height of six feet (6')
in height. In addition, one shade or evergreen tree must be provided for every
forty (40) linear feet along that portion of the parking lot that abuts
residential property. Additional shrubs, trees, and/or berming may be installed
to supplement the required screening. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-5: TRANSITION YARDS:
   (A)   A transition yard is landscaped open space, free of any building or
paved area. Transition yards are intended to lessen the impact of incompatible
land uses on adjacent properties.
   (B)   All transition yards must be planted with one shade tree per thirty
(30) linear feet and must have a continuous screen consisting of a berm, hedge,
fence or wall with a height as required by this section. The following lists
the transition yard width and screening height required:

   (C)   Existing vegetation may be used to meet all or some of the transition
yard requirements. The landscape design may include areas where trees and
shrubs are clustered or spaced linearly as long as the desired screen is
achieved. Evergreen trees may be substituted for shade trees and three (3)
ornamental trees may be substituted for one shade tree. All other areas within
transition yards must be maintained with turf or other ground cover.
   (D)   When both a transition yard and perimeter parking lot landscaping
would be required between a parking lot and a residential use, the stricter
standard applies. Sites are not required to provide both types of landscaping
and screening.
   (E)   It is recognized that providing full transition yards may not be
possible on small or irregularly shaped sites. When there is not adequate space
to meet transitional yard requirements without creating additional
nonconformities on the site with respect to setbacks, parking, etc., the plan
commission is authorized to approve alternative screening and/or a reduced
transitional yard area. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-6: REFUSE CONTAINERS:
   (A)   This section applies to all uses except single-family and two-family
dwellings. Single-family and two-family dwellings may utilize refuse containers
with a maximum five (5) 33-gallon capacity, not to exceed fifty (50) pounds in
weight when filled.
   (B)   When refuse containers and grease storage containers are not enclosed
within a principal or accessory building, they may only be placed in a rear or
interior side yard, and must be screened within an enclosure, subject to the
following requirements:
      1.   The enclosure must be constructed of an opaque wood fence or masonry
wall on three (3) sides with a minimum height equal to or greater than the
height of the refuse container. One side of the storage area must be furnished
with an opaque, lockable gate. No refuse material may be visible above the
enclosure.
      2.   The enclosure area must be kept free of debris. Refuse containers
must be emptied regularly and kept closed when not in use so that containers do
not attract vermin.
      3.   The provisions of this section apply to new construction after the
date of the adoption of this title. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-7: LOADING AREAS:
Loading areas in all zoning districts must be screened from the public right of
way and abutting properties that are zoned or used for residential purposes.
Appropriate methods of screening include walls, fences, berms, and landscape
plantings that are a minimum of six feet (6') in height. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-8: OUTDOOR STORAGE AND WORK AREAS:
Outdoor storage and work areas must be screened from the public right of way
and abutting properties that are zoned or used for residential purposes.
Appropriate methods of screening include walls, fences, berms and landscape
plantings.
Walls and fences must be six feet (6') in height; landscape screens must be a
minimum of six feet (6') in height. No stored materials may be visible above
the fence or landscape screen. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-9: MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT:
Mechanical equipment such as transformers and heating and air conditioning
(HVAC) units must be located and/or screened so that they are not visible from
any property line.
   (A)   Ground Mounted Equipment: Ground mounted equipment in all
nonresidential development must be screened with a dense hedge that is of
sufficient height to screen the mechanical unit on all sides visible from any
property line.
   (B)   Roof Mounted Equipment: Roof mounted mechanical equipment in all
nonresidential and multi-family residential development must be screened on all
sides visible from any property line. Screening may include parapet walls or
other opaque roof elements similar and compatible in color and texture to the
exterior building materials on which the unit is located. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-10: FREESTANDING SIGNS:
Landscape material must be installed around the base of the freestanding signs
consisting of shrubs, perennial/annual flowers, and/or ground cover. The
required landscaping area must be a minimum of three feet (3') wide on all
sides of the sign base. Where the area around the base of the sign is
insufficient in size for all of the required landscaping, the zoning
administrator may permit installation of a portion of the required landscaping
at an alternate location on the site. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-11: PLANT MATERIALS:
   (A)   Selection: All planting materials must be good quality and of species
capable of withstanding the climate of central Illinois and individual site
microclimates. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of planting
and at maturity, are additional criteria that must be considered when selecting
plant material. The use of drought tolerant and salt tolerant plant material is
preferred. Trees and shrubs may be balled and burlapped or container grown.
   (B)   Minimum Planting Sizes: Minimum planting sizes for all required
landscape materials are as follows:
 
Type             Size
Shade trees      2 inch caliper
Ornamental trees 6 feet height unless true dwarf species
Evergreen trees  6 feet height
Deciduous shrubs 2 feet height
Evergreen shrubs 2 feet height
 
   (C)   Installation:
      1.   Required landscaping and screening must be completely installed
prior to the issuance of a letter of occupancy.
      2.   All landscaping materials must be installed in accordance with the
current planting procedures established by the American Association Of
Nurserymen.
      3.   All plant material must be free from disease and installed in a
fashion that ensures the availability of sufficient soil and water to sustain
healthy growth.
      4.   Plant material must be installed in a manner that is not intrusive
to utilities or pavement.
      5.   Plant materials identified on approved landscaping plans must be
installed, whenever feasible, within the growing season following approval of
the applicable building permits for the subject site. Where it is not feasible
to install all required landscaping within that growing season due to weather
constraints, the zoning administrator has the authority to grant a letter of
occupancy for the building, provided that all required landscaping will be
installed the next growing season. If determined necessary by the zoning
administrator, a performance guarantee may be required to be posted by the
property owner to ensure installation of all required landscape materials
within the next growing season.
   (D)   Planting Methods: This subsection outlines general guidelines for the
installation of all landscape material.
      1.   Most small, deciduous trees may be moved bare rooted unless
otherwise indicated. Roots of bare rooted trees must be protected against
drying out.
      2.   All coniferous trees must be moved balled and burlapped. Balled
roots should be prevented from drying out at the surface of their ball, and
they should be protected from freezing.
      3.   Pits dug for the planting of bare root plants must be at least
twelve inches (12") larger in diameter than the diameter of the root system in
order to accommodate the roots without crowding. For balled trees, the pits
should be a minimum of twelve inches (12") larger than the diameter of the ball
of soil to allow proper backfill of soil.
      4.   Plants must be planted no deeper than previously grown with due
allowance for settling.
      5.   In planting containers, artificial drainage must be provided for the
root system of any species intolerant of wet sites, or species tolerant to wet
sites must be used.
      6.   Topsoil, compost, peat moss or an acceptable soil mixture may be
placed around the roots of bare root stock or in the backfill around balled
stock. When the planting is completed, the entire root system must be
thoroughly saturated with water and cord and burlap wrapping must be cut and/or
removed.
      7.   Trees and planting beds must be mulched around the base of plant
material with shredded bark, feather rocks, or similar organic materials to
hold moisture. Mulch cannot be used as a substitute for turf or required plant
materials.
      8.   Although pruning should be done to develop a balance with the root
system, excessive pruning at the time of transplanting should be avoided.
      9.   Tree trunks must be suitably wrapped and guyed, or supported in an
upright position, according to accepted arboricultural practices. The guys or
supports should be installed so that they will not girdle or cause serious
injury to the tree or endanger public safety.
   (E)   Maintenance:
      1.   While irrigation systems are not required for landscape areas, where
installed irrigation systems are installed they must be designed to conserve
the use of water.
      2.   All landscaping materials must be continually maintained in good
condition to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and be kept free
of refuse and debris. Fences, walls and berms must be maintained in good
condition and neat appearance. Plant material berms, walls and fences must be
protected from damage by motor vehicles through use of concrete curbing or
wheel stops.
      3.   All landscaping should be periodically trimmed so that it does not
obstruct a public right of way. Diseased and dead plant material must be
replaced in accordance with the approved landscape plan.
      4.   The owner and occupants of a property are jointly responsible for
the maintenance, repair, and replacement of all plant materials, fences, walls
and other landscape improvements. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-6-12: FENCES, WALLS AND BERMS:
Fences and walls must be designed in accordance with the following standards:
   (A)   Location: Fences and walls, including all posts, bases and other
structural parts must be located completely within the boundaries of the lot on

   (A)   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to achieve balance among the
following differing, and at times, competing goals:
      1.   To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication
for businesses, organizations and individuals in Spring Valley;
      2.   To provide a means of wayfinding in the community, thus reducing
traffic confusion and congestion;
      3.   To provide for adequate business identification, advertising, and
communication;
      4.   To prohibit signs of such excessive size and number that they
obscure one another to the detriment of the economic and social well being of
the city of Spring Valley;

hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic;
      6.   To preserve property values by preventing unsightly and chaotic
development which has a blighting influence upon the community;
      7.   To differentiate among those signs that, because of their location,
may distract drivers on public streets and those that may provide information
to them while they remain in their cars but out of active traffic;
      8.   To minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public
and private property; and
      9.   To implement the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan,
including the following:
         (a)   Adopt more context appropriate signage regulations for
businesses; consider regulating signage by use and by zone;
         (b)   Promote convenient access and signage to parking in all
commercial areas; and

   (D)   Prohibited Signs:
      1.   General: The following signs are expressly prohibited in all zoning
districts:
         (a)   Animated signs;
         (b)   Windblown signs including nonpermanent advertising signs affixed
to buildings, fences or other structures (except temporary banners, windblown

organizations which must be removed within 48 hours after the end of the
event);
         (c)   Strings of lights (except for temporary holiday decorations);
         (d)   Portable signs (except sandwich board signs);

14-7-5(B)2 of this chapter.
      2.   List Not Exclusive: The list of prohibited sign types set out in
this section is illustrative only. Any sign that is not exempt from this
chapter under subsection (B) of this section, not established as a lawful
nonconforming sign in accordance with section
14-12-7 of this title, or not expressly allowed under another section of this
chapter, is a prohibited sign.
   (E)   Applicability: No display sign or outdoor advertising device may be
placed, erected, altered, rebuilt, enlarged, extended or relocated except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter. The repainting, changing of
parts, and preventative maintenance of signs are not considered alterations.
(Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-7-2: GENERAL:
   (A)   Sign Measurement And Interpretation:
      1.   Measurement Of Copy Area Of Individual Signs: The copy area of a
sign face will be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material
or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed. The copy area of a sign face does not include any supporting framework,
bracing or decorative fence or wall when the fence or wall otherwise meets the
regulations of this chapter and is clearly incidental to the display itself.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2496.gif]
 
      2.   Measurement Of Area Of Multifaced Signs: Where the sign faces of a
double faced sign are parallel and the distance between the faces is three feet
(3') or less, only one display face will be measured in computing sign area. If
the two (2) faces of a double faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the
sign will be the area of the larger sign. In all other cases, the areas of all
faces of a multifaced sign will be added together to compute the area of the
sign.
      3.   Sign Height Measurement: The height of a sign will be computed as
the distance from the highest point of the sign structure to the elevation of
the centerline of the adjacent public street or highway.
      4.   Determination Of Visibility Or Legibility:
         (a)   Where this chapter requires a determination of "visibility" or
"legibility", the standard will be based on the eyesight of an adult eligible
to receive an Illinois driver's license (wearing any corrective lenses required
by the license). Where the height of the person is material to the
determination, the person will be presumed to be more than five feet (5') and
less than six feet (6') tall.
         (b)   In determining visibility of a sign from a residential property,
it will be assumed that a two-story residence will occupy the property with
second story windows facing toward the sign.
   (B)   Wind Pressure: Any sign, other advertising structure, marquee, canopy
or awning as defined in this title must be designed and constructed to
withstand a wind pressure of not less than thirty (30) pounds per square foot
of net surface area; and must be constructed to receive dead loads as required
in the building code and/or other ordinances of the city of Spring Valley.
   (C)   Substitution Of Messages: The sign regulations of this chapter are not
intended to favor commercial speech over constitutionally protected political
or noncommercial speech. A sign containing a noncommercial message may be
substituted for any sign containing a commercial message that is allowed by the
regulations of this chapter.
      1.   Any sign allowed under this title may contain, in lieu of any other
message or copy, any lawful noncommercial message that does not direct
attention to a business operated for profit, or to a product, commodity or
service for sale or lease, or to any other commercial interest or activity, so
long as the sign complies with the size, height, area and other requirements of
this chapter.
      2.   At any time, in lieu of any permitted temporary real estate sign, a
sign expressing views on candidates or issues of public interest may be
erected, regardless of whether the property is at that time for sale or lease.
The number, height and size of the sign will be the same as the real estate
sign that would otherwise be permitted. It is not the intent of this paragraph
to allow additional signage on the property; but rather to clarify that, in
accordance with the policy set forth in this section, a sign expressing
opinions may be substituted for any other sign allowed under this chapter.
(Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-7-3: SIGNS IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY AND ON PUBLIC PROPERTY:
   (A)   Signs Permitted: Only the following signs are permitted in the public
right of way and on public property:
      1.   Signs installed by any of the following and directly related to the
use of the right of way or of public property, including the control and
direction of traffic:
         (a)   The city of Spring Valley;
         (b)   Bureau County;
         (c)   State of Illinois;
         (d)   Any transit company authorized to provide service to or through
Spring Valley;
         (e)   Any public utility with a franchise or other agreement with the
city of Spring Valley; or
         (f)   Any other government entity or person expressly authorized by
Illinois law to install a sign in the right of way.
      2.   "Adopt-a-highway" signs acknowledging voluntary efforts to provide
landscaping, litter control, or other maintenance, when the signs are installed
pursuant to a written policy of the city of Spring Valley or the state of
Illinois.
   (B)   Other Signs: Any other sign installed or placed in the public right of
way will be deemed an unlawful sign and an abandoned sign and will be subject
to immediate removal and disposal by the city, without compensation to the
owner. The owner or other person placing the sign will, nevertheless, be
subject to the penalty provisions of chapter 13 of this title. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-
2008)

or where the first message gradually reduces intensity to the point of not
being legible and the subsequent message gradually increases intensity to the
point of legibility.
   FLASHING: A pattern of changing light illumination where the sign
illumination alternates suddenly between fully illuminated and fully
nonilluminated for the purpose of drawing attention to the sign.
   FOOT-CANDLE: One foot-candle is the equivalent light that a single wax
candle would produce if it were viewed from one foot (1') away.
   FOREGROUND ANIMATION: The use of movement or some element thereof, to depict
action or create a special effect or scene in the foreground of the sign.
   SCROLLING: Where the message is changed by the apparent vertical movement of
the letters or graphic elements of the message.

In addition, the city of Spring Valley shall notify adjacent communities in
writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration
or relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 1490, 8-1-2011)
14-8-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the city of Spring Valley
zoning board of appeals for a variance. The zoning board of appeals shall
review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its
recommendation to the Spring Valley city council. The city council may attach
such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the
intent of this chapter.
   (A)   Conditions: No variance shall be granted unless the applicant
demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   Notification: The Spring Valley zoning board of appeals shall notify
an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of the building
protection standards of section
14-8-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic Structures:
      1.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
14-8-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
the term "historic structure" in section
14-8-2 of this chapter, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
14-8-6 and
14-8-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
         (a)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         (b)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and
wet floodproofed.
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farmhouses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
section
14-8-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
14-8-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section
14-8-7 of this chapter.
      6.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with subsection
14-8-7(B) of this chapter.
      7.   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of section
14-8-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      8.   Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction. (Ord. 1490, 8-1-2011)
14-8-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city of Spring Valley or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 1490, 8-1-2011)
14-8-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the building inspector may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
city shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city of Spring Valley shall make application to the circuit
court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such
other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this
chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The city of Spring Valley shall record a notice of violation on the
title of the property.
   (B)   The city attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The city attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of
the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate the
reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve
the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the zoning board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing
shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the zoning board of appeal
shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Spring Valley from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord.
1490, 8-1-2011)
14-8-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city of
Spring Valley to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance
program. However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or
ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants or
deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1490, 8-1-2011)

      1.   Whenever the plan commission determines that a park, recreation
area, school site, library or other public space should be located in whole or
in part in the proposed subdivision, the plan commission will request the
dedication of those sites or will require their reservation for a period of one
year following the date of the final approval of the subdivision plat. If a
governmental agency passes a resolution expressing its intent to acquire the
reserved land within the reservation year, the reservation period will be
extended for one additional year.
      2.   Land to be dedicated to the public must be labeled on the final plat
as follows: "Dedicated to the (public agency) for (intended use of dedicated
land)".
      3.   All lands offered to the city for use as streets, alleys, schools,

topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
      2.   In the case of tentative plats for parts of tracts, where it appears
necessary to the plan commission for the satisfactory overall development of an
area, an owner may be required to prepare at least a street plan of his entire
tract based upon proper topographic surveys before approval of any portion of
such plan.
      3.   Whenever an area is subdivided into lots of forty thousand (40,000)
square feet or more that may at a later date be resubdivided, consideration
must be given to the street and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so
that additional minor streets can be located to permit a logical arrangement of
smaller lots.

reservation along the rear property line;
         (c)   Deep lots with rear service alleys;
         (d)   Other treatments as necessary for protection of residential
properties and to separate through and local traffic.
      2.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way
or limited access highway right of way, the plan commission may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right of way, at a
distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, for park
purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
the appropriate districts. Such distances must be determined also with due
regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.

      1.   "Standard Specifications For Water And Sewer Main Construction In
Illinois".
      2.   "Standard Specifications For Road And Bridge Construction", Illinois
department of transportation.
      3.   "Design Manual", state of Illinois, department of public works and
buildings, division of highways, bureau of design.
      4.   "Highway Standards", state of Illinois, department of public works
and building division of highways, bureau of design.
      5.   "Manual Of Policies And Procedures", location and environment,
Illinois department of transportation.
      6.   Standards adopted by the metropolitan sanitary district of Greater
Chicago.

or public way, and no drain may discharge onto any public street or alley at a
height greater than eighteen inches (18") above grade.
   (G)   Storm Sewers For Impervious Areas:
      1.   Storm sewers and catch basins must be provided for all impervious
surface areas larger than seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet when
a public storm sewer is no more than one hundred feet (100') from the property
line measured along a public right of way or sewer system easement.
      2.   One catch basin must be provided for the first thirty thousand
(30,000) square feet of impervious area and one additional catch basin must be
provided for every additional ten thousand (10,000) square feet of impervious
area or fraction thereof.

street or an existing open watercourse. No drainage may be allowed to pass onto
adjoining property or over public sidewalks unless at the point where a
driveway intersects the sidewalk.
   (H)   Subdivisions: No plat may be approved for a subdivision that is
subject to periodic flooding or which contains poor drainage facilities and
which would make adequate drainage of the lots and streets impossible. However,
if the subdivider agrees to make improvements that will, in the opinion of the
city engineer, make the area safe for residential occupancy and provide
adequate lot and street drainage, the preliminary plat of the subdivision may
be approved.
   (I)   Connection Of Sanitary Wastes To Storm Sewers Or Watercourses: No
sanitary sewage may discharge into any portion of the city storm drainage
system or any watercourse.
   (J)   Storm Sewer Capacity:
      1.   Storm sewer capacities must be designed for a minimum 10-year storm
frequency. Storm sewer capacities will be determined using the rational formula
(Q = CiA, where Q = peak runoff rate in cubic feet/second, C = runoff
coefficient, i = average intensity of rainfall in inches/hour, A = drainage
area in acres).
      2.   When stormwater storage is required, provision must be made to
transport stormwater runoff from a 100-year storm frequency from the fully
developed area of the site to the stormwater storage area. The additional
stormwater runoff resulting from the design for a 100-year storm frequency may
be transported to the stormwater storage area over streets, parking areas,
parks, playgrounds or other open spaces, including utility easements.
      3.   The storm sewer system must have adequate capacity to adequately
drain all tributary drainage areas through the property, and there will be no
compensation to the owner or developer by the city for the increased pipe sizes
and construction costs, if any.
      4.   In any subdivision, lot, or parcel of land where it is determined by
the city engineer that the storm sewer would be larger than ninety six inches
(96"), based on a 20-year storm frequency, then a ditch or drainage channel
meeting the following standards may be used if the council so approves.
         (a)   With grades to four percent (4%), ditch may have earth bottoms
and sod banks.
         (b)   With grades greater than four percent (4%), ditches must be
paved.
         (c)   All ditches must have side slopes of not less than three to one
(3:1).
         (d)   Easements for all ditches must be dedicated to the city and
there must be provided in addition to the necessary width required for the
ditch, a strip of land on each side of the ditch of a width of fifteen feet
(15'), such distance to be measured perpendicular to trees, poles, structures
and other obstructions. The slope of these side areas to the ditch may not
exceed five percent (5%). There may be no trees, bushes, or obstructions of any
kind placed in this area.
         (e)   Culverts or bridges must be provided at all street crossings and
must be sized to eliminate flooding or ponding of water and must have a minimum
cover of twelve inches (12"). Culverts or bridges must be reinforced concrete
or precast reinforced concrete pipes with necessary headwalls. Culverts or
bridges must extend a minimum of five feet (5') past each right of way line of
the street and must extend far enough to provide a minimum slope of three to
one (3:1) from the right of way line down to the invert of the pipe.
         (f)   All ditches, bridges and culverts must be located and designed
in accordance with current applicable standards as amended from time to time
and requirements of the city engineer.
         (g)   All culverts or bridges must be provided with suitable railings
and/or guardrails as required and approved by the city.
   (K)   Manholes And Catch Basins: Manholes must be provided at all changes in
direction and at intermediate points not exceeding three hundred fifty feet
(350') apart. Catch basins with curb inlets must be provided as required by the
"Design Manual", state of Illinois, department of public works and buildings.
   (L)   Stormwater Storage Facilities:
      1.   Where Required:
         (a)   Nonresidential Development: A properly designed stormwater
storage facility must be provided by the developer of all nonresidential
developments that contain an area greater than one acre or, if less than one
acre, where fifty percent (50%) or more of the area is covered with impervious
improvements, unless an approved facility exists for the property. This
requirement does not apply to replacement of improvements on property in cases
where the impervious coverage of the development is not increased.
         (b)   Residential Development: Stormwater storage must be provided for
all residential developments larger than two (2) acres. This requirement does
not apply to replacement of improvements on property in cases where the
impervious coverage of the development is not increased.
      2.   Basis Of Design:
         (a)   The necessary volume of stormwater storage will be calculated on
the basis of a 100-year storm frequency using the criteria established by the
metropolitan sanitary district of Greater Chicago. The volume required will be
that necessary to handle the runoff for a 100-year storm for any and all
durations, from the fully developed drainage area of the site tributary to the
reservoir less that volume discharged during the same duration as the allowable
release rate.
         (b)   No stormwater storage will be required for off site upstream
areas.
         (c)   Flows from off site tributary areas resulting from a 10-year
storm frequency will be drained through the storm sewer system provided for the
site. Off site flow in excess of the 10-year storm frequency must be bypassed
through the site as overland flow and must be calculated using the 100-year
storm frequency.
   (M)   Allowable Release Rate: The allowable release rate of stormwater
runoff from the developed drainage area of the site must not exceed the
existing capacity of the downstream storm sewer system or drainage channel, but
in no case may the discharge be more than the runoff of the existing site using
a "C" factor of 0.2 and a 5-year rainfall frequency in the rational formula. No
outlet pipe may be of a diameter of less than eight inches (8") and of a
diameter so as not to restrict the designed allowable release rate from any
stormwater storage facility. Outlet control facilities other than pipes must be
constructed of reinforced concrete. Outlet pipes from storage areas must be
approved by the city. This limitation applies only to improvements constructed
pursuant to building permits applied for after the effective date specified in
section
14-1-2 of this title.
   (N)   Bypass:
      1.   The drainage system that is provided for the site must have adequate
capacity to safely bypass through the development the flow resulting from a
100-year storm frequency from all upstream areas assuming the land is in a
fully developed state under present zoning or proposed zoning outlined in the
comprehensive plan. The flow must be calculated using a runoff coefficient of
not less than 0.50. An allowance must be made for any upstream stormwater
storage that has actually been provided.
      2.   The required bypass area for stormwater in excess of the volume
handled by the storm sewer system may consist of streets, parking areas, parks,
playgrounds or other open spaces, including utility easements. There may be no
habitable structures located within this bypass area that is used as a
floodway, and this bypass area may not be reshaped or restricted in any way to
reduce its effective capacity.
      3.   The design of the bypass area must take into consideration the
control of the stormwater velocity to prevent erosion. The side slopes on any
drainage swale may not be steeper than three to one (3:1).
   (O)   Stormwater Storage Areas: The required volume of stormwater storage
may be provided in paved parking areas and in reservoirs with either a wet or
dry bottom. Alternate types of stormwater storage areas must be approved by the
city engineer.
      1.   Parking Areas: The stormwater storage areas must be designed so that
the accumulation of water at any point in the parking lot during peak rainfall
does not exceed eight inches (8"). The parking lot must be sloped to drain at a
minimum of one percent (1%). The finished floor elevation of all buildings must
be set so that no damage would occur if a storm in excess of the 100-year storm
frequency occurs or if the drainage outlet becomes plugged.
      2.   Dry Bottom Reservoirs:
         (a)   A dry bottom type of reservoir may be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types of uses that will
not be adversely affected by periodic flooding.
         (b)   A paved ditch with a slope of not less than 0.50 percent will be
required from the inlet pipe or structure to the outlet pipe or structure to
prevent erosion of the bottom of the reservoir when the capacity of the inlet
pipe exceeds five (5) cfs or when the inlet pipe has a constant flow, even
during dry weather. In certain cases, dry bottom reservoirs must have a pipe
underdrain system as required by the city engineer. The paved ditch must meet
the requirements for paved ditches contained in the "Highway Standards", state
of Illinois, department of public works and buildings, division of highways,
bureau of design.
         (c)   The grassed bottom of the reservoir must slope to drain to the
outlet or paved ditch at a minimum of one percent (1%) slope. The side slopes
on the earth berm around the reservoir must not be steeper than four to one (4:
1) and the earth berm at the top may not be less than ten feet (10') wide.
         (d)   The inlet and outlet pipes or structures from the reservoir must
be self-operating and require very limited maintenance. An emergency overflow
spillway must be provided from the reservoir in the event a storm in excess of
the 100-year storm frequency occurs. The inlet and outlet pipes or structures
must be provided with safety bars with maximum openings of six inches (6") to
provide for the safety of children.
      3.   Wet Bottom Reservoirs:
         (a)   Wet bottom storage reservoirs must be constructed to conform to
the current applicable requirements. The minimum depth from the normal water
level to the bottom of the side slope must be four feet (4'). A minimum of
twenty five percent (25%) of the pond area must be constructed to a minimum
depth of ten feet (10') to provide for fish.
         (b)   Proper measures must be provided by the developer to prevent the
water from becoming stagnant.
         (c)   Where the soil in the bottom of the reservoir is too permeable
to hold water, the bottom must be sealed by an accepted method approved by the
city engineer.
         (d)   The inlet and outlet pipes or structures from the reservoir must
be self-operating and require very limited maintenance. An emergency overflow
spillway must be provided from the reservoir in the event a storm in excess of
the 100-year storm frequency occurs. The inlet and outlet pipes or structures
must be provided with safety bars with maximum openings of six inches (6") to
provide for the safety of children.
   (P)   Requirements During Construction: Construction operations must be
conducted in such a manner as to minimize erosion potential on the site.
Silting of off site downstream areas must be controlled through the appropriate
use of sedimentation basins, including retention/detention facilities designed
for that purpose, provided that such facilities will be restored to their prior
design configuration upon completion of construction operations. The developer
must indicate the methods and timing of construction to be used for the control
of siltation during construction operations at the time that final engineering
plans are submitted for approval.
   (Q)   Approval: All work required to be done under this section must be
periodically inspected by and approval obtained from the city superintendent in
charge, or city engineer as the work progresses. When the work is completed,
final approval must be obtained from the city superintendent in charge or city
engineer. Before final approval can be obtained, the superintendent in charge
or city engineer must inspect all work and see that it has been completed in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications.
   (R)   Stormwater Management Facility Maintenance:
      1.   Routine Maintenance: The homeowners' association whose property or
common area includes all or a portion of an open drainage swale, channel,
detention basin or other stormwater management facilities will be held
responsible for the mowing of grass, removal of debris or obstructions to the
flow of water in or through such facilities, removal of silt, and maintenance
and repair due to erosion.
      2.   Nonroutine Maintenance:
         (a)   Nonroutine maintenance, including maintenance activities that
are expensive but infrequent, such as pond dredging or major repairs to
stormwater structures, must be performed on an as needed basis based on
information gathered during regular inspections.
         (b)   A legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible
for proper maintenance of all stormwater management facilities must be provided
by the developer and approved by the city prior to final plat approval, or for
properties not subject to the plat approval process, prior to the issuance of
site plan approval or building permits, whichever comes first.
         (c)   The maintenance agreement must include a description of
maintenance and repair procedures to be completed, including identification of
components that need to be maintained and standards for maintenance.
      3.   Inspections:
         (a)   The persons or organizations responsible for maintenance must
inspect stormwater management facilities on a regular basis, as outlined in the
maintenance agreement.
         (b)   Authorized representatives of the city of Spring Valley may
enter at reasonable times upon any time to conduct on site inspections or
routine maintenance. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)

14-11-4: SPECIAL USES:
Special uses require individual review by the plan commission and city council
to ensure conformance with the intent of the comprehensive plan and to assess
whether the proposed use is compatible with surrounding uses. The review and
approval procedures are described in sections
14-11-5 and
14-11-6 of this chapter. Special uses fit into two (2) basic categories:
   (A)   Single Uses: Single uses or single aspects of permitted uses
specifically identified in this chapter as requiring individual review under
the special use procedure of section
14-11-5 of this chapter.
   (B)   Planned Developments: Complex projects designed to take maximum
advantage of unique site characteristics and use original design concepts are
submitted for review under the planned development procedure of section
14-11-6 of this chapter.
      1.   Purpose: The planned development regulations are intended to:
         (a)   Encourage better development within the city by providing more
flexibility in the application of the provisions of this title;
         (b)   Allow smaller lots when permanent common open space is provided;
         (c)   Allow more than one principal structure on a lot;
         (d)   Allow development where lots do not abut a dedicated and
improved street;
         (e)   Permit diversity in the location of structures; and
         (f)   Shorten the total time involved in the rezoning of property and
subdivision of land.
      2.   Types Of Planned Developments: The following are specific types and
purposes of planned developments:
         (a)   Residential Planned Developments: Residential planned
developments are intended to offer recreational opportunities close to home;
enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by the conservation of streams and
local spots of natural beauty; add to the sense of spaciousness through the
preservation of natural green spaces; counteract the effects of urban monotony
and congestion in the streets; encourage cooperative relationships between
neighbors and participation by all age groups in the use and care of local open
space tracts in new residential subdivisions; and promote harmonious
architecture between adjacent dwellings or in sympathy with the natural
characteristics of the site.
         (b)   Shopping Center Planned Developments: Shopping center planned
developments are intended to promote the cooperative development of shopping
centers each with adequate off street parking; control access points on
arterial and collector streets; separate pedestrian and automobile traffic; aid
in stabilizing property values; develop shopping centers of size and location
compatible with the market potential; buffer adjacent residential areas with
landscaped green spaces; and encourage harmonious architecture between homes
and commercial structures.
         (c)   Manufacturing Planned Development: Manufacturing planned
developments are intended to promote the establishment of planned industrial
areas; permit groups of industrial buildings with integrated design and a
coordinated physical plan; encourage recreational facilities within industrial
areas; and buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped green areas. (Ord.

and become null and void.
         2.   The city council may, at its discretion and upon adequate showing
of good cause, extend the period of validity of special use approval for a
period not to exceed twelve (12) months. The plan commission must receive a
written request from the applicant prior to the expiration of the special use
approval stating the reasons for the proposed extension.
         3.   If a special use is discontinued for a period of six (6) months
or longer, the special use will be considered abandoned and become null and
void. Any reinstatement of the special use will require special use approval
according to the procedures of this section.

with the within plat. This subdivision will be known and designated as (Name).
All streets and alleys and public open spaces shown, and not heretofore
dedicated, are hereby dedicated to the public. Setbacks are hereby established
as shown on this plat, between which lines and the property lines of the
streets, there will be erected or maintained no building or structure. There
are strips of ground, (Number) feet in width, as shown on this plat and marked
`Easement` reserved for the use of public utilities for the installation of
water and sewer mains, ducts, lines, and wires, subject at all times to the
proper authorities and to the easement herein reserved. No permanent or other
structures are to be erected or maintained upon said strips of land, but owners
of lots in this subdivision will take their titles subject to the rights of the
public utilities, and to the rights of the owners of other lots in this
subdivision. (Additional dedications and protective covenants, or private
restrictions, would be inserted here upon the subdivider's initiative or the
recommendation of the Plan Commission or City Council; important provisions are
those specifying the use to be made of the property and, in the case of
residential use, the minimum habitable floor area.) The foregoing covenants (or
restrictions) are to run with the land and will be binding on all parties and
all persons claiming under them until January 1, 20 (twenty-five- year period
is suggested); at which time, said covenants (or restrictions) will be
automatically extended for successive periods of ten years unless indicated
otherwise by negative vote of a majority of the then owners of the building
sites covered by these covenants (or restrictions) in whole or in part, which
said vote will be evidenced by a petition in writing signed by the owners and
duly recorded. Invalidation of any one of the foregoing covenants (or
restrictions) by judgment or court order will in no way affect any of the other
various covenants or restrictions, which will remain in full force and effect.
The right to enforce these provisions by injunction together with the right to
cause the removal, by due process of law, of any structure or part thereof
erected or maintained in violation thereof, is hereby dedicated to the public
and reserved to the several owners of the several lots in this subdivision and
to their heirs and assigns."

CHAPTER 12
NONCONFORMITIES
SECTION:
14-12-1: Purpose
14-12-2: Scope
14-12-3: Provisions Of General Applicability
14-12-4: Nonconforming Uses
14-12-5: Nonconforming Buildings And Structures
14-12-6: Nonconforming Lots Of Record
14-12-7: Nonconforming Signs
14-12-8: Other Nonconformities
14-12-1: PURPOSE:
The regulations of this chapter govern uses, structures, lots and other
situations that came into existence lawfully but do not comply with one or more
requirements of this title. These types of situations are said to be
nonconforming. The intent of this chapter is to clarify the effect of such
nonconforming status and avoid their confusion with illegal buildings and uses.
These regulations recognize the interests of landowners in continuing to use
and maintain their properties for uses and activities that were lawfully
established. The regulations also seek to encourage continued maintenance,
rehabilitation, and reuse of existing buildings and structures. However, these
regulations also place limitations on nonconformities that have the potential
to adversely affect surrounding properties. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-12-2: SCOPE:
This chapter applies to nonconformities created by the adoption of this title
or subsequent amendments to it. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-12-3: PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY:
   (A)   Continuation Permitted: Any nonconformity that lawfully existed on the
date of adoption of this title or that becomes nonconforming upon the adoption
of any amendment to this title may be continued in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Illegal Uses, Buildings, And Structures: Uses, buildings, and
structures that were not lawfully established prior to adoption of this title
will not become legal by virtue of its enactment. Illegal uses, buildings, and
structures must be immediately brought into compliance with all ordinances of
the city.
   (C)   Determination Of Nonconforming Status: The burden of establishing that
a nonconformity exists will, in all cases, be upon the property owner of the
nonconforming use, building or structure and not upon the city.
   (D)   Replacement Value: Replacement value for all structures will be
interpreted as the assessed value of the improvement based on information
obtained from the township assessor unless the applicant provides replacement
value data prepared by a certified appraiser. When assessed value data is not
available and the subject owner has not provided appraisal data, the zoning
administrator is authorized to determine replacement value based on the best
available data.
   (E)   Repairs And Maintenance: Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of
nonconforming situations are permitted to maintain a property in sound
condition, unless expressly prohibited by this title or other city ordinances.
Examples of normal maintenance and incidental repairs include installation or
relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, equipment,
wiring, roofing, and plumbing. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to
prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe
condition, in accordance with an official order of a public official.
   (F)   Safety Regulations: All police power regulations enacted to promote
the public health, safety, and welfare including, but not limited to, all
building, fire, and health codes, apply to nonconforming uses, buildings and
structures.
   (G)   Tenancy And Ownership: The status of a nonconformity is not affected
by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management. Nonconforming status "runs
with the land". (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-12-4: NONCONFORMING USES:
A nonconforming use is one that was lawfully established in accordance with the
zoning regulations at the time it was established, but no longer complies with
the standards of this title.
   (A)   Continuation: Nonconforming uses may remain, subject to the
regulations of this section.
   (B)   Alteration And Expansion:
      1.   Except as expressly prohibited by this section, the zoning
administrator is authorized to permit a nonconforming use to expand into
another part of the same building or alter or expand the existing building,
provided that the zoning administrator determines that such alteration or
expansion:
         (a)   Will not result in a violation of off street parking or loading
requirements;
         (b)   Will not violate any applicable dimensional standards;
         (c)   Will not result in greater adverse impacts on the surrounding
area, with respect to noise, traffic generation, odor, or other environmental
effects; and
         (d)   Is not expressly prohibited by subsection (B)2 of this section.
      2.   The following nonconforming uses may not be expanded:
         (a)   A nonconforming business or manufacturing use in an R district;
         (b)   A nonconforming residential use in a business or manufacturing
district if such expansion increases the number of dwelling units or the area
of the zoning lot.
   (C)   Relocation: A nonconforming use may not be relocated in whole, or in
part, to any other lot or parcel unless the relocation brings the use into
compliance with all regulations of the zoning district into which it is
relocated.
   (D)   Change Or Substitution Of Use:
      1.   Except as otherwise expressly authorized, a nonconforming use may
not be changed to any use other than a use allowed within the zoning district
in which the use is located. When a nonconforming use has been changed, in
whole or in part, to an allowed use, it may not be changed back to a use that
is not allowed. A change of use will be deemed to occur when an existing
nonconforming use has been terminated and an allowed use has commenced. Any
change in use in violation of this chapter will be deemed an abandonment of the
previous nonconforming use.
      2.   The zoning administrator has the authority to permit the
substitution of one nonconforming use for another nonconforming use within the
same use category, provided that the substituted use will create no greater
adverse impacts on the surrounding area than the previous use. In making such a
determination, the zoning administrator must consider the following factors:
         (a)   Hours of operation;
         (b)   Vehicular traffic generation;
         (c)   The number of employees, patrons, or other people expected to be
attracted to the use; and
         (d)   Other factors likely to affect the neighborhood in which the use
is located.
      3.   If the zoning administrator approves a use substitution, the
previous nonconforming use is deemed to have been abandoned. In permitting such
a change in use, the zoning administrator may impose conditions on the
substituting nonconforming use.
   (E)   Loss Of Nonconforming Status; Damage Or Destruction:
      1.   If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of twelve (12)
continuous months or more all nonconforming use rights are lost and
reestablishment of the nonconforming use is prohibited.
      2.   If a building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use is
damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood, or other means that is not
within the control of the property owner or tenant, to an extent of more than
fifty percent (50%) of the replacement value of the building and/or structure
it may not be reestablished except in compliance with all regulations
applicable to the zoning district in which it is located. This provision does
not apply to single-family dwellings, which may be reestablished in any zoning
district in compliance with subsection (E)3 of this section.
      3.   If a building, structure, or property occupied by a nonconforming
use is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the control of the
property owner or tenant, to an extent of fifty percent (50%) or less of the
replacement value, it may be repaired, reconstructed, or restored provided that
no new nonconformities are created and that the existing degree of
nonconformity is not increased. A building permit must be obtained for such
rebuilding, restoration, repair, or reconstruction within one year of the date
of damage or destruction, and the construction must be completed within one
year of issuance of the building permit. If a building permit is not obtained
within one year or the repairs or restoration are not completed within one year
of the issuance of the building permit, then the building and/or structure and
use may be reestablished only if it complies with all regulations of the
district in which it is located.
      4.   In the event that any building, structure, or property occupied by a
nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by a means within the control of the
property owner or tenant, the building and/or structure and use may be restored
or repaired only in compliance with all regulations of this title.
(Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008; amd. Ord. 1746, 4-22-2019)
14-12-5: NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES:
A nonconforming building or structure is one that was lawfully established in
accordance with the zoning regulations in effect at the time of its
establishment but that is no longer in compliance with one or more standards of
this title. Common examples of nonconforming buildings or structures are those
that do not comply with current setback, height, or building coverage
requirements.
   (A)   Continuation: Nonconforming buildings or structures may remain,
subject to the regulations of this section.
   (B)   Use: A nonconforming building or structure may be utilized for or
occupied by any use allowed in the applicable zoning district, subject to all
applicable use standards of chapter 3 of this title.
   (C)   Alteration And Expansion: The zoning administrator is authorized to
permit the alteration, expansion, enlargement, or increase in size of a
nonconforming building or structure provided that the zoning administrator
determines that such alteration or expansion:
      1.   Will not result in a violation of off street parking or loading
requirements; and
      2.   Will not create any new nonconformities with respect to bulk or
density standards; and
      3.   In the case of an addition that will expand a nonconforming
building, the addition will not encroach any further into the existing
setbacks, further increase nonconforming building height, or increase
nonconforming building coverage.
   (D)   Relocation: A nonconforming building or structure may not be relocated
in whole, or in part, to any other location on the same lot or parcel, or to
any other lot or parcel, unless the relocation brings the building or structure
into further or full compliance with the regulations of the zoning district in
which it is relocated. This provision may not be interpreted as prohibiting the
elevation of a nonconforming building or structure for the purpose of
floodproofing or repair.
   (E)   Loss Of Nonconforming Status; Damage Or Destruction:
      1.   If a nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed by
fire, explosion, flood, or other means that is not within the control of the
property owner or tenant, to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
replacement value of the building or structure it may not be reestablished
except in compliance with all regulations applicable to the zoning district in
which it is located. This provision does not apply to single- family dwellings,
which may be fully reestablished in any zoning district in compliance with
subsection (E)2 of this section.
      2.   If a nonconforming building or structure is damaged or destroyed by
any means not within the control of the property owner or tenant to an extent
of fifty percent (50%) or less of the replacement value, it may be repaired,
reconstructed, or restored provided that no new nonconformities are created and
that the existing degree of nonconformity is not increased. A building permit
must be obtained for such rebuilding, restoration, repair, or reconstruction
within one year of the date of damage or destruction, and the construction must
be completed within one year of issuance of the building permit. If a building
permit is not obtained within one year or the repairs or restoration are not
completed within one year of the issuance of the building permit, then the
building or structure and use may be reestablished only if it complies with all
regulations of the district in which it is located.
      3.   In the event that any nonconforming building or structure is damaged
or destroyed by a means within the control of the property owner or tenant, the
building or structure and use may be restored or repaired only in compliance
with all requirements of this title.
(Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008; amd. Ord. 1746, 4-22-2019)
14-12-6: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
A nonconforming lot of record is a tract of land designated on a duly recorded
subdivision plat, by a duly recorded deed, or by other lawful means that does
not comply with minimum lot area or lot width regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located. No nonconforming lot of record may be improved
except in compliance with this section.
   (A)   Use: Any lot in single ownership that became nonconforming upon the
effective date specified in section
14-1-2 of this title or any subsequent amendment and does not meet the
requirements of this title for lot area or lot width may be developed with a
use that is permitted within the applicable district, provided it meets the
standards of this section. The owner of a nonconforming lot of record must
furnish the following additional information with the application for a
building permit:
      1.   A survey by a duly licensed land surveyor, showing the lot upon
which the applicant proposes to build and at least a portion of the lots on
either side of such lot including the width of the adjoining existing side
setbacks as measured to the nearest part of the buildings or structures
thereon.
      2.   An affidavit by the owner of the lot described in the application
for a building permit, stating that no adjoining lots are currently under his
or her ownership.
   (B)   Criteria For Use Of Nonconforming Lots Of Record: Upon compliance with
the provisions of subsection (A) of this section and other applicable
provisions of this title, the zoning administrator may issue a building permit
if the subject lot and proposed development meets the following criteria:
      1.   The nonconforming lot is not adjoining and contiguous to a lot on
either side held under common ownership;
      2.   The nonconforming lot is at least two thousand five hundred (2,500)
square feet in area and twenty five feet (25') in width and was platted on or
before the effective date of this title;
      3.   If the underlying zoning district permits a variety of uses, only
one or some of which would meet the dimensional standards for lot area, width,
or yards, then only those uses that comply with applicable dimensional and use
standards will be permitted; and
      4.   The proposed development on the nonconforming lot will comply with
all other bulk and density standards of the subject zoning district. (Ord.
1379, 6-9-2008)
14-12-7: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
Nonconforming signs are those that were lawfully established but no longer
comply with the sign regulations of this title.
   (A)   Continuation: A nonconforming sign may remain, subject to the
regulations of this section.
   (B)   Alteration And Expansion: A nonconforming sign cannot be enlarged,
expanded or otherwise improved except for the purpose of normal maintenance and
incidental repairs. The only alteration to a nonconforming sign that is
permitted is a change in the sign face, the words or symbols used or the
message displayed, only to advertise an activity, business, or use conducted or
a product sold on the premises where the sign is located, provided that the
sign is not abandoned, as defined in subsection (E) of this section. Any other
alteration or change must be to bring the nonconforming sign into compliance
with the regulations of this title.
   (C)   Relocation: A nonconforming sign cannot be relocated in whole or in
part to any other location unless the relocation results in the entire sign
being brought into compliance with all applicable regulations of this title.
   (D)   Loss Of Nonconforming Status; Damage Or Destruction: If a
nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the control
of the property owner to the extent that the estimated expense of repairs
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value, the sign must be removed
or otherwise brought into compliance with the regulations of this title.
Removal of a nonconforming sign must include removal of the sign face, all
support structures and lighting apparatus.
   (E)   Abandonment: Any nonconforming sign that no longer advertises an
activity, business, or use conducted or a product sold on the premises where
the sign is located will be deemed to be abandoned after a period of ninety
(90) days. All abandoned signs must be removed or brought into full compliance
with the regulations of this title. (Ord. 1379, 6-9-2008)
14-12-8: OTHER NONCONFORMITIES:
The types of other nonconformities to which this section applies include, but
are not limited to, landscaping, off street parking and loading, curb cuts,
accessory buildings or structures (except nonconforming signs) and other
nonconformities not involving signs, structural aspects of a principal
building, lot dimensions, or use of the property.
   (A)   Continuation: Other nonconformities, as defined by this section, may
remain subject to the regulations of this section.
   (B)   Alteration And Expansion: Unless otherwise stated in this title, the
zoning administrator is authorized to permit the alteration, expansion, or
enlargement of buildings, structures or other site improvement on sites with
other nonconformities, provided that the zoning administrator determines that
such alteration or expansion will not increase the degree of nonconformity. An
alteration or expansion or to a building that increases the number of required
parking spaces or further reduces the amount of landscaping (where the existing
number of parking spaces or amount of landscaping is currently not in
compliance with this title) are examples of increases in the degree of
nonconformity.
   (C)   Reduction In Nonconformities: Over time, it is the intent of this
title to eliminate or reduce the degree of nonconformities to the maximum
extent feasible as buildings, sites, or parking areas are redeveloped or
expanded. Examples of the manner in which nonconformities could be reduced are
the following:
      1.   Construction of additional parking spaces on sites that do not meet
parking requirements; and
      2.   Installation of required landscaping within a newly constructed
portion of a parking lot that does not meet landscaping requirements. (Ord.
1379, 6-9-2008)
